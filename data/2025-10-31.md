### [1] [StreetMath: Study of LLMs' Approximation Behaviors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25776)
*Chiung-Yi Tseng,Somshubhra Roy,Maisha Thasin,Danyang Zhang,Blessing Effiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StreetMath benchmark evaluates LLMs' approximation abilities in real-world scenarios, revealing they prefer exact computations over approximation and lack human-like cognitive miserliness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding LLMs' ability to perform approximate reasoning in informal mathematical operations, particularly for non-autoregressive decoder models.

Method: Introduced StreetMath benchmark and conducted evaluations across multiple LLM architectures (Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507, Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507, Dream-v0-Instruct-7B, Falcon-Mamba-7B-Instruct, Mamba-GPT-3B) using mechanistic interpretability techniques to probe internal computational states.

Result: LLMs generally attempt exact computations or use external tools even when approximation is required; correct answers sometimes appear in early layers but models still consume more tokens; exact and approximate arithmetic operations use largely separate neural components.

Conclusion: LLMs do not exhibit human-like cognitive miserliness in street math settings, preferring precise calculations over efficient approximations.

Abstract: There is a substantial body of literature examining the mathematical
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
performance on precise arithmetic operations in autoregressive architectures.
However, their ability to perform approximate reasoning in informal, fast-paced
mathematical operations has received far less attention, especially among
non-autoregressive decoder models. Our work addresses this gap by introducing
StreetMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate models' approximation abilities
under real-world approximation scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations
across different LLM architectures: Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507,
Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507, Dream-v0-Instruct-7B, Falcon-Mamba-7B-Instruct, and
Mamba-GPT-3B. Furthermore, we apply mechanistic interpretability techniques to
probe their internal computational states. Our analysis reveals that LLMs
generally attempt to compute exact values or invoke external tools even in
tasks that call for approximation. Moreover, while models sometimes reach the
correct answer in early layers or steps, they still consume more tokens when
solving approximation tasks. Additional experiments indicate that exact and
approximate arithmetic operations rely on largely separate neural components.
Drawing upon research on cognitive psychology, we argue that LLMs do not
exhibit cognitive miserliness in the same way humans do in street math
settings. We open source our work https://github.com/ctseng777/StreetMath

### [2] [Review Based Entity Ranking using Fuzzy Logic Algorithmic Approach: Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25778)
*Pratik N. Kalamkar,Anupama G. Phakatkar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a fuzzy logic-based approach for sentiment analysis that classifies opinions into granular strength levels (very weak to very strong) by combining different opinion words related to product aspects, addressing limitations of traditional lexicon-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional holistic lexicon-based sentiment analysis approaches fail to consider the varying strength of opinions, treating all negative or positive opinions equally without distinguishing between very strong, strong, moderate, weak, and very weak sentiments.

Method: The approach uses fuzzy logic to classify opinion words into different strength categories and employs syntactic dependency resolution to identify relationships between opinion words and desired aspect words. It considers various opinion word types (adverbs, adjectives, nouns, verbs) related to specific product aspects.

Result: The proposed method enables ranking entities based on both orientation (positive/negative) and strength of reviews, providing more nuanced sentiment analysis by classifying opinions into five granularity levels.

Conclusion: This fuzzy logic-based approach with granular sentiment classification offers a more sophisticated method for opinion mining that captures the varying intensity of sentiments, improving upon traditional lexicon-based methods that only consider binary positive/negative classifications.

Abstract: Opinion mining, also called sentiment analysis, is the field of study that
analyzes people opinions, sentiments, evaluations, appraisals, attitudes, and
emotions towards entities such as products, services, organizations,
individuals, issues, events, topics, and their attributes. Holistic
lexicon-based approach does not consider the strength of each opinion, i.e.,
whether the opinion is very strongly negative (or positive), strongly negative
(or positive), moderate negative (or positive), very weakly negative (or
positive) and weakly negative (or positive). In this paper, we propose approach
to rank entities based on orientation and strength of the entity reviews and
user's queries by classifying them in granularity levels (i.e. very weak, weak,
moderate, very strong and strong) by combining opinion words (i.e. adverb,
adjective, noun and verb) that are related to aspect of interest of certain
product. We shall use fuzzy logic algorithmic approach in order to classify
opinion words into different category and syntactic dependency resolution to
find relations for desired aspect words. Opinion words related to certain
aspects of interest are considered to find the entity score for that aspect in
the review.

### [3] [LASTIST: LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25783)
*DongJae Kim,Yaejin Lee,Minsu Park,Eunil Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces LASTIST, a large-scale Korean dataset for target-independent stance detection, addressing the lack of resources in low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most stance detection research focuses on English and target-dependent approaches, creating a gap for Korean and target-independent methods.

Method: Collected 563,299 labeled Korean sentences from political party press releases and trained state-of-the-art deep learning models.

Result: Created the LASTIST dataset supporting target-independent and diachronic evolution stance detection tasks.

Conclusion: LASTIST fills a critical research gap for Korean stance detection and enables various stance analysis tasks.

Abstract: Stance detection has emerged as an area of research in the field of
artificial intelligence. However, most research is currently centered on the
target-dependent stance detection task, which is based on a person's stance in
favor of or against a specific target. Furthermore, most benchmark datasets are
based on English, making it difficult to develop models in low-resource
languages such as Korean, especially for an emerging field such as stance
detection. This study proposes the LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance
(LASTIST) dataset to fill this research gap. Collected from the press releases
of both parties on Korean political parties, the LASTIST dataset uses 563,299
labeled Korean sentences. We provide a detailed description of how we collected
and constructed the dataset and trained state-of-the-art deep learning and
stance detection models. Our LASTIST dataset is designed for various tasks in
stance detection, including target-independent stance detection and diachronic
evolution stance detection. We deploy our dataset on
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LASTIST-3721/.

### [4] [zFLoRA: Zero-Latency Fused Low-Rank Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25784)
*Dhananjaya Gowda,Seoha Song,Harshith Goka,Junhyun Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: zFLoRA is a zero-latency fused low-rank adapter that eliminates the inference overhead of traditional adapters while maintaining performance comparable to full fine-tuning and LoRA across 18 tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional task-specific adapters in LLMs, despite having small parameter counts (less than 1% of base model), cause disproportionately significant latency during inference (up to 2.5x base model), creating deployment inefficiencies.

Method: Proposed zFLoRA (zero-latency fused low-rank adapter) that integrates adapter parameters into the base model without adding inference latency overhead, using a fused architecture approach.

Result: zFLoRA achieves performance comparable to supervised fine-tuning benchmarks including LoRA and full fine-tuning across 18 tasks in commonsense reasoning, math reasoning, and summary-dialogue categories. Latency measurements on NPU (Samsung Galaxy S25+) and GPU (NVIDIA H100) show zero to negligible overhead.

Conclusion: zFLoRA successfully addresses the inference latency problem of traditional adapters while maintaining competitive performance, making it suitable for efficient deployment of multi-adapter LLM systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed with task-specific
adapters catering to multiple downstream applications. In such a scenario, the
additional compute associated with these apparently insignificant number of
adapter parameters (typically less than 1% of the base model) turns out to be
disproportionately significant during inference time (upto 2.5x times that of
the base model). In this paper, we propose a new zero-latency fused low-rank
adapter (zFLoRA) that introduces zero or negligible latency overhead on top of
the base model. Experimental results on LLMs of size 1B, 3B and 7B show that
zFLoRA compares favorably against the popular supervised fine-tuning benchmarks
including low-rank adapters (LoRA) as well as full fine-tuning (FFT).
Experiments are conducted on 18 different tasks across three different
categories namely commonsense reasoning, math reasoning and summary-dialogue.
Latency measurements made on NPU (Samsung Galaxy S25+) as well as GPU (NVIDIA
H100) platforms show that the proposed zFLoRA adapters introduce zero to
negligible latency overhead.

### [5] [BlackboxNLP-2025 MIB Shared Task: Improving Circuit Faithfulness via Better Edge Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25786)
*Yaniv Nikankin,Dana Arad,Itay Itzhak,Anja Reusch,Adi Simhi,Gal Kesten-Pomeranz,Yonatan Belinkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes three improvements to circuit discovery in mechanistic interpretability: bootstrapping for consistent attribution scores, ratio-based edge selection, and integer linear programming instead of greedy selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in determining which parts of neural models perform specific tasks by improving circuit discovery methods.

Method: Uses bootstrapping for consistent attribution scores, introduces ratio-based edge selection strategy, and replaces greedy selection with integer linear programming formulation.

Result: The methods produce more faithful circuits and outperform prior approaches across multiple Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark tasks and models.

Conclusion: The proposed improvements to circuit discovery yield better performance and faithfulness compared to existing methods.

Abstract: One of the main challenges in mechanistic interpretability is circuit
discovery, determining which parts of a model perform a given task. We build on
the Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark (MIB) and propose three key
improvements to circuit discovery. First, we use bootstrapping to identify
edges with consistent attribution scores. Second, we introduce a simple
ratio-based selection strategy to prioritize strong positive-scoring edges,
balancing performance and faithfulness. Third, we replace the standard greedy
selection with an integer linear programming formulation. Our methods yield
more faithful circuits and outperform prior approaches across multiple MIB
tasks and models. Our code is available at:

### [6] [LISTEN to Your Preferences: An LLM Framework for Multi-Objective Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25799)
*Adam S. Jovine,Tinghan Ye,Francis Bahk,Jingjing Wang,David B. Shmoys,Peter I. Frazier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LISTEN framework uses LLMs as zero-shot preference oracles to help experts select optimal options from large sets with multiple objectives, using natural language guidance instead of formal preference modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human experts struggle to select best options from large sets with competing objectives due to difficulty formalizing complex implicit preferences, creating process bottlenecks.

Method: Two iterative algorithms: LISTEN-U (refines parametric utility function using LLM) and LISTEN-T (non-parametric tournament-style selections over small batches). Uses LLM as zero-shot preference oracle guided by natural language priorities.

Result: Evaluated on flight booking, shopping, and exam scheduling tasks. LISTEN-U excels when preferences are parametrically aligned, while LISTEN-T offers more robust performance overall.

Conclusion: LISTEN explores promising direction for steering complex multi-objective decisions directly with natural language, reducing cognitive burden of traditional preference elicitation.

Abstract: Human experts often struggle to select the best option from a large set of
items with multiple competing objectives, a process bottlenecked by the
difficulty of formalizing complex, implicit preferences. To address this, we
introduce LISTEN, a framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) as a
zero-shot preference oracle, guided only by an expert's high-level priorities
in natural language. To operate within LLM constraints like context windows and
inference costs, we propose two iterative algorithms: LISTEN-U, which uses the
LLM to refine a parametric utility function, and LISTEN-T, a non-parametric
method that performs tournament-style selections over small batches of
solutions. Evaluated on diverse tasks including flight booking, shopping, and
exam scheduling, our results show LISTEN-U excels when preferences are
parametrically aligned (a property we measure with a novel concordance metric),
while LISTEN-T offers more robust performance. This work explores a promising
direction for steering complex multi-objective decisions directly with natural
language, reducing the cognitive burden of traditional preference elicitation.

### [7] [Beyond Length: Quantifying Long-Range Information for Long-Context LLM Pretraining Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25804)
*Haoran Deng,Yingyu Lin,Zhenghao Lin,Xiao Liu,Yizhou Sun,Yi-An Ma,Yeyun Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongFilter is a framework that selects training data with meaningful long-distance dependencies for long-context language models by measuring information gain from extended context, improving model performance on long-context benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most available long-text data lacks meaningful long-distance dependencies, making training inefficient. Careful data selection is crucial for effective long-context pretraining.

Method: LongFilter measures information gain by contrasting model predictions under long-context vs short-context settings to identify samples where long-range dependencies are essential.

Result: Experiments with LLaMA-3-8B extending context from 8K to 64K show LongFilter efficiently selects high-quality data and yields substantial improvements on HELMET, LongBench, and RULER benchmarks.

Conclusion: LongFilter provides an effective framework for curating training data tailored to long-context pretraining by identifying samples with meaningful long-distance dependencies.

Abstract: Long-context language models unlock advanced capabilities in reasoning, code
generation, and document summarization by leveraging dependencies across
extended spans of text. However, a significant portion of readily available
long-text data lacks meaningful long-distance dependencies; most spans can be
predicted using only local context. Training on such data is inefficient,
making careful data selection crucial. Therefore, we introduce LongFilter, a
framework for curating training data tailored to long-context pretraining.
LongFilter measures the information gain provided by extended context by
contrasting model predictions under long-context versus short-context settings,
thereby identifying samples where long-range dependencies are essential.
Experiments with LLaMA-3-8B, extending its context length from 8K to 64K, show
that LongFilter efficiently selects high-quality data and yields substantial
improvements on benchmarks such as HELMET, LongBench, and RULER.

### [8] [Ideology-Based LLMs for Content Moderation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25805)
*Stefano Civelli,Pietro Bernardelle,Nardiena A. Pratama,Gianluca Demartini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Persona adoption in LLMs introduces subtle ideological biases in harmful content classification, with models showing stronger alignment with personas from the same political ideology and diverging judgments across ideological groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how persona adoption influences the consistency and fairness of harmful content classification across different LLM architectures, model sizes, and content modalities, as LLMs are increasingly used in content moderation systems where fairness and neutrality are essential.

Method: Analyzed persona adoption effects on LLM behavior across different architectures, model sizes, and content modalities (language vs. vision), including agreement analyses and an additional study on politically targeted tasks to examine ideological alignment and judgment patterns.

Result: While headline performance metrics show little impact on overall classification accuracy, personas with different ideological leanings display distinct propensities to label content as harmful. Larger models tend to align more closely with personas from the same political ideology, strengthening within-ideology consistency while widening divergence across ideological groups. Personas behave more coherently within their own ideology and exhibit tendency to defend their perspective while downplaying harmfulness in opposing views.

Conclusion: Persona conditioning can introduce subtle ideological biases into LLM outputs, raising concerns about the use of AI systems that may reinforce partisan perspectives under the guise of neutrality in content moderation applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in content moderation
systems, where ensuring fairness and neutrality is essential. In this study, we
examine how persona adoption influences the consistency and fairness of harmful
content classification across different LLM architectures, model sizes, and
content modalities (language vs. vision). At first glance, headline performance
metrics suggest that personas have little impact on overall classification
accuracy. However, a closer analysis reveals important behavioral shifts.
Personas with different ideological leanings display distinct propensities to
label content as harmful, showing that the lens through which a model "views"
input can subtly shape its judgments. Further agreement analyses highlight that
models, particularly larger ones, tend to align more closely with personas from
the same political ideology, strengthening within-ideology consistency while
widening divergence across ideological groups. To show this effect more
directly, we conducted an additional study on a politically targeted task,
which confirmed that personas not only behave more coherently within their own
ideology but also exhibit a tendency to defend their perspective while
downplaying harmfulness in opposing views. Together, these findings highlight
how persona conditioning can introduce subtle ideological biases into LLM
outputs, raising concerns about the use of AI systems that may reinforce
partisan perspectives under the guise of neutrality.

### [9] [Beyond Long Context: When Semantics Matter More than Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25816)
*Tarun Kumar Chawdhury,Jon D. Duke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLEAR method uses entity-aware retrieval for clinical question answering, achieving better performance (F1=0.90) than embedding-based methods while using 70% fewer tokens, with particularly strong results on long clinical documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Electronic Health Records store clinical documentation as encoded attachments, making semantic question answering difficult. Traditional vector database methods often miss nuanced clinical relationships.

Method: Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR) method using entity-aware retrieval, validated against zero-shot large context inference and traditional chunk-based retrieval augmented generation on a Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform with 12 clinical notes ranging from 10,000-65,000 tokens.

Result: CLEAR achieved 58.3% win rate, average semantic similarity of 0.878, used 78% fewer tokens than wide context processing, with 75% win rate for documents exceeding 65,000 tokens. F1 score of 0.90 vs 0.86 for embedding-based retrieval.

Conclusion: Entity-aware retrieval improves both efficiency and accuracy in clinical NLP. The evaluation framework provides a reusable benchmark for assessing clinical QA systems where semantic precision and computational efficiency are critical.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) store clinical documentation as base64
encoded attachments in FHIR DocumentReference resources, which makes semantic
question answering difficult. Traditional vector database methods often miss
nuanced clinical relationships. The Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR)
method, introduced by Lopez et al. 2025, uses entity aware retrieval and
achieved improved performance with an F1 score of 0.90 versus 0.86 for
embedding based retrieval, while using over 70 percent fewer tokens. We
developed a Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform to validate CLEAR against
zero shot large context inference and traditional chunk based retrieval
augmented generation. The platform was tested on 12 clinical notes ranging from
10,000 to 65,000 tokens representing realistic EHR content. CLEAR achieved a
58.3 percent win rate, an average semantic similarity of 0.878, and used 78
percent fewer tokens than wide context processing. The largest performance
gains occurred on long notes, with a 75 percent win rate for documents
exceeding 65,000 tokens. These findings confirm that entity aware retrieval
improves both efficiency and accuracy in clinical natural language processing.
The evaluation framework provides a reusable and transparent benchmark for
assessing clinical question answering systems where semantic precision and
computational efficiency are critical.

### [10] [A Survey on Efficient Large Language Model Training: From Data-centric Perspectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25817)
*Junyu Luo,Bohan Wu,Xiao Luo,Zhiping Xiao,Yiqiao Jin,Rong-Cheng Tu,Nan Yin,Yifan Wang,Jingyang Yuan,Wei Ju,Ming Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a systematic survey of data-efficient post-training methods for Large Language Models from a data-centric perspective, proposing a taxonomy covering data selection, quality enhancement, synthetic data generation, data distillation, and self-evolving data ecosystems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM post-training faces significant data challenges including high annotation costs and diminishing returns on data scale, making data-efficient post-training a crucial research question.

Method: The authors conduct a systematic survey proposing a taxonomy of data-efficient LLM post-training methods, categorizing approaches into data selection, data quality enhancement, synthetic data generation, data distillation and compression, and self-evolving data ecosystems.

Result: The survey summarizes representative approaches in each category and outlines future research directions, providing a comprehensive overview of the current state of data-efficient LLM post-training.

Conclusion: The paper highlights open problems and proposes potential research avenues, aiming to inspire further exploration into maximizing data utilization in large-scale model training.

Abstract: Post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for unlocking their
task generalization potential and domain-specific capabilities. However, the
current LLM post-training paradigm faces significant data challenges, including
the high costs of manual annotation and diminishing marginal returns on data
scales. Therefore, achieving data-efficient post-training has become a key
research question. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey of
data-efficient LLM post-training from a data-centric perspective. We propose a
taxonomy of data-efficient LLM post-training methods, covering data selection,
data quality enhancement, synthetic data generation, data distillation and
compression, and self-evolving data ecosystems. We summarize representative
approaches in each category and outline future research directions. By
examining the challenges in data-efficient LLM post-training, we highlight open
problems and propose potential research avenues. We hope our work inspires
further exploration into maximizing the potential of data utilization in
large-scale model training. Paper List:

### [11] [Evaluating the Impact of LLM-Assisted Annotation in a Perspectivized Setting: the Case of FrameNet Annotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25904)
*Frederico Belcavello,Ely Matos,Arthur Lorenzi,Lisandra Bonoto,Lívia Ruiz,Luiz Fernando Pereira,Victor Herbst,Yulla Navarro,Helen de Andrade Abreu,Lívia Dutra,Tiago Timponi Torrent*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates LLM-based semantic role labeling for FrameNet annotation, comparing manual, automatic, and semi-automatic approaches across time, coverage, and diversity metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive evaluation of LLM tools for creating annotated datasets, particularly from a perspectivized NLP approach, despite their growing use in linguistic research.

Method: Comparative evaluation of three annotation settings: manual, automatic (LLM-only), and semi-automatic (hybrid human-LLM) approaches for FrameNet-like semantic annotation, measuring annotation time, coverage, and diversity.

Result: Semi-automatic annotation achieved increased frame diversity and similar coverage compared to manual annotation, while automatic annotation performed worse in all metrics except annotation time.

Conclusion: Hybrid semi-automatic annotation using LLMs shows promise for improving frame diversity while maintaining coverage, though fully automatic approaches remain insufficient for quality semantic annotation.

Abstract: The use of LLM-based applications as a means to accelerate and/or substitute
human labor in the creation of language resources and dataset is a reality.
Nonetheless, despite the potential of such tools for linguistic research,
comprehensive evaluation of their performance and impact on the creation of
annotated datasets, especially under a perspectivized approach to NLP, is still
missing. This paper contributes to reduction of this gap by reporting on an
extensive evaluation of the (semi-)automatization of FrameNet-like semantic
annotation by the use of an LLM-based semantic role labeler. The methodology
employed compares annotation time, coverage and diversity in three experimental
settings: manual, automatic and semi-automatic annotation. Results show that
the hybrid, semi-automatic annotation setting leads to increased frame
diversity and similar annotation coverage, when compared to the human-only
setting, while the automatic setting performs considerably worse in all
metrics, except for annotation time.

### [12] [RECAP: Reproducing Copyrighted Data from LLMs Training with an Agentic Pipeline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25941)
*André V. Duarte,Xuying li,Bin Zeng,Arlindo L. Oliveira,Lei Li,Zhuo Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RECAP is an agentic pipeline that uses feedback loops and jailbreaking to extract memorized training data from LLMs, achieving 24% improvement in extracting copyrighted text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To verify what training data LLMs have seen when direct inspection is impossible, by eliciting memorized content through model outputs.

Method: Feedback-driven loop with secondary model evaluation, discrepancy identification, correction hints, and jailbreaking module to overcome alignment refusals.

Result: On EchoTrace benchmark (30+ books), RECAP improved average ROUGE-L score from 0.38 to 0.47 (24% increase) for GPT-4.1.

Conclusion: RECAP effectively extracts memorized training data from LLMs through iterative refinement and jailbreaking, providing evidence of training data exposure.

Abstract: If we cannot inspect the training data of a large language model (LLM), how
can we ever know what it has seen? We believe the most compelling evidence
arises when the model itself freely reproduces the target content. As such, we
propose RECAP, an agentic pipeline designed to elicit and verify memorized
training data from LLM outputs. At the heart of RECAP is a feedback-driven
loop, where an initial extraction attempt is evaluated by a secondary language
model, which compares the output against a reference passage and identifies
discrepancies. These are then translated into minimal correction hints, which
are fed back into the target model to guide subsequent generations. In
addition, to address alignment-induced refusals, RECAP includes a jailbreaking
module that detects and overcomes such barriers. We evaluate RECAP on
EchoTrace, a new benchmark spanning over 30 full books, and the results show
that RECAP leads to substantial gains over single-iteration approaches. For
instance, with GPT-4.1, the average ROUGE-L score for the copyrighted text
extraction improved from 0.38 to 0.47 - a nearly 24% increase.

### [13] [Revisiting Multilingual Data Mixtures in Language Model Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25947)
*Negar Foroutan,Paul Teiletche,Ayush Kumar Tarun,Antoine Bosselut*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study challenges common assumptions about multilingual LLM training, finding that combining English and multilingual data doesn't degrade performance when languages have sufficient tokens, English serves as an effective pivot language across families, and no significant 'curse of multilinguality' exists at 1.1B-3B parameter scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the impact of different multilingual data mixtures in pretraining LLMs and address ongoing debates about potential trade-offs between language coverage and model performance, particularly the 'curse of multilinguality' concern.

Method: Training 1.1B and 3B parameter LLMs on diverse multilingual corpora, varying the number of languages from 25 to 400, and analyzing the effects of different language mixtures and pivot language strategies.

Result: Combining English and multilingual data doesn't degrade in-language performance when languages have sufficient tokens; English as pivot language benefits all language families; no significant curse of multilinguality observed at this scale.

Conclusion: Multilingual data, when balanced appropriately, can enhance language model capabilities without compromising performance, even in low-resource settings, challenging common beliefs about multilingual training trade-offs.

Abstract: The impact of different multilingual data mixtures in pretraining large
language models (LLMs) has been a topic of ongoing debate, often raising
concerns about potential trade-offs between language coverage and model
performance (i.e., the curse of multilinguality). In this work, we investigate
these assumptions by training 1.1B and 3B parameter LLMs on diverse
multilingual corpora, varying the number of languages from 25 to 400. Our study
challenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training. First, we find
that combining English and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the
in-language performance of either group, provided that languages have a
sufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus. Second, we
observe that using English as a pivot language (i.e., a high-resource language
that serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization) yields benefits
across language families, and contrary to expectations, selecting a pivot
language from within a specific family does not consistently improve
performance for languages within that family. Lastly, we do not observe a
significant "curse of multilinguality" as the number of training languages
increases in models at this scale. Our findings suggest that multilingual data,
when balanced appropriately, can enhance language model capabilities without
compromising performance, even in low-resource settings

### [14] [Semantic Label Drift in Cross-Cultural Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25967)
*Mohsinul Kabir,Tasnim Ahmed,Md Mezbaur Rahman,Polydoros Giannouris,Sophia Ananiadou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MT systems, including LLMs, cause label drift during translation due to cultural divergence between languages, especially in culturally sensitive domains. Cultural similarity between source and target languages is crucial for label preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the underexplored role of cultural alignment in machine translation and how cultural divergence affects semantic label preservation during translation.

Method: Conducted experiments across culturally sensitive and neutral domains using various MT systems including modern LLMs, analyzing label drift during translation and the impact of cultural knowledge encoding.

Result: Found that MT systems induce label drift, LLMs encode cultural knowledge that amplifies drift, and cultural similarity between languages is a key determinant of label preservation.

Conclusion: Neglecting cultural factors in MT undermines label fidelity and risks misinterpretation and cultural conflict in downstream applications.

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) is widely employed to address resource scarcity in
low-resource languages by generating synthetic data from high-resource
counterparts. While sentiment preservation in translation has long been
studied, a critical but underexplored factor is the role of cultural alignment
between source and target languages. In this paper, we hypothesize that
semantic labels are drifted or altered during MT due to cultural divergence.
Through a series of experiments across culturally sensitive and neutral
domains, we establish three key findings: (1) MT systems, including modern
Large Language Models (LLMs), induce label drift during translation,
particularly in culturally sensitive domains; (2) unlike earlier statistical MT
tools, LLMs encode cultural knowledge, and leveraging this knowledge can
amplify label drift; and (3) cultural similarity or dissimilarity between
source and target languages is a crucial determinant of label preservation. Our
findings highlight that neglecting cultural factors in MT not only undermines
label fidelity but also risks misinterpretation and cultural conflict in
downstream applications.

### [15] [SymCode: A Neurosymbolic Approach to Mathematical Reasoning via Verifiable Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25975)
*Sina Bagheri Nezhad,Yao Li,Ameeta Agrawal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SymCode is a neurosymbolic framework that improves mathematical reasoning in LLMs by generating verifiable code using SymPy, achieving up to 13.6% accuracy gains over baselines while making errors more transparent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with complex mathematical reasoning, producing unverified and arithmetically unsound solutions through prose-based generation. Current methods like Chain of Thought lack deterministic verification mechanisms.

Method: Reframes mathematical problem-solving as verifiable code generation using the SymPy library, creating a neurosymbolic framework that grounds LLM reasoning in a deterministic symbolic engine.

Result: Achieved significant accuracy improvements of up to 13.6 percentage points over baselines on challenging benchmarks (MATH-500 and OlympiadBench), with better token efficiency and more transparent error patterns.

Conclusion: SymCode represents a key step towards more accurate and trustworthy AI in formal domains by shifting model failures from opaque logical fallacies to transparent programmatic errors through symbolic grounding.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning, where prose-based generation leads to unverified and arithmetically
unsound solutions. Current prompting strategies like Chain of Thought still
operate within this unreliable medium, lacking a mechanism for deterministic
verification. To address these limitations, we introduce SymCode, a
neurosymbolic framework that reframes mathematical problem-solving as a task of
verifiable code generation using the SymPy library. We evaluate SymCode on
challenging benchmarks, including MATH-500 and OlympiadBench, demonstrating
significant accuracy improvements of up to 13.6 percentage points over
baselines. Our analysis shows that SymCode is not only more token-efficient but
also fundamentally shifts model failures from opaque logical fallacies towards
transparent, programmatic errors. By grounding LLM reasoning in a deterministic
symbolic engine, SymCode represents a key step towards more accurate and
trustworthy AI in formal domains.

### [16] [NeuronMM: High-Performance Matrix Multiplication for LLM Inference on AWS Trainium](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25977)
*Dinghong Song,Jierui Xu,Weichu Yang,Pengfei Su,Dong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents high-performance matrix multiplication optimizations for LLM inference on AWS Trainium AI accelerators, achieving significant speedups through kernel fusion and novel caching strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AWS Trainium AI accelerators provide cost-effective solutions for LLM training and inference, but achieving high performance is challenging due to its systolic array architecture and special data layout requirements.

Method: The authors designed a series of techniques customized to Trainium including kernel fusion and novel caching strategies to reduce data movement across the software-managed memory hierarchy, maximize SRAM bandwidth, and avoid expensive matrix transpose operations.

Result: Evaluation with nine datasets and four recent LLMs showed that their system outperforms AWS's state-of-the-art matmul implementation: achieving an average 1.35x speedup (up to 2.22x) at the matmul kernel level, and an average 1.66x speedup (up to 2.49x) for end-to-end LLM inference.

Conclusion: The proposed optimizations successfully address the performance challenges of Trainium architecture and demonstrate significant improvements in matrix multiplication performance for LLM inference workloads.

Abstract: AI accelerators, customized to AI workloads, provide cost-effective and
high-performance solutions for training and inference. Trainium, an AI
accelerator recently developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS), provides an
attractive option for LLM training and inference through its heterogeneous
architecture. However, leveraging Trainium architecture for high performance
can be challenging because of its systolic array architecture and special
requirement on data layout. In this paper, we design high-performance matrix
multiplication (matmul), a critical compute kernel, for LLM inference on
Trainium. We introduce a series of techniques customized to Trainium based on
kernel fusion and novel caching strategies to reduce data movement across the
software-managed memory hierarchy, maximize SRAM bandwidth, and avoid expensive
matrix transpose. Evaluating with nine datasets and four recent LLMs, we show
that our system largely outperforms the state-of-the-art matmul implemented by
AWS on Trainium: at the level of matmul kernel, it achieves an average 1.35x
speedup (up to 2.22x), which translates to an average 1.66x speedup (up to
2.49x) for end-to-end LLM inference.

*Dinghong Song,Yuan Feng,Yiwei Wang,Shangye Chen,Cyril Guyot,Filip Blagojevic,Hyeran Jeon,Pengfei Su,Dong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AttnCache accelerates LLM prefill inference by caching and reusing similar attention maps, achieving 1.2-1.6x end-to-end speedup with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many real-world workloads rely only on prefill stage where self-attention's quadratic complexity becomes the bottleneck, and similar sentences often produce similar attention maps.

Method: Proposes AttnCache framework with attention map memorization database that uses caching and similarity search to retrieve and reuse similar attention maps during inference.

Result: Achieves average 1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x attention speedup on GPU with negligible accuracy degradation.

Conclusion: AttnCache effectively accelerates prefill-only LLM inference by exploiting attention map similarity, providing significant computational savings while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in generative applications such
as chatting, code generation, and reasoning. However, many realworld workloads
such as classification, question answering, recommendation, and text embedding
rely solely on the prefill stage of inference, where the model encodes input
sequences without performing autoregressive decoding. In these prefill only
scenarios, the self-attention computation becomes the primary performance
bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. In
this paper, we observe that semantically different sentences often produce
similar attention maps across layers and heads. Building on this insight, we
propose AttnCache, a framework that accelerates the prefill stage of LLM
inference by retrieving and reusing similar attention maps. Based on an
attention map memorization database, AttnCache employs efficient caching and
similarity search techniques to identify and reuse pre-cached attention maps
during inference, thereby reducing the computational overhead of
self-attention. Experimental results show that AttnCache achieves an average of
1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x
attention speedup on GPU, with negligible accuracy degradation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SRL is a new training framework that combines supervised learning with reinforcement learning to improve multi-step reasoning in small LLMs by generating logical action sequences with internal reasoning monologues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with multi-step reasoning tasks. Small models fail with RLVR when correct solutions are rarely sampled, while SFT overfits through rigid imitation of demonstrations.

Method: SRL reformulates problem solving as generating sequences of logical actions. It trains models to produce internal reasoning monologues before each action, providing step-wise rewards based on similarity to expert actions from SFT data.

Result: SRL enables small models to learn challenging problems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Combining SRL initialization with RLVR refinement yields the strongest performance. SRL also generalizes well to agentic software engineering tasks.

Conclusion: SRL is a robust and versatile training framework that provides richer learning signals for reasoning-oriented LLMs, bridging the gap between supervised and reinforcement learning approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with problems that require
multi-step reasoning. For small-scale open-source models, Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) fails when correct solutions are rarely
sampled even after many attempts, while Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to
overfit long demonstrations through rigid token-by-token imitation. To address
this gap, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework that
reformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical "actions". SRL
trains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing
to each action. It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between
the model's actions and expert actions extracted from the SFT dataset in a
step-wise manner. This supervision offers richer learning signals even when all
rollouts are incorrect, while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert
demonstrations. As a result, SRL enables small models to learn challenging
problems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training
with SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance.
Beyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software
engineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework
for reasoning-oriented LLMs.

*Feijie Wu,Weiwu Zhu,Yuxiang Zhang,Soumya Chatterjee,Jiarong Zhu,Fan Mo,Rodin Luo,Jing Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PORTool is a reinforcement learning method that trains tool-use LLMs to explore multiple solution trajectories in dynamic tool environments, improving performance through step-wise rewards and fork-relative advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tool-use LLMs trained on static datasets fail to explore possible solutions and perform poorly in dynamic tool-call environments, as they only imitate generic tool-call routines without considering alternative trajectories.

Method: PORTool generates multiple rollouts for queries forming tree-like structures, assigns step-wise rewards based on correct answers and successful tool calls, and uses fork-relative advantages blended with trajectory-relative advantages to train the LLM.

Result: Experiments with 17 tools covering time-sensitive and time-invariant topics show significant improvements in final accuracy and reduction in tool-call steps compared to other training approaches.

Conclusion: PORTool effectively enhances tool-use LLMs' performance in dynamic environments by encouraging exploration of multiple solution trajectories through reinforcement learning with step-wise rewards.

Abstract: Current tool-use large language models (LLMs) are trained on static datasets,
enabling them to interact with external tools and perform multi-step,
tool-integrated reasoning, which produces tool-call trajectories. However,
these models imitate how a query is resolved in a generic tool-call routine,
thereby failing to explore possible solutions and demonstrating limited
performance in an evolved, dynamic tool-call environment. In this work, we
propose PORTool, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that encourages a
tool-use LLM to explore various trajectories yielding the correct answer.
Specifically, this method starts with generating multiple rollouts for a given
query, and some of them share the first few tool-call steps, thereby forming a
tree-like structure. Next, we assign rewards to each step, based on its ability
to produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls. A shared step
across different trajectories receives the same reward, while different steps
under the same fork receive different rewards. Finally, these step-wise rewards
are used to calculate fork-relative advantages, blended with
trajectory-relative advantages, to train the LLM for tool use. The experiments
utilize 17 tools to address user queries, covering both time-sensitive and
time-invariant topics. We conduct ablation studies to systematically justify
the necessity and the design robustness of step-wise rewards. Furthermore, we
compare the proposed PORTool with other training approaches and demonstrate
significant improvements in final accuracy and the number of tool-call steps.

### [20] [Rethinking Cross-lingual Alignment: Balancing Transfer and Cultural Erasure in Multilingual LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26024)
*HyoJung Han,Sweta Agrawal,Eleftheria Briakou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cross-lingual alignment in LLMs improves knowledge transfer but causes cultural erasure. The paper introduces a framework to measure this trade-off, finds CLA methods consistently sacrifice cultural localization for factual transfer, and proposes Surgical Steering to balance both objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between cross-lingual knowledge transfer and cultural erasure in multilingual LLMs, where current alignment techniques improve factual transfer but eliminate culturally-situated responses.

Method: Introduces a transfer-localization plane evaluation framework, analyzes CLA approaches across six languages, investigates internal model representations, and proposes Surgical Steering - an inference-time method using targeted activation steering at different layers.

Result: CLA methods consistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural localization across all languages studied. Universal factual transfer and culturally-specific knowledge are optimally steerable at different model layers.

Conclusion: Surgical Steering effectively disentangles factual transfer from cultural knowledge by applying targeted activation steering to distinct layers, achieving better balance between competing objectives and overcoming limitations of current alignment techniques.

Abstract: Cross-lingual alignment (CLA) aims to align multilingual representations,
enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to seamlessly transfer knowledge across
languages. While intuitive, we hypothesize, this pursuit of representational
convergence can inadvertently cause "cultural erasure", the functional loss of
providing culturally-situated responses that should diverge based on the query
language. In this work, we systematically analyze this trade-off by introducing
a holistic evaluation framework, the transfer-localization plane, which
quantifies both desirable knowledge transfer and undesirable cultural erasure.
Using this framework, we re-evaluate recent CLA approaches and find that they
consistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural
localization across all six languages studied. Our investigation into the
internal representations of these models reveals a key insight: universal
factual transfer and culturally-specific knowledge are optimally steerable at
different model layers. Based on this finding, we propose Surgical Steering, a
novel inference-time method that disentangles these two objectives. By applying
targeted activation steering to distinct layers, our approach achieves a better
balance between the two competing dimensions, effectively overcoming the
limitations of current alignment techniques.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study developed an NLP pipeline to analyze incidental thyroid findings (ITFs) in radiology reports, finding that 7.8% of patients had ITFs which were strongly associated with increased thyroid cancer diagnosis, suggesting ITFs contribute to thyroid cancer overdiagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incidental thyroid findings are increasingly detected on imaging but their prevalence, features, and clinical consequences remain undefined, creating a need for systematic analysis of their impact.

Method: Retrospective cohort study using a transformer-based NLP pipeline to identify ITFs and extract nodule characteristics from radiology reports of 115,683 patients without prior thyroid disease from July 2017 to September 2023.

Result: 7.8% of patients had ITFs (92.9% were nodules), with higher likelihood in women, older adults, higher BMI, and specific imaging types. ITFs were associated with significantly higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer diagnosis.

Conclusion: ITFs are common and strongly associated with diagnostic cascades leading to detection of small, low-risk cancers, highlighting their role in thyroid cancer overdiagnosis and the need for standardized reporting and selective follow-up.

Abstract: Importance Incidental thyroid findings (ITFs) are increasingly detected on
imaging performed for non-thyroid indications. Their prevalence, features, and
clinical consequences remain undefined. Objective To develop, validate, and
deploy a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to identify ITFs in
radiology reports and assess their prevalence, features, and clinical outcomes.
Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort of adults without prior
thyroid disease undergoing thyroid-capturing imaging at Mayo Clinic sites from
July 1, 2017, to September 30, 2023. A transformer-based NLP pipeline
identified ITFs and extracted nodule characteristics from image reports from
multiple modalities and body regions. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of
ITFs, downstream thyroid ultrasound, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer
diagnosis. Logistic regression identified demographic and imaging-related
factors. Results Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9%
women), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules. ITFs were more
likely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was
ordered by oncology or internal medicine. Compared with chest CT, ITFs were
more likely via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans. Nodule
characteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in 44% and other
features in fewer than 15% (e.g. calcifications). Compared with patients
without ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis,
biopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were
papillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF. Conclusions ITFs were
common and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small,
low-risk cancers. These findings underscore the role of ITFs in thyroid cancer
overdiagnosis and the need for standardized reporting and more selective
follow-up.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QCoder Benchmark is an evaluation framework that assesses LLMs on quantum programming using simulated hardware feedback and human-written code comparisons, showing advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only 18.97% accuracy while reasoning-based models reach 78%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in evaluating LLMs for quantum programming domains that require interaction with hardware devices, which remains underexplored compared to general code generation tasks.

Method: Introduces QCoder Benchmark with two key features: quantum simulator environment for domain-specific metrics feedback (circuit depth, execution time, error classification), and human-written code submissions from real programming contests for quantitative and qualitative comparisons.

Result: Experiments show GPT-4o achieves only 18.97% accuracy, while reasoning-based models like o3 reach 78% accuracy, outperforming human-written code average success rates of 39.98%.

Conclusion: The benchmark highlights the difficulty of quantum programming for LLMs and demonstrates the effectiveness of reasoning-based approaches, with released dataset and public API to support further research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been applied to automatic
programming code generation. This task can be viewed as a language generation
task that bridges natural language, human knowledge, and programming logic.
However, it remains underexplored in domains that require interaction with
hardware devices, such as quantum programming, where human coders write Python
code that is executed on a quantum computer. To address this gap, we introduce
QCoder Benchmark, an evaluation framework that assesses LLMs on quantum
programming with feedback from simulated hardware devices. Our benchmark offers
two key features. First, it supports evaluation using a quantum simulator
environment beyond conventional Python execution, allowing feedback of
domain-specific metrics such as circuit depth, execution time, and error
classification, which can be used to guide better generation. Second, it
incorporates human-written code submissions collected from real programming
contests, enabling both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analyses of
LLM outputs against human-written codes. Our experiments reveal that even
advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only around 18.97% accuracy, highlighting
the difficulty of the benchmark. In contrast, reasoning-based models such as o3
reach up to 78% accuracy, outperforming averaged success rates of human-written
codes (39.98%). We release the QCoder Benchmark dataset and public evaluation
API to support further research.

*Feng Ju,Zeyu Qin,Rui Min,Zhitao He,Lingpeng Kong,Yi R. Fung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a "one problem, multiple solutions" (1PNS) training paradigm to address low diversity in LLM outputs caused by traditional "one problem, one solution" training. It introduces Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD) to measure semantic differences between reasoning paths and uses it to curate diverse training sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional "one problem, one solution" training pushes models toward narrow reasoning paths, limiting output diversity and becoming a bottleneck for Test-Time Scaling effectiveness.

Method: Developed Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD) metric to measure semantic differences in multi-step reasoning chains, curated maximally diverse solution sets using RPD, and fine-tuned Qwen3-4B-Base model with 1PNS training paradigm.

Result: RPD-selected training yields more varied outputs and higher pass@k, with +2.80% average gain in pass@16 over 1P1S baseline and +4.99% gain on AIME24 benchmark.

Conclusion: The 1PNS paradigm with RPD metric successfully increases reasoning diversity and amplifies the effectiveness of Test-Time Scaling in LLMs.

Abstract: While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs), low diversity in model outputs often
becomes a bottleneck; this is partly caused by the common "one problem, one
solution" (1P1S) training practice, which provides a single canonical answer
and can push models toward a narrow set of reasoning paths. To address this, we
propose a "one problem, multiple solutions" (1PNS) training paradigm that
exposes the model to a variety of valid reasoning trajectories and thus
increases inference diversity. A core challenge for 1PNS is reliably measuring
semantic differences between multi-step chains of thought, so we introduce
Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD), a step-level metric that aligns and scores
Long Chain-of-Thought solutions to capture differences in intermediate
reasoning. Using RPD, we curate maximally diverse solution sets per problem and
fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Base. Experiments show that RPD-selected training yields
more varied outputs and higher pass@k, with an average +2.80% gain in pass@16
over a strong 1P1S baseline and a +4.99% gain on AIME24, demonstrating that
1PNS further amplifies the effectiveness of TTS. Our code is available at

*Nawar Turk,Sevag Kaspar,Leila Kosseim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study analyzes how persuasion techniques relate to discourse relations using LLMs, creating silver datasets that reveal six key discourse relations are crucial in persuasive texts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the relationship between persuasion techniques and discourse relations, as no existing dataset contains both annotations, which could help detect online propaganda and misinformation.

Method: Used SemEval 2023 Task 3 dataset with 19 PTs, developed LLM-based classifiers with 4 LLMs and 10 prompts to label discourse relations, created ensemble models with majority-pooling strategies to generate 5 silver datasets.

Result: Created silver datasets (1281-204 instances) showing six discourse relations (Cause, Purpose, Contrast, Cause+Belief, Concession, Condition) are crucial in persuasive texts, especially for Loaded Language, Exaggeration/Minimisation, Repetition, and Doubt techniques.

Conclusion: The identified discourse relations play vital roles in persuasion, contributing to detecting online propaganda and understanding effective communication.

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between Persuasion Techniques (PTs)
and Discourse Relations (DRs) by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and
prompt engineering. Since no dataset annotated with both PTs and DRs exists, we
took the SemEval 2023 Task 3 dataset labelled with 19 PTs as a starting point
and developed LLM-based classifiers to label each instance of the dataset with
one of the 22 PDTB 3.0 level-2 DRs. In total, four LLMs were evaluated using 10
different prompts, resulting in 40 unique DR classifiers. Ensemble models using
different majority-pooling strategies were used to create 5 silver datasets of
instances labelled with both persuasion techniques and level-2 PDTB senses. The
silver dataset sizes vary from 1,281 instances to 204 instances, depending on
the majority pooling technique used. Statistical analysis of these silver
datasets shows that six discourse relations (namely Cause, Purpose, Contrast,
Cause+Belief, Concession, and Condition) play a crucial role in persuasive
texts, especially in the use of Loaded Language, Exaggeration/Minimisation,
Repetition and to cast Doubt. This insight can contribute to detecting online
propaganda and misinformation, as well as to our general understanding of
effective communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create language models that maximize the proportion of generations in well-calibrated, high-probability regions for better instruction-following capability.

Method: Convert existing pre-trained decoder-only Transformer LMs into SDM LMs via supervised fine-tuning using a final-layer SDM activation layer, contrastive input encoding, and online hard negative example generation.

Result: SDM LMs achieve reduced abstentions and improved statistical efficiency compared to strong supervised baselines.

Conclusion: Existing pre-trained language models can be effectively converted into SDM models through the proposed fine-tuning approach, resulting in enhanced instruction-following performance with better statistical properties.

Abstract: We introduce Similarity-Distance-Magnitude (SDM) language models (LMs), which
are sequence prediction models fine-tuned to maximize the proportion of
generations in the well-calibrated, high-probability region partitioned by a
final-layer SDM activation layer used for binary classification of
instruction-following. We demonstrate that existing pre-trained decoder-only
Transformer LMs can be readily converted into SDM LMs via supervised
fine-tuning, using the final-layer SDM activation layer during training to
estimate a change-of-base for a supervised next-token loss over a contrastive
input encoding scheme, with additional hard negative examples generated online
during training. This results in reduced abstentions (i.e., improved
statistical efficiency) compared to strong supervised baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RCScore is a multi-dimensional framework that quantifies how instruction formulation affects LLM responses, revealing performance variations undetected by conventional metrics. It shows instruction style can shift accuracy by up to 16.7% and introduces Cross-Response Similarity to measure stylistic self-consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluations often rely on single instruction templates, overlooking models' sensitivity to instruction style, which is critical for real-world deployments where instructions vary widely.

Method: Systematically transforming benchmark problems into multiple instruction styles and introducing Cross-Response Similarity (CRS) to measure stylistic self-consistency across different instruction formulations.

Result: Experiments across ten LLMs on four reasoning benchmarks show instruction style can shift accuracy by up to 16.7 percentage points. CRS strongly correlates with task accuracy, deterministic decoding produces more stylistically stable outputs, and model scale correlates positively with cross-style consistency.

Conclusion: RCScore provides a principled approach to assess instruction robustness, revealing that instruction style significantly impacts model performance and that stylistic consistency serves as a valuable proxy for model reliability.

Abstract: Current LLM evaluations often rely on a single instruction template,

reliability. Additional findings show that deterministic decoding produces more

### [27] [Don't Let It Fade: Preserving Edits in Diffusion Language Models via Token Timestep Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26200)
*Woojin Kim,Jaeyoung Do*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies 'update forgetting' as a key failure mode in diffusion language models where uniform updates erase earlier semantic edits, and proposes Token Timestep Allocation (TTA) to address this by assigning different timestep schedules to tokens based on their importance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion language models suffer from practical controllability issues due to update forgetting - uniform updates cause token-level fluctuations that erase semantic edits and disrupt refinement, degrading fluency and coherence.

Method: Proposes Token Timestep Allocation (TTA) which implements soft semantic token ordering through per-token timestep schedules. Critical tokens are frozen early while uncertain tokens continue refinement. Can be implemented as fixed or adaptive policies and operates purely at inference time.

Result: TTA significantly improves controllability and fluency: 20% higher accuracy on sentiment control with nearly halved perplexity using <20% steps; in detoxification, lowers maximum toxicity (12.2 vs 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 vs 32.0).

Conclusion: Softened ordering via timestep allocation is critical for mitigating update forgetting and achieving stable, controllable diffusion text generation, with TTA being universally applicable across DLMs and supervision sources.

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their
practical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally
characterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform
and context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,
erasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement
process, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in
uniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token
ordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and
semantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are
frozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This
timestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an
adaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of
refinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies
uniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision
sources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment
control, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves
perplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers
maximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).
Together, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep
allocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving
stable and controllable diffusion text generation.

*Qi Luo,Xiaonan Li,Tingshuo Fan,Xinchi Chen,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GlobalQA is the first benchmark for evaluating global RAG capabilities, addressing the limitation of current benchmarks that only test local RAG. The proposed GlobalRAG framework significantly outperforms existing methods on global tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG evaluation benchmarks focus on local RAG (retrieving relevant chunks from small document subsets), but real-world applications often require global RAG capabilities that involve aggregating information across entire document collections to derive corpus-level insights.

Method: Proposed GlobalRAG framework with three key components: chunk-level retrieval to preserve structural coherence, LLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and aggregation modules for precise symbolic computation.

Result: Existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks (strongest baseline achieves only 1.51 F1). GlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 on Qwen2.5-14B model, representing a significant improvement over the baseline.

Conclusion: GlobalRAG effectively addresses the challenges of global RAG tasks and demonstrates substantial performance gains, validating the need for specialized approaches beyond traditional local RAG methods.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a leading approach to
reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Current RAG evaluation
benchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant
chunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only
localized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world
applications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --
which involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document
collections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, "What are the top 10
most cited papers in 2023?"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering
four core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k
extraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and
baselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks,
with the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these
challenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that
preserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates
LLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates
aggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model,
GlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1,
validating the effectiveness of our method.

### [29] [Pragmatic Theories Enhance Understanding of Implied Meanings in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26253)
*Takuma Sato,Seiya Kawano,Koichiro Yoshino*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Using pragmatic theories like Gricean pragmatics and Relevance Theory as prompts improves language models' performance on understanding implied meanings by up to 9.6% compared to standard reasoning prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models need to understand implied meanings for effective communication, similar to human language use. Current models may lack this pragmatic reasoning capability.

Method: Presenting pragmatic theories as prompts to guide language models through step-by-step reasoning processes for interpreting implied meanings.

Result: Models achieved up to 9.6% higher scores on pragmatic reasoning tasks compared to baseline (0-shot Chain-of-Thought). Even just mentioning theory names improved performance by 1-3% in larger models.

Conclusion: Providing pragmatic theories as prompts is an effective in-context learning approach that significantly enhances language models' ability to understand implied meanings.

Abstract: The ability to accurately interpret implied meanings plays a crucial role in
human communication and language use, and language models are also expected to
possess this capability. This study demonstrates that providing language models
with pragmatic theories as prompts is an effective in-context learning approach
for tasks to understand implied meanings. Specifically, we propose an approach
in which an overview of pragmatic theories, such as Gricean pragmatics and
Relevance Theory, is presented as a prompt to the language model, guiding it
through a step-by-step reasoning process to derive a final interpretation.
Experimental results showed that, compared to the baseline, which prompts
intermediate reasoning without presenting pragmatic theories (0-shot
Chain-of-Thought), our methods enabled language models to achieve up to 9.6\%
higher scores on pragmatic reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we show that even
without explaining the details of pragmatic theories, merely mentioning their
names in the prompt leads to a certain performance improvement (around 1-3%) in
larger models compared to the baseline.

*Mérilin Sousa Silva,Sina Ahmadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether pretrained language models can identify loanwords in minority languages, finding they perform poorly despite contextual information and exhibit bias toward loanwords over native vocabulary.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if language models can differentiate loanwords from native vocabulary in bilingual communities where dominant languages impose lexical items on minority languages, which has implications for language preservation.

Method: Evaluated multiple pretrained language models (including large language models) across 10 languages using explicit instructions and contextual information for loanword identification tasks.

Result: Models performed poorly in distinguishing loanwords from native ones, corroborating previous evidence that NLP systems exhibit bias toward loanwords rather than native equivalents.

Conclusion: The findings highlight limitations in current NLP systems for minority language applications and emphasize the need for developing tools that better support language preservation in communities under lexical pressure from dominant languages.

Abstract: Throughout language history, words are borrowed from one language to another
and gradually become integrated into the recipient's lexicon. Speakers can
often differentiate these loanwords from native vocabulary, particularly in
bilingual communities where a dominant language continuously imposes lexical
items on a minority language. This paper investigates whether pretrained
language models, including large language models, possess similar capabilities
for loanword identification. We evaluate multiple models across 10 languages.
Despite explicit instructions and contextual information, our results show that
models perform poorly in distinguishing loanwords from native ones. These
findings corroborate previous evidence that modern NLP systems exhibit a bias
toward loanwords rather than native equivalents. Our work has implications for
developing NLP tools for minority languages and supporting language
preservation in communities under lexical pressure from dominant languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents an empirical study of knowledge distillation (KD) behavior across five approaches for multilingual vision-language models (VLMs), examining effects on cross-lingual representation consistency and performance stability under model compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models exhibit uneven performance across languages, which worsens with model size reduction. While knowledge distillation shows promise for transferring knowledge from larger to smaller VLMs, its application in multilingual contexts remains underexplored.

Method: The study conducts controlled empirical analysis of five distillation approaches across CLIP and SigLIP2 models, evaluating them on in-domain retrieval and out-of-domain visual QA tasks.

Result: Some distillation configurations preserve or even improve multilingual retrieval robustness despite halving model size, while others fail to maintain cross-task stability, revealing design-sensitive trade-offs that aggregate accuracy alone doesn't capture.

Conclusion: Knowledge distillation approaches for multilingual VLMs show varying effectiveness, with some configurations successfully maintaining performance across languages despite model compression, while exposing important trade-offs that require careful design considerations beyond simple accuracy metrics.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit uneven performance across languages, a
problem that is often exacerbated when the model size is reduced. While
Knowledge distillation (KD) demonstrates promising results in transferring
knowledge from larger to smaller VLMs, applying KD in multilingualism is an
underexplored area. This paper presents a controlled empirical study of KD
behavior across five distillation approaches, isolating their effects on
cross-lingual representation consistency and downstream performance stability
under model compression. We study five distillation formulations across CLIP
and SigLIP2, and evaluate them on in-domain retrieval and out-of-domain visual
QA. We find that some configurations preserve or even improve multilingual
retrieval robustness despite halving model size, but others fail to maintain
cross-task stability, exposing design-sensitive trade-offs that aggregate
accuracy alone does not reveal.

### [32] [Do LLMs Signal When They're Right? Evidence from Neuron Agreement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26277)
*Kang Chen,Yaoning Wang,Kai Xiong,Zhuoka Feng,Wenhe Sun,Haotian Chen,Yixin Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Neuron Agreement Decoding (NAD) is an unsupervised ensemble method that uses internal neuron activation patterns instead of external signals to select the best reasoning candidates, enabling early correctness prediction and 99% token reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sample-evaluate-ensemble methods rely on poorly calibrated external signals like token probabilities and self-evaluations. Internal neuron activations provide richer, more reliable signals for correctness assessment.

Method: NAD analyzes internal neuron activations to measure sparsity (fewer unique neurons activated for correct responses) and cross-sample agreement (stronger activation patterns for correct responses). It selects candidates based on these internal signals without requiring comparable textual outputs.

Result: NAD matches majority voting on math/science benchmarks and outperforms Avg@64 on open-ended coding tasks. It enables early correctness prediction within 32 tokens and reduces token usage by 99% with minimal quality loss.

Conclusion: Internal neuron activation signals provide reliable, scalable, and efficient guidance for label-free ensemble decoding, enabling dramatic efficiency improvements while maintaining reasoning quality.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) commonly boost reasoning via
sample-evaluate-ensemble decoders, achieving label free gains without ground
truth. However, prevailing strategies score candidates using only external
outputs such as token probabilities, entropies, or self evaluations, and these
signals can be poorly calibrated after post training. We instead analyze
internal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings: (1)
external signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics;
(2) correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than
incorrect ones throughout generation; and (3) activations from correct
responses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement, whereas incorrect ones
diverge. Motivated by these observations, we propose Neuron Agreement Decoding
(NAD), an unsupervised best-of-N method that selects candidates using
activation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement, operating solely on
internal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs. NAD enables
early correctness prediction within the first 32 generated tokens and supports
aggressive early stopping. Across math and science benchmarks with verifiable
answers, NAD matches majority voting; on open ended coding benchmarks where
majority voting is inapplicable, NAD consistently outperforms Avg@64. By
pruning unpromising trajectories early, NAD reduces token usage by 99% with
minimal loss in generation quality, showing that internal signals provide
reliable, scalable, and efficient guidance for label free ensemble decoding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs develop accurate and interchangeable number representations despite output errors, enabling universal probes to trace error causes to specific layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the conflict between LLMs' accurate number representations and their tendency to produce erroneous numeric outputs.

Method: Explored how language models manipulate numbers, quantified accuracy bounds, created universal probes for each LLM, and traced information flow through layers.

Result: Found that different LLMs learn systematic, highly accurate, and universal number representations across hidden states and input contexts, allowing error tracing to specific layers.

Conclusion: Provides fundamental understanding of how pre-trained LLMs manipulate numbers and outlines potential for more accurate probing techniques to refine LLM architectures.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that different large language models (LLMs) converge to
similar and accurate input embedding representations for numbers. These
findings conflict with the documented propensity of LLMs to produce erroneous
outputs when dealing with numeric information. In this work, we aim to explain
this conflict by exploring how language models manipulate numbers and quantify
the lower bounds of accuracy of these mechanisms. We find that despite
surfacing errors, different language models learn interchangeable
representations of numbers that are systematic, highly accurate and universal
across their hidden states and the types of input contexts. This allows us to
create universal probes for each LLM and to trace information -- including the
causes of output errors -- to specific layers. Our results lay a fundamental
understanding of how pre-trained LLMs manipulate numbers and outline the
potential of more accurate probing techniques in addressed refinements of LLMs'
architectures.

TL;DR: Early evaluation of ChatGPT Atlas's web interaction capabilities using browser games shows strong performance in logical reasoning tasks like Sudoku but significant struggles in real-time games requiring precise timing and motor control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess Atlas's performance in dynamic, interactive web environments, as its capabilities in such settings remain less explored despite demonstrated information retrieval abilities.

Method: Used browser-based games (T-Rex Runner, Sudoku, Flappy Bird, Stein.world) as test scenarios and employed in-game performance scores as quantitative metrics across different task types.

Result: Atlas performs strongly in logical reasoning tasks (completing Sudoku puzzles significantly faster than humans) but struggles substantially in real-time games requiring precise timing and motor control, often failing to progress beyond initial obstacles.

Conclusion: While Atlas demonstrates capable analytical processing, there remain notable limitations in dynamic web environments requiring real-time interaction.

Abstract: OpenAI's ChatGPT Atlas introduces new capabilities for web interaction,
enabling the model to analyze webpages, process user intents, and execute
cursor and keyboard inputs directly within the browser. While its capacity for
information retrieval tasks has been demonstrated, its performance in dynamic,
interactive environments remains less explored. In this study, we conduct an
early evaluation of Atlas's web interaction capabilities using browser-based
games as test scenarios, including Google's T-Rex Runner, Sudoku, Flappy Bird,
and Stein.world. We employ in-game performance scores as quantitative metrics
to assess performance across different task types. Our results show that Atlas
performs strongly in logical reasoning tasks like Sudoku, completing puzzles
significantly faster than human baselines, but struggles substantially in
real-time games requiring precise timing and motor control, often failing to
progress beyond initial obstacles. These findings suggest that while Atlas
demonstrates capable analytical processing, there remain notable limitations in
dynamic web environments requiring real-time interaction. The website of our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome real-world deployment challenges in educational feedback systems: privacy concerns, limited computational resources, and the need for pedagogically valid responses that require small, open-source models running locally.

Method: SCRIBE combines domain-specific tools with a self-reflective inference pipeline supporting iterative reasoning, tool use, and error recovery. Models are trained via two-stage LoRA fine-tuning on synthetic GPT-4o-generated data.

Result: 8B-SCRIBE models achieve comparable or superior quality to larger models in relevance and actionability, and are perceived on par with GPT-4o and Llama-3.3 70B by students in user studies with 108 participants.

Conclusion: SCRIBE demonstrates viability for low-resource, privacy-sensitive educational applications, showing that small models can effectively provide personalized feedback when properly designed with tool-augmented reasoning.

Abstract: Language models can be used to provide interactive, personalized student
feedback in educational settings. However, real-world deployment faces three
key challenges: privacy concerns, limited computational resources, and the need
for pedagogically valid responses. These constraints require small, open-source
models that can run locally and reliably ground their outputs in correct
information. We introduce SCRIBE, a framework for multi-hop, tool-augmented
reasoning designed to generate valid responses to student questions about
feedback reports. SCRIBE combines domain-specific tools with a self-reflective
inference pipeline that supports iterative reasoning, tool use, and error
recovery. We distil these capabilities into 3B and 8B models via two-stage LoRA
fine-tuning on synthetic GPT-4o-generated data. Evaluation with a human-aligned
GPT-Judge and a user study with 108 students shows that 8B-SCRIBE models
achieve comparable or superior quality to much larger models in key dimensions
such as relevance and actionability, while being perceived on par with GPT-4o
and Llama-3.3 70B by students. These findings demonstrate the viability of
SCRIBE for low-resource, privacy-sensitive educational applications.

TL;DR: ACER transforms general LLMs into domain experts by creating synthetic textbook-style curricula with Bloom's taxonomy-guided QA pairs, achieving significant improvements in specialized domains while maintaining general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models underperform in specialized domains requiring deep understanding, creating a need for methods that can enhance domain expertise without sacrificing general capabilities.

Method: ACER synthesizes comprehensive curricula by generating subject tables of contents and creating question-answer pairs guided by Bloom's taxonomy, then uses continual pretraining with interleaved curriculum scheduling.

Result: ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points in challenging domains like microeconomics, achieves 3 percentage point macro-average improvement across target domains, and enables positive cross-domain knowledge transfer improving non-target domains by 0.7 points.

Conclusion: ACER provides a scalable and effective approach for closing critical domain gaps in LLMs, enhancing specialized knowledge while maintaining general reasoning capabilities and preventing catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at general tasks but underperform in
specialized domains like economics and psychology, which require deep,
principled understanding. To address this, we introduce ACER (Automated
Curriculum-Enhanced Regimen) that transforms generalist models into domain
experts without sacrificing their broad capabilities. ACER first synthesizes a
comprehensive, textbook-style curriculum by generating a table of contents for
a subject and then creating question-answer (QA) pairs guided by Bloom's
taxonomy. This ensures systematic topic coverage and progressively increasing
difficulty. The resulting synthetic corpus is used for continual pretraining
with an interleaved curriculum schedule, aligning learning across both content
and cognitive dimensions.
  Experiments with Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B) show significant gains in specialized
MMLU subsets. In challenging domains like microeconomics, where baselines
struggle, ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points. Across all target
domains, we observe a consistent macro-average improvement of 3 percentage
points. Notably, ACER not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also
facilitates positive cross-domain knowledge transfer, improving performance on
non-target domains by 0.7 points. Beyond MMLU, ACER enhances performance on
knowledge-intensive benchmarks like ARC and GPQA by over 2 absolute points,
while maintaining stable performance on general reasoning tasks. Our results
demonstrate that ACER offers a scalable and effective recipe for closing
critical domain gaps in LLMs.

TL;DR: MisSynth pipeline uses RAG to generate synthetic fallacy data for fine-tuning LLMs, achieving over 35% F1-score improvement on scientific misinformation detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Health-related misinformation is prevalent and harmful, especially when claims distort scientific findings, making it difficult to identify.

Method: Proposed MisSynth pipeline applies retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce synthetic fallacy samples, then fine-tunes LLMs using this synthetic data.

Result: Fine-tuned models show substantial accuracy gains - LLaMA 3.1 8B achieved over 35% F1-score absolute improvement on MISSCI test split compared to vanilla baseline.

Conclusion: Synthetic fallacy data augmentation significantly enhances zero-shot LLM classification performance on real-world scientific misinformation tasks, even with limited computational resources.

Abstract: Health-related misinformation is very prevalent and potentially harmful. It
is difficult to identify, especially when claims distort or misinterpret
scientific findings. We investigate the impact of synthetic data generation and
lightweight fine-tuning techniques on the ability of large language models
(LLMs) to recognize fallacious arguments using the MISSCI dataset and
framework. In this work, we propose MisSynth, a pipeline that applies
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce synthetic fallacy samples,
which are then used to fine-tune an LLM model. Our results show substantial
accuracy gains with fine-tuned models compared to vanilla baselines. For
instance, the LLaMA 3.1 8B fine-tuned model achieved an over 35% F1-score
absolute improvement on the MISSCI test split over its vanilla baseline. We
demonstrate that introducing synthetic fallacy data to augment limited
annotated resources can significantly enhance zero-shot LLM classification
performance on real-world scientific misinformation tasks, even with limited
computational resources. The code and synthetic dataset are available on

TL;DR: Proposes an interaction-centric framework for automatic LLM team composition using semantic coherence from pairwise conversations to form synergistic model clusters without requiring prior knowledge about models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent LLM approaches show promise but require optimal team composition, which is challenging due to model opacity that obscures internal characteristics needed for effective collaboration.

Method: Constructs a 'language model graph' mapping relationships between models from semantic coherence of pairwise conversations, then applies community detection to identify synergistic model clusters without needing model architectures, training data, or task performance knowledge.

Result: Method discovers functionally coherent groups reflecting latent specializations. Primed conversations with specific topics identified synergistic teams that outperform random baselines and achieve comparable accuracy to manually-curated teams based on known model specializations.

Conclusion: Provides a new basis for automated design of collaborative multi-agent LLM teams through interaction-centric analysis of semantic coherence.

Abstract: While a multi-agent approach based on large language models (LLMs) represents
a promising strategy to surpass the capabilities of single models, its success
is critically dependent on synergistic team composition. However, forming
optimal teams is a significant challenge, as the inherent opacity of most
models obscures the internal characteristics necessary for effective
collaboration. In this paper, we propose an interaction-centric framework for
automatic team composition that does not require any prior knowledge including
their internal architectures, training data, or task performances. Our method
constructs a "language model graph" that maps relationships between models from
the semantic coherence of pairwise conversations, and then applies community
detection to identify synergistic model clusters. Our experiments with diverse
LLMs demonstrate that the proposed method discovers functionally coherent
groups that reflect their latent specializations. Priming conversations with
specific topics identified synergistic teams which outperform random baselines
on downstream benchmarks and achieve comparable accuracy to that of
manually-curated teams based on known model specializations. Our findings
provide a new basis for the automated design of collaborative multi-agent LLM
teams.

Method: The study presents a preliminary investigation using pretrained language models (PLMs) and large language models (LLMs) for discourse relation classification (DRC) in scientific publications, examining how context defined by discourse structure helps with this task.

Result: Experiments show that context, as defined by discourse structure, is generally helpful for discourse relation classification. The analysis also identifies which scientific discourse relation types benefit most from context.

Conclusion: Contextual information from discourse structure improves discourse relation classification in scientific publications, with certain relation types showing greater benefits, providing a foundation for using discourse-level information to support AI-generated scientific claims.

TL;DR: OmniEduBench is a comprehensive Chinese educational benchmark with 24.6K question-answer pairs covering both knowledge and cultivation dimensions across 61 subjects, revealing significant performance gaps between current LLMs and human intelligence in educational applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs and benchmarks focus primarily on knowledge dimension while neglecting cultivation capabilities essential for real-world education, particularly lacking diversity in Chinese educational context.

Method: Developed OmniEduBench with 24.6K high-quality question-answer pairs divided into knowledge (18.1K) and cultivation (6.5K) dimensions, each with 6 categories covering 61 subjects and 11 question formats.

Result: Experiments on 11 LLMs show significant performance gaps: only Gemini-2.5 Pro exceeded 60% accuracy in knowledge dimension, while best model (QWQ) trailed human intelligence by nearly 30% in cultivation dimension.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have substantial room for improvement in educational applications, particularly in cultivation capabilities, highlighting the challenges of applying LLMs effectively in education.

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), various LLM-based
works have been widely applied in educational fields. However, most existing
LLMs and their benchmarks focus primarily on the knowledge dimension, largely
neglecting the evaluation of cultivation capabilities that are essential for
real-world educational scenarios. Additionally, current benchmarks are often
limited to a single subject or question type, lacking sufficient diversity.
This issue is particularly prominent within the Chinese context. To address
this gap, we introduce OmniEduBench, a comprehensive Chinese educational
benchmark. OmniEduBench consists of 24.602K high-quality question-answer pairs.
The data is meticulously divided into two core dimensions: the knowledge
dimension and the cultivation dimension, which contain 18.121K and 6.481K
entries, respectively. Each dimension is further subdivided into 6 fine-grained
categories, covering a total of 61 different subjects (41 in the knowledge and
20 in the cultivation). Furthermore, the dataset features a rich variety of
question formats, including 11 common exam question types, providing a solid
foundation for comprehensively evaluating LLMs' capabilities in education.
Extensive experiments on 11 mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs
reveal a clear performance gap. In the knowledge dimension, only Gemini-2.5 Pro
surpassed 60\% accuracy, while in the cultivation dimension, the
best-performing model, QWQ, still trailed human intelligence by nearly 30\%.
These results highlight the substantial room for improvement and underscore the
challenges of applying LLMs in education.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face deployment challenges due to high bandwidth and computational demands. While pruning and low-rank methods work individually, their combined potential remains unexplored.

Method: Formulates low-rank approximation and sparse optimization as a unified problem solved through iterative optimization, leveraging low-rank for structure preservation and sparsity for removing non-essential weights.

Result: SSLC consistently outperforms standalone methods on LLaMA and Qwen2.5 models (7B-70B), achieving state-of-the-art compression with 50% size reduction on Qwen2.5 and at least 1.63× speedup.

Conclusion: SSLC provides a practical solution for efficient LLM deployment by synergistically combining sparse and low-rank compression techniques without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
language comprehension and generation; however, their widespread adoption is
constrained by substantial bandwidth and computational demands. While pruning
and low-rank approximation have each demonstrated promising performance
individually, their synergy for LLMs remains underexplored. We introduce
\underline{S}ynergistic \underline{S}parse and \underline{L}ow-Rank
\underline{C}ompression (SSLC) methods for LLMs, which leverages the strengths
of both techniques: low-rank approximation compresses the model by retaining
its essential structure with minimal information loss, whereas sparse
optimization eliminates non-essential weights, preserving those crucial for
generalization. Based on theoretical analysis, we first formulate the low-rank
approximation and sparse optimization as a unified problem and solve it by
iterative optimization algorithm. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen2.5 models
(7B-70B) show that SSLC, without any additional training steps, consistently
surpasses standalone methods, achieving state-of-the-arts results. Notably,
SSLC compresses Qwen2.5 by 50\% with no performance drop and achieves at least
1.63$\times$ speedup, offering a practical solution for efficient LLM
deployment.

TL;DR: The paper proposes BNLF, a Bayesian network framework that fuses predictions from multiple LLMs (FinBERT, RoBERTa, BERTweet) for sentiment analysis, achieving ~6% accuracy improvement over individual models while providing interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current domain-specific LLMs lack transparency, are costly to fine-tune, require extensive prompt engineering, produce inconsistent results across domains, and have high environmental impact due to computational demands.

Method: BNLF framework integrates predictions from three LLMs (FinBERT, RoBERTa, BERTweet) using Bayesian networks, performing late fusion by modeling sentiment predictions as probabilistic nodes within the network.

Result: Evaluated on three human-annotated financial corpora with distinct characteristics, BNLF consistently achieved approximately 6% higher accuracy compared to baseline LLMs, demonstrating robustness to dataset variability.

Conclusion: Probabilistic fusion through Bayesian networks provides an effective approach for interpretable sentiment classification, offering consistent performance gains while addressing limitations of individual LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, with an increasing number
of domain-specific variants tailored for specialised tasks. However, these
models often lack transparency and explainability, can be costly to fine-tune,
require substantial prompt engineering, yield inconsistent results across
domains, and impose significant adverse environmental impact due to their high
computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose the Bayesian
network LLM fusion (BNLF) framework, which integrates predictions from three
LLMs, including FinBERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet, through a probabilistic
mechanism for sentiment analysis. BNLF performs late fusion by modelling the
sentiment predictions from multiple LLMs as probabilistic nodes within a
Bayesian network. Evaluated across three human-annotated financial corpora with
distinct linguistic and contextual characteristics, BNLF demonstrates
consistent gains of about six percent in accuracy over the baseline LLMs,
underscoring its robustness to dataset variability and the effectiveness of
probabilistic fusion for interpretable sentiment classification.

TL;DR: This study demonstrates that an ensemble of multiple LLM agents provides more reliable assessment of AI triage tools than single LLMs, with open-source models like Llama3.3:70b performing comparably to GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if an ensemble of multiple LLM agents could provide more reliable assessment of pixel-based AI triage tools than single LLMs, addressing the need for consistent evaluation methods in clinical AI applications.

Method: Analyzed 29,766 non-contrast CT head exams from 14 hospitals using a commercial ICH AI detection tool. Radiology reports were evaluated by an ensemble of 8 open-source LLMs and GPT-4o using multi-shot prompts. 1,726 examples were manually reviewed. Performance was compared across models and consensus approaches.

Result: Llama3.3:70b achieved highest performance (AUC=0.78, AP=0.75, F1=0.81, recall=0.85). Ensemble methods (Full-9, Top-3, Consensus) showed higher MCC scores than GPT-4o alone, with no significant differences between ensemble approaches. Open-source models performed comparably to proprietary models.

Conclusion: Ensembles of medium to large open-source LLMs provide more consistent and reliable ground truth evaluation for clinical AI triage tools compared to single LLMs, offering a viable alternative to proprietary models.

Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if an ensemble of
multiple LLM agents could be used collectively to provide a more reliable
assessment of a pixel-based AI triage tool than a single LLM.
  Methods: 29,766 non-contrast CT head exams from fourteen hospitals were
processed by a commercial intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) AI detection tool.
Radiology reports were analyzed by an ensemble of eight open-source LLM models
and a HIPAA compliant internal version of GPT-4o using a single multi-shot
prompt that assessed for presence of ICH. 1,726 examples were manually
reviewed. Performance characteristics of the eight open-source models and
consensus were compared to GPT-4o. Three ideal consensus LLM ensembles were
tested for rating the performance of the triage tool.
  Results: The cohort consisted of 29,766 head CTs exam-report pairs. The
highest AUC performance was achieved with llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AUC= 0.78).
The average precision was highest for Llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AP=0.75 & 0.76).
Llama3.3:70b had the highest F1 score (0.81) and recall (0.85), greater
precision (0.78), specificity (0.72), and MCC (0.57). Using MCC (95% CI) the
ideal combination of LLMs were: Full-9 Ensemble 0.571 (0.552-0.591), Top-3
Ensemble 0.558 (0.537-0.579), Consensus 0.556 (0.539-0.574), and GPT4o 0.522
(0.500-0.543). No statistically significant differences were observed between
Top-3, Full-9, and Consensus (p > 0.05).
  Conclusion: An ensemble of medium to large sized open-source LLMs provides a
more consistent and reliable method to derive a ground truth retrospective
evaluation of a clinical AI triage tool over a single LLM alone.

### [44] [Inside CORE-KG: Evaluating Structured Prompting and Coreference Resolution for Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26512)
*Dipak Meher,Carlotta Domeniconi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Ablation study of CORE-KG framework shows that coreference resolution reduces node duplication by 28.32% and structured prompts reduce noisy nodes by 73.33% in legal document knowledge graph construction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human smuggling networks are complex and adaptive, with legal case documents being unstructured, lexically dense, and containing ambiguous references that challenge automated knowledge graph construction. Existing LLM-based approaches generate noisy, fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes.

Method: Systematic ablation study of CORE-KG framework to quantify contributions of its two key components: type-aware coreference module and domain-guided structured prompts.

Result: Removing coreference resolution caused 28.32% increase in node duplication and 4.32% increase in noisy nodes. Removing structured prompts caused 4.34% increase in node duplication and 73.33% increase in noisy nodes.

Conclusion: The findings provide empirical insights for designing robust LLM-based pipelines for extracting structured representations from complex legal texts, demonstrating the critical importance of both coreference resolution and structured prompts.

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze.
Legal case documents offer critical insights but are often unstructured,
lexically dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, which pose
significant challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. While
recent LLM-based approaches improve over static templates, they still generate
noisy, fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes due to the absence of guided
extraction and coreference resolution. The recently proposed CORE-KG framework
addresses these limitations by integrating a type-aware coreference module and
domain-guided structured prompts, significantly reducing node duplication and
legal noise. In this work, we present a systematic ablation study of CORE-KG to
quantify the individual contributions of its two key components. Our results
show that removing coreference resolution results in a 28.32% increase in node
duplication and a 4.32% increase in noisy nodes, while removing structured
prompts leads to a 4.34% increase in node duplication and a 73.33% increase in
noisy nodes. These findings offer empirical insights for designing robust
LLM-based pipelines for extracting structured representations from complex
legal texts.

*Yair Elboher,Yuval Pinter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DIVRIT is a novel Hebrew diacritization system that treats the task as zero-shot classification using a visual language model to process undiacritized text as images, achieving high accuracy in oracle settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hebrew diacritics restoration is crucial for accurate pronunciation and meaning disambiguation, but the language has high ambiguity when unvocalized. Recent ML approaches have advanced performance, but there's need for more effective methods.

Method: Frames diacritization as zero-shot classification at word level, selecting appropriate diacritization patterns from dynamically generated candidates based on context. Uses Hebrew Visual Language Model that processes undiacritized text as images to embed diacritic information directly in vector representations.

Result: System effectively performs diacritization without complex linguistic analysis. In oracle settings where correct form is guaranteed among candidates, achieves high accuracy. Architectural enhancements and optimized training yield significant improvements in generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: Visual representations show promising potential for accurate and automated Hebrew diacritization, demonstrating the effectiveness of the DIVRIT system's innovative approach.

Abstract: Diacritics restoration in Hebrew is a fundamental task for ensuring accurate
word pronunciation and disambiguating textual meaning. Despite the language's
high degree of ambiguity when unvocalized, recent machine learning approaches
have significantly advanced performance on this task.
  In this work, we present DIVRIT, a novel system for Hebrew diacritization
that frames the task as a zero-shot classification problem. Our approach
operates at the word level, selecting the most appropriate diacritization
pattern for each undiacritized word from a dynamically generated candidate set,
conditioned on the surrounding textual context. A key innovation of DIVRIT is
its use of a Hebrew Visual Language Model, which processes undiacritized text
as an image, allowing diacritic information to be embedded directly within the
input's vector representation.
  Through a comprehensive evaluation across various configurations, we
demonstrate that the system effectively performs diacritization without relying
on complex, explicit linguistic analysis. Notably, in an ``oracle'' setting
where the correct diacritized form is guaranteed to be among the provided
candidates, DIVRIT achieves a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, strategic
architectural enhancements and optimized training methodologies yield
significant improvements in the system's overall generalization capabilities.
These findings highlight the promising potential of visual representations for
accurate and automated Hebrew diacritization.

### [46] [The Structure of Relation Decoding Linear Operators in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26543)
*Miranda Anna Christ,Adrián Csiszárik,Gergely Becsó,Dániel Varga*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes linear relational decoders in transformer language models, showing they encode coarse-grained semantic properties rather than distinct relations, which explains their compressibility and limited generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the organization and structure of linear operators that decode relational facts in transformer language models, extending previous single-relation findings to multiple relations.

Method: Systematically charted collections of relation decoders, compressed them using order-3 tensor networks, and developed a cross-evaluation protocol to test decoders on subjects from other relations.

Result: Found that linear decoders encode recurring semantic properties rather than distinct relations, explaining their high compressibility and why they only generalize to semantically similar relations.

Conclusion: Linear relational decoding in transformers is primarily property-based rather than relation-specific, clarifying both compressibility and generalization patterns.

Abstract: This paper investigates the structure of linear operators introduced in
Hernandez et al. [2023] that decode specific relational facts in transformer
language models. We extend their single-relation findings to a collection of
relations and systematically chart their organization. We show that such
collections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3
tensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this
surprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we
apply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our
results reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but
extract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital
city and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This
property-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and
highlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically
close. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer
language models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.

*Kun Luo,Hongjin Qian,Zheng Liu,Ziyi Xia,Shitao Xiao,Siqi Bao,Jun Zhao,Kang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InfoFlow addresses low reward density in RLVR by decomposing tasks, providing failure-guided hints, and using dual-agent architecture to improve exploration efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR faces challenges with low reward density in deep search scenarios where agents incur high exploration costs for infrequent rewards.

Method: InfoFlow uses subproblem decomposition, failure-guided hints, and dual-agent refinement to optimize reward density.

Result: InfoFlow outperforms strong baselines on agentic search benchmarks, enabling lightweight LLMs to match advanced proprietary LLM performance.

Conclusion: InfoFlow effectively solves the reward density optimization problem in RLVR through systematic framework design.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for enhancing agentic deep search. However, its application is often hindered
by low \textbf{Reward Density} in deep search scenarios, where agents expend
significant exploratory costs for infrequent and often null final rewards. In
this paper, we formalize this challenge as the \textbf{Reward Density
Optimization} problem, which aims to improve the reward obtained per unit of
exploration cost. This paper introduce \textbf{InfoFlow}, a systematic
framework that tackles this problem from three aspects. 1) \textbf{Subproblem
decomposition}: breaking down long-range tasks to assign process rewards,
thereby providing denser learning signals. 2) \textbf{Failure-guided hints}:
injecting corrective guidance into stalled trajectories to increase the
probability of successful outcomes. 3) \textbf{Dual-agent refinement}:
employing a dual-agent architecture to offload the cognitive burden of deep
exploration. A refiner agent synthesizes the search history, which effectively
compresses the researcher's perceived trajectory, thereby reducing exploration
cost and increasing the overall reward density. We evaluate InfoFlow on
multiple agentic search benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms strong
baselines, enabling lightweight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to
advanced proprietary LLMs.

TL;DR: CAST is a new dynamic tree decoding approach that optimizes speculative decoding by considering GPU configurations and batch sizes, achieving up to 5.2x speedup over conventional methods and outperforming state-of-the-art techniques by 5-20%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models face significant inference latency due to autoregressive design and large size. Existing speculative decoding approaches like EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3 neglect the impact of crucial system variables such as GPU devices and batch sizes.

Method: Introduces CAST, a dynamic tree decoding approach that considers inference costs including GPU configurations and batch sizes to dynamically refine the tree structure.

Result: Achieves speeds up to 5.2 times faster than conventional decoding methods and generally outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques from 5% to 20% across six diverse tasks using six distinct LLMs.

Conclusion: CAST effectively addresses LLM inference latency by incorporating system-level optimization factors into speculative decoding, demonstrating significant performance improvements over both conventional methods and existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant inference latency challenges
stemming from their autoregressive design and large size. To address this,
speculative decoding emerges as a solution, enabling the simultaneous
generation and validation of multiple tokens. While recent approaches like
EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3 improve speculative decoding using dynamic tree structures,
they often neglect the impact of crucial system variables such as GPU devices
and batch sizes.
  Therefore, we introduce a new dynamic tree decoding approach called CAST that
takes into account inference costs, including factors such as GPU
configurations and batch sizes, to dynamically refine the tree structure.
Through comprehensive experimentation across six diverse tasks and utilizing
six distinct LLMs, our methodology demonstrates remarkable results, achieving
speeds up to 5.2 times faster than conventional decoding methods. Moreover, it
generally outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques from 5% to 20%.

TL;DR: SlideAgent is an agentic framework that improves multi-page visual document understanding by decomposing reasoning into global, page, and element levels, achieving significant performance gains over existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems struggle with complex multi-page visual documents that convey information through layout, colors, icons, and cross-slide references, particularly in fine-grained reasoning over elements and pages.

Method: SlideAgent employs specialized agents and decomposes reasoning into three levels (global, page, and element) to construct a structured, query-agnostic representation that captures both overarching themes and detailed visual/textual cues. During inference, it selectively activates specialized agents for multi-level reasoning.

Result: Extensive experiments show SlideAgent achieves significant improvement over both proprietary models (+7.9 overall) and open-source models (+9.8 overall).

Conclusion: SlideAgent provides a versatile agentic framework for understanding multi-modal, multi-page, and multi-layout documents, especially slide decks, by effectively capturing both high-level themes and fine-grained details through multi-level reasoning.

Abstract: Multi-page visual documents such as manuals, brochures, presentations, and
posters convey key information through layout, colors, icons, and cross-slide
references. While large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities in document
understanding, current systems struggle with complex, multi-page visual
documents, particularly in fine-grained reasoning over elements and pages. We
introduce SlideAgent, a versatile agentic framework for understanding
multi-modal, multi-page, and multi-layout documents, especially slide decks.
SlideAgent employs specialized agents and decomposes reasoning into three
specialized levels-global, page, and element-to construct a structured,
query-agnostic representation that captures both overarching themes and
detailed visual or textual cues. During inference, SlideAgent selectively
activates specialized agents for multi-level reasoning and integrates their
outputs into coherent, context-aware answers. Extensive experiments show that
SlideAgent achieves significant improvement over both proprietary (+7.9
overall) and open-source models (+9.8 overall).

### [50] [Encoder-Decoder or Decoder-Only? Revisiting Encoder-Decoder Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26622)
*Biao Zhang,Yong Cheng,Siamak Shakeri,Xinyi Wang,Min Ma,Orhan Firat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper revisits encoder-decoder LLMs (RedLLM) and compares them with decoder-only LLMs (DecLLM) across different model scales, finding that RedLLM shows compelling scaling properties, strong performance, and better inference efficiency after instruction tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid shift from encoder-decoder to decoder-only LLM architectures occurred without rigorous comparative analysis from a scaling perspective, potentially overlooking the potential of encoder-decoder models.

Method: Enhanced encoder-decoder LLM (RedLLM) with recent recipes from decoder-only LLM, pretrained with prefix language modeling using RedPajama V1 (1.6T tokens), and compared with DecLLM pretrained with causal LM across scales from ~150M to ~8B parameters, followed by FLAN instruction tuning.

Result: RedLLM produces compelling scaling properties and surprisingly strong performance. While DecLLM is more compute-optimal during pretraining, RedLLM shows comparable scaling and context length extrapolation capabilities. After instruction tuning, RedLLM achieves comparable or better downstream task results with substantially better inference efficiency.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that encoder-decoder LLMs deserve re-examination as they show potential for developing powerful and efficient LLMs, with better inference efficiency after instruction tuning.

Abstract: Recent large language model (LLM) research has undergone an architectural
shift from encoder-decoder modeling to nowadays the dominant decoder-only
modeling. This rapid transition, however, comes without a rigorous comparative
analysis especially \textit{from the scaling perspective}, raising concerns
that the potential of encoder-decoder models may have been overlooked. To fill
this gap, we revisit encoder-decoder LLM (RedLLM), enhancing it with recent
recipes from decoder-only LLM (DecLLM). We conduct a comprehensive comparison
between RedLLM, pretrained with prefix language modeling (LM), and DecLLM,
pretrained with causal LM, at different model scales, ranging from $\sim$150M
to $\sim$8B. Using RedPajama V1 (1.6T tokens) for pretraining and FLAN for
instruction tuning, our experiments show that RedLLM produces compelling
scaling properties and surprisingly strong performance. While DecLLM is overall
more compute-optimal during pretraining, RedLLM demonstrates comparable scaling
and context length extrapolation capabilities. After instruction tuning, RedLLM
achieves comparable and even better results on various downstream tasks while
enjoying substantially better inference efficiency. We hope our findings could
inspire more efforts on re-examining RedLLM, unlocking its potential for
developing powerful and efficient LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evontree is a framework that uses ontology rules to extract, validate, and enhance domain knowledge in LLMs without extensive external datasets, achieving up to 3.7% accuracy improvement in medical QA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle in data-sensitive domains like healthcare due to lack of high-quality domain-specific training data, while domain experts have valuable knowledge in ontology rules that can be leveraged.

Method: Extracts domain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core ontology rules, and reinforces refined knowledge via self-distilled fine-tuning.

Result: Consistent outperformance over unmodified models and leading supervised baselines on medical QA benchmarks with Llama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2, achieving up to 3.7% improvement in accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach is effective, efficient, and robust for low-resource domain adaptation of LLMs, demonstrating the value of leveraging ontology rules to enhance domain knowledge.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities
across multiple domains by leveraging massive pre-training and curated
fine-tuning data. However, in data-sensitive fields such as healthcare, the
lack of high-quality, domain-specific training corpus hinders LLMs' adaptation
for specialized applications. Meanwhile, domain experts have distilled domain
wisdom into ontology rules, which formalize relationships among concepts and
ensure the integrity of knowledge management repositories. Viewing LLMs as
implicit repositories of human knowledge, we propose Evontree, a novel
framework that leverages a small set of high-quality ontology rules to
systematically extract, validate, and enhance domain knowledge within LLMs,
without requiring extensive external datasets. Specifically, Evontree extracts
domain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core
ontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled
fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with
Llama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both
unmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7%
improvement in accuracy. These results confirm the effectiveness, efficiency,
and robustness of our approach for low-resource domain adaptation of LLMs.

TL;DR: Kimi Linear is a hybrid linear attention architecture that outperforms full attention across various scenarios while reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6x decoding throughput for 1M context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a linear attention architecture that can outperform full attention while maintaining efficiency, particularly for long-context scenarios where traditional attention mechanisms face computational challenges.

Method: Uses Kimi Delta Attention (KDA) with finer-grained gating mechanism and a bespoke chunkwise algorithm with specialized DPLR transition matrices. Implements a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) in a 3B activated parameter model.

Result: Outperforms full MLA across all evaluated tasks with identical training recipe, reduces KV cache usage by up to 75%, achieves up to 6x decoding throughput for 1M context, and demonstrates superior performance in tasks with longer input and output lengths.

Conclusion: Kimi Linear serves as a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior performance and efficiency, making it suitable for various scenarios including long-context applications.

Abstract: We introduce Kimi Linear, a hybrid linear attention architecture that, for
the first time, outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across
various scenarios -- including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement
learning (RL) scaling regimes. At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an
expressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a
finer-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited
finite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware
efficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)
transition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the
general DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical
delta rule.
  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total
parameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention
(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear
outperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while
reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding
throughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be
a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior
performance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output
lengths.
  To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM
implementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model
checkpoints.

TL;DR: AutoDeco enables truly end-to-end LLM generation by learning to control its own decoding strategy through lightweight heads that dynamically predict temperature and top-p values alongside next-token logits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs depend on non-differentiable decoding processes requiring manual hyperparameter tuning, making 'end-to-end' a misnomer.

Method: Augment standard transformer with lightweight heads that dynamically predict context-specific temperature and top-p values at each step, transforming decoding into parametric token-level process.

Result: AutoDeco significantly outperforms default decoding strategies and achieves performance comparable to oracle-tuned baseline across eight benchmarks, with emergent instruction-based decoding control capability.

Conclusion: AutoDeco opens new paradigm for steerable and interactive LLM decoding by enabling models to self-regulate sampling strategy and interpret natural language commands for decoding control.

Abstract: The "end-to-end" label for LLMs is a misnomer. In practice, they depend on a
non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of
hyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a
novel architecture that enables truly "end-to-end" generation by learning to
control its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with
lightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific
temperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach
transforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model
to self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.
  Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that
AutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but
also achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from
"hacking the test set"-a practical upper bound for any static method.
Crucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding
control: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g.,
"generate with low randomness") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p
on a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive
LLM decoding.

*Mehar Bhatia,Shravan Nayak,Gaurav Kamath,Marius Mosbach,Karolina Stańczak,Vered Shwartz,Siva Reddy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates when and how value alignment emerges during LLM post-training, finding that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) primarily establishes model values while preference optimization rarely re-aligns them, with different algorithms producing different alignment outcomes even with identical preference data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs become more influential, understanding how they learn human values during training is crucial, but prior work focused only on evaluating fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics of value alignment.

Method: Analyzed Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of various sizes using popular SFT and preference optimization datasets/algorithms, plus controlled experiments with synthetic preference data to isolate algorithm effects.

Result: SFT phase generally establishes model values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns them; different preference optimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes even with identical preference data.

Conclusion: The findings provide actionable insights for data curation and algorithm selection to improve model alignment with human values, emphasizing that values are primarily learned during SFT rather than preference optimization.

Abstract: As LLMs occupy an increasingly important role in society, they are more and
more confronted with questions that require them not only to draw on their
general knowledge but also to align with certain human value systems.
Therefore, studying the alignment of LLMs with human values has become a
crucial field of inquiry. Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the
alignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which
models learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at
which stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's
post-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training
algorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts
during training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different
sizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization
datasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a
model's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these
values. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables
controlled manipulation of values, we find that different preference
optimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when
preference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into
how values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation,
as well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization
to improve model alignment to human values.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AMO-Bench is a new benchmark with 50 original, IMO-level math problems designed to challenge top LLMs, where even the best model only achieves 52.4% accuracy, showing significant room for improvement in mathematical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing math benchmarks are becoming ineffective due to performance saturation with current LLMs, and there's a need for more rigorous challenges at Olympiad level difficulty to properly assess advanced mathematical reasoning capabilities.

Method: Created 50 human-crafted problems that are cross-validated by experts to meet IMO difficulty standards, entirely original to prevent data memorization, and designed to require only final answers for automatic grading.

Result: Experimental results across 26 LLMs show the best-performing model achieves only 52.4% accuracy, with most models scoring below 40%. However, a promising scaling trend with increased test-time compute was observed.

Conclusion: AMO-Bench reveals significant gaps in current LLMs' mathematical reasoning abilities and provides a challenging benchmark to facilitate further research in advancing reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: We present AMO-Bench, an Advanced Mathematical reasoning benchmark with
Olympiad level or even higher difficulty, comprising 50 human-crafted problems.
Existing benchmarks have widely leveraged high school math competitions for
evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, many existing math competitions are becoming less effective for
assessing top-tier LLMs due to performance saturation (e.g., AIME24/25). To
address this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50
problems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original
problems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization.
Moreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a
proof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental
results across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model
achieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%.
Beyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising
scaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench. These results
highlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in
current LLMs. We release AMO-Bench to facilitate further research into
advancing the reasoning abilities of language models.

*Hyunji Lee,Minseon Kim,Chinmay Singh,Matheus Pereira,Atharv Sonwane,Isadora White,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal,Zhengyan Shi,Alessandro Sordoni,Marc-Alexandre Côté,Xingdi Yuan,Lucas Caccia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Gistify is a task where coding LLMs must create a minimal, self-contained file that reproduces specific functionality from a codebase, requiring structural understanding, execution flow modeling, and large code patch generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As coding agents are increasingly deployed in large codebases, there is a need for automated, challenging codebase-level evaluation methods.

Method: The Gistify task provides coding LLMs with full access to a codebase and a specific entrypoint, requiring them to generate a single file that replicates the output of the same command run under the full codebase while containing only essential components.

Result: Current state-of-the-art models struggle to reliably solve Gistify tasks, especially those with long execution traces.

Conclusion: Gistify presents a challenging evaluation benchmark that reveals limitations in current coding LLMs' abilities to understand codebase structure, model execution flow, and generate large code patches.

Abstract: As coding agents are increasingly deployed in large codebases, the need to
automatically design challenging, codebase-level evaluation is central. We
propose Gistify, a task where a coding LLM must create a single, minimal,
self-contained file that can reproduce a specific functionality of a codebase.
The coding LLM is given full access to a codebase along with a specific
entrypoint (e.g., a python command), and the generated file must replicate the
output of the same command ran under the full codebase, while containing only
the essential components necessary to execute the provided command. Success on
Gistify requires both structural understanding of the codebase, accurate
modeling of its execution flow as well as the ability to produce potentially
large code patches. Our findings show that current state-of-the-art models
struggle to reliably solve Gistify tasks, especially ones with long executions
traces.

*Amir Noorizadegan,Sifan Wang,Leevan Ling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides a comprehensive review of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), covering their theoretical foundations, architectural variants, implementation strategies, and practical guidance for practitioners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically organize and synthesize the rapidly expanding research landscape around KANs, moving beyond simple performance comparisons to provide structured understanding of theoretical foundations and practical implementations.

Method: The review collects and categorizes a vast array of open-source implementations, analyzes different basis function choices (B-splines, Chebyshev/Jacobi polynomials, ReLU compositions, Gaussian RBFs, Fourier series), and surveys techniques for improving accuracy, efficiency, and regularization.

Result: The paper establishes formal equivalence between KANs and MLPs, highlights KANs' superior parameter efficiency, maps the vibrant KAN development ecosystem, and provides a practical "Choose-Your-KAN" guide for practitioners.

Conclusion: The review serves as a structured reference for ongoing KAN research, identifies current research gaps, and provides practical guidance for selecting appropriate KAN architectures, complemented by an associated GitHub repository.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), inspired by the
Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Unlike MLPs, which use fixed
activation functions on nodes, KANs employ learnable univariate basis functions
on edges, offering enhanced expressivity and interpretability. This review
provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of the rapidly expanding KAN
landscape, moving beyond simple performance comparisons to offer a structured
synthesis of theoretical foundations, architectural variants, and practical
implementation strategies. By collecting and categorizing a vast array of
open-source implementations, we map the vibrant ecosystem supporting KAN
development. We begin by bridging the conceptual gap between KANs and MLPs,
establishing their formal equivalence and highlighting the superior parameter
efficiency of the KAN formulation. A central theme of our review is the
critical role of the basis function; we survey a wide array of choices,
including B-splines, Chebyshev and Jacobi polynomials, ReLU compositions,
Gaussian RBFs, and Fourier series, and analyze their respective trade-offs in
terms of smoothness, locality, and computational cost. We then categorize
recent advancements into a clear roadmap, covering techniques for improving
accuracy, efficiency, and regularization. Key topics include physics-informed
loss design, adaptive sampling, domain decomposition, hybrid architectures, and
specialized methods for handling discontinuities. Finally, we provide a
practical "Choose-Your-KAN" guide to help practitioners select appropriate
architectures, and we conclude by identifying current research gaps. The
associated GitHub repository https://github.com/AmirNoori68/kan-review
complements this paper and serves as a structured reference for ongoing KAN
research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HiMAE is a hierarchical masked autoencoder that learns multi-resolution embeddings from wearable sensor data, outperforming state-of-the-art models while being compact enough for real-time edge inference on smartwatches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how temporal resolution affects predictive utility in wearable sensor data, hypothesizing that different clinical outcomes rely on structure at distinct temporal scales.

Method: Introduced HiMAE (Hierarchical Masked Autoencoder), combining masked autoencoding with hierarchical convolutional encoder-decoder architecture to produce multi-resolution embeddings.

Result: HiMAE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art foundation models across classification, regression, and generative benchmarks while being orders of magnitude smaller, achieving sub-millisecond inference on smartwatch CPUs.

Conclusion: HiMAE serves as both an efficient self-supervised learning method and a discovery tool for identifying scale-sensitive structure in wearable health data, transforming temporal resolution from a hyperparameter into an interpretability probe.

Abstract: Wearable sensors provide abundant physiological time series, yet the
principles governing their predictive utility remain unclear. We hypothesize
that temporal resolution is a fundamental axis of representation learning, with
different clinical and behavioral outcomes relying on structure at distinct
scales. To test this resolution hypothesis, we introduce HiMAE (Hierarchical
Masked Autoencoder), a self supervised framework that combines masked
autoencoding with a hierarchical convolutional encoder decoder. HiMAE produces
multi resolution embeddings that enable systematic evaluation of which temporal
scales carry predictive signal, transforming resolution from a hyperparameter
into a probe for interpretability. Across classification, regression, and
generative benchmarks, HiMAE consistently outperforms state of the art
foundation models that collapse scale, while being orders of magnitude smaller.
HiMAE is an efficient representation learner compact enough to run entirely on
watch, achieving sub millisecond inference on smartwatch class CPUs for true
edge inference. Together, these contributions position HiMAE as both an
efficient self supervised learning method and a discovery tool for scale
sensitive structure in wearable health.

Motivation: High-energy materials discovery is constrained by limited experimental data and restricted access to testing facilities, necessitating computational approaches to accelerate discovery.

Method: Combines LSTM networks for molecular generation with Attentive Graph Neural Networks for property predictions, using a transformative embedding space construction strategy that integrates fixed SHA-256 embeddings with partially trainable representations.

Result: Achieved 67.5% validity and 37.5% novelty in generated molecules, with a mean Tanimoto coefficient of 0.214 indicating diverse chemical space generation. Identified 37 new super explosives with predicted detonation velocity higher than 9 km/s.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully generates diverse, novel high-energy molecules and identifies promising candidates for super explosives without requiring pretraining, demonstrating the effectiveness of the combined LSTM-GNN approach with transformative embedding strategy.

Abstract: High-energy materials (HEMs) are critical for propulsion and defense domains,
yet their discovery remains constrained by experimental data and restricted
access to testing facilities. This work presents a novel approach toward
high-energy molecules by combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for
molecular generation and Attentive Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for property
predictions. We propose a transformative embedding space construction strategy
that integrates fixed SHA-256 embeddings with partially trainable
representations. Unlike conventional regularization techniques, this changes
the representational basis itself, reshaping the molecular input space before
learning begins. Without recourse to pretraining, the generator achieves 67.5%
validity and 37.5% novelty. The generated library exhibits a mean Tanimoto
coefficient of 0.214 relative to training set signifying the ability of
framework to generate a diverse chemical space. We identified 37 new super

### [60] [The Kinetics of Reasoning: How Chain-of-Thought Shapes Learning in Transformers?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25791)
*Zihan Pengmei,Costas Mavromatis,Zhengyuan Shen,Yunyi Zhang,Vassilis N. Ioannidis,Huzefa Rangwala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision improves transformer performance but its learning dynamics are unclear. The study investigates CoT learning through grokking experiments on symbolic reasoning tasks, showing CoT accelerates generalization but doesn't overcome high algorithmic complexity tasks, and reveals a transient trace unfaithfulness phase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms by which transformers learn to follow and benefit from chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision, as current understanding of these learning dynamics remains poor despite CoT's substantial performance improvements.

Method: Pretrained transformers on symbolic reasoning tasks with tunable algorithmic complexity and controllable data composition. Compared two training settings: (i) producing only final answers, and (ii) emitting explicit CoT traces before answering. Used three-parameter logistic curve modeling to quantify learning dynamics.

Result: CoT generally improves task performance but benefits depend on task complexity. CoT accelerates generalization but cannot overcome tasks with higher algorithmic complexity like list intersections. Models exhibit transient trace unfaithfulness early in training (correct answers with incorrect CoT steps) before aligning reasoning traces with answers.

Conclusion: CoT supervision alters internal transformer computation mechanistically, accelerates generalization, and trace faithfulness emerges as a dynamic property over training. The study provides a kinetic modeling framework for understanding transformer learning dynamics and characterizes how CoT benefits vary with task complexity.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision can substantially improve transformer
performance, yet the mechanisms by which models learn to follow and benefit
from CoT remain poorly understood. We investigate these learning dynamics
through the lens of grokking by pretraining transformers on symbolic reasoning
tasks with tunable algorithmic complexity and controllable data composition to
study their generalization. Models were trained under two settings: (i)
producing only final answers, and (ii) emitting explicit CoT traces before
answering. Our results show that while CoT generally improves task performance,
its benefits depend on task complexity. To quantify these effects, we model the
accuracy of the logarithmic training steps with a three-parameter logistic
curve, revealing how the learning speed and shape vary with task complexity,
data distribution, and the presence of CoT supervision. We also uncover a
transient trace unfaithfulness phase: early in training, models often produce
correct answers while skipping or contradicting CoT steps, before later
aligning their reasoning traces with answers. Empirically, we (1) demonstrate
that CoT accelerates generalization but does not overcome tasks with higher
algorithmic complexity, such as finding list intersections; (2) introduce a
kinetic modeling framework for understanding transformer learning; (3)
characterize trace faithfulness as a dynamic property that emerges over
training; and (4) show CoT alters internal transformer computation
mechanistically.

### [61] [Optimal Information Combining for Multi-Agent Systems Using Adaptive Bias Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25793)
*Siavash M. Alamouti,Fay Arjomandi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a theoretical framework for determining when bias correction in multi-agent systems is worthwhile, using a learnability ratio to quantify predictable bias components. It presents the ABLOC algorithm that achieves performance improvements up to 70% of theoretical maximum when learnability is high.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent systems suffer from systematic biases that vary with environmental conditions, leading to suboptimal decisions in applications like environmental monitoring, financial predictions, and human judgment aggregation. Current approaches either ignore biases or require expensive calibration procedures.

Method: Developed a theoretical framework decomposing biases into learnable systematic and irreducible stochastic components. Introduced the learnability ratio concept and presented the ABLOC algorithm that iteratively learns bias-correcting transformations while optimizing combination weights through closed-form solutions.

Result: Systems with high learnability ratios achieved 40%-70% of theoretical maximum performance improvement, while those with low learnability showed minimal benefit. The learnability ratio was proven to fundamentally bound achievable performance improvement.

Conclusion: The learnability ratio provides quantitative guidance for system designers on when to invest in bias learning versus simpler approaches, with experimental validation confirming the diagnostic criteria for practical deployment decisions.

Abstract: Modern multi-agent systems ranging from sensor networks monitoring critical
infrastructure to crowdsourcing platforms aggregating human intelligence can
suffer significant performance degradation due to systematic biases that vary
with environmental conditions. Current approaches either ignore these biases,
leading to suboptimal decisions, or require expensive calibration procedures
that are often infeasible in practice. This performance gap has real
consequences: inaccurate environmental monitoring, unreliable financial
predictions, and flawed aggregation of human judgments. This paper addresses
the fundamental question: when can we learn and correct for these unknown
biases to recover near-optimal performance, and when is such learning futile?
We develop a theoretical framework that decomposes biases into learnable
systematic components and irreducible stochastic components, introducing the
concept of learnability ratio as the fraction of bias variance predictable from
observable covariates. This ratio determines whether bias learning is
worthwhile for a given system. We prove that the achievable performance
improvement is fundamentally bounded by this learnability ratio, providing
system designers with quantitative guidance on when to invest in bias learning
versus simpler approaches. We present the Adaptive Bias Learning and Optimal
Combining (ABLOC) algorithm, which iteratively learns bias-correcting
transformations while optimizing combination weights through closedform
solutions, guaranteeing convergence to these theoretical bounds. Experimental
validation demonstrates that systems with high learnability ratios can recover
significant performance (we achieved 40%-70% of theoretical maximum improvement
in our examples), while those with low learnability show minimal benefit,
validating our diagnostic criteria for practical deployment decisions.

### [62] [Non-myopic Matching and Rebalancing in Large-Scale On-Demand Ride-Pooling Systems Using Simulation-Informed Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25796)
*Farnoosh Namdarpour,Joseph Y. J. Chow*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a simulation-informed reinforcement learning approach for ride-pooling systems to address myopic decision-making, improving service rates, reducing wait times, and enabling fleet size reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ride-pooling services can reduce costs and environmental impacts but suffer from myopic decision-making that overlooks long-term effects of dispatch decisions.

Method: Extends learning and planning framework from ride-hailing to ride-pooling by embedding simulation within learning mechanism, using n-step temporal difference learning on simulated experiences to derive spatiotemporal state values.

Result: Non-myopic policy increases service rate by up to 8.4%, reduces wait and in-vehicle times, decreases fleet size by over 25%, and with rebalancing cuts wait time by 27.3% and in-vehicle time by 12.5%.

Conclusion: The simulation-informed RL approach enables effective non-myopic decision-making in ride-pooling systems, providing significant performance improvements and cost savings for operators.

Abstract: Ride-pooling, also known as ride-sharing, shared ride-hailing, or
microtransit, is a service wherein passengers share rides. This service can
reduce costs for both passengers and operators and reduce congestion and
environmental impacts. A key limitation, however, is its myopic
decision-making, which overlooks long-term effects of dispatch decisions. To
address this, we propose a simulation-informed reinforcement learning (RL)
approach. While RL has been widely studied in the context of ride-hailing
systems, its application in ride-pooling systems has been less explored. In
this study, we extend the learning and planning framework of Xu et al. (2018)
from ride-hailing to ride-pooling by embedding a ride-pooling simulation within
the learning mechanism to enable non-myopic decision-making. In addition, we
propose a complementary policy for rebalancing idle vehicles. By employing
n-step temporal difference learning on simulated experiences, we derive
spatiotemporal state values and subsequently evaluate the effectiveness of the
non-myopic policy using NYC taxi request data. Results demonstrate that the
non-myopic policy for matching can increase the service rate by up to 8.4%
versus a myopic policy while reducing both in-vehicle and wait times for
passengers. Furthermore, the proposed non-myopic policy can decrease fleet size
by over 25% compared to a myopic policy, while maintaining the same level of
performance, thereby offering significant cost savings for operators.
Incorporating rebalancing operations into the proposed framework cuts wait time
by up to 27.3%, in-vehicle time by 12.5%, and raises service rate by 15.1%
compared to using the framework for matching decisions alone at the cost of
increased vehicle minutes traveled per passenger.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MemEIC is a novel method for Continual and Compositional Knowledge Editing (CCKE) in large vision-language models that enables sequential editing of both visual and textual knowledge using a hybrid external-internal editor with dual memory and LoRA adapters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current knowledge editing techniques focus on single modalities in isolation, neglecting the inherent multimodality of LVLMs and the continuous nature of knowledge updates, leading to suboptimal editing outcomes.

Method: MemEIC employs a hybrid external-internal editor with dual external memory for cross-modal evidence retrieval and dual LoRA adapters for disentangled parameter updates per modality, plus a brain-inspired knowledge connector for compositional reasoning.

Result: Experiments show MemEIC significantly improves performance on complex multimodal questions and effectively preserves prior edits.

Conclusion: MemEIC sets a new benchmark for Continual and Compositional Knowledge Editing in large vision-language models by addressing multimodal and continuous knowledge update challenges.

Abstract: The dynamic nature of information necessitates continuously updating large
vision-language models (LVLMs). While recent knowledge editing techniques hint
at promising directions, they often focus on editing a single modality (vision
or language) in isolation. This prevalent practice neglects the inherent
multimodality of LVLMs and the continuous nature of knowledge updates,
potentially leading to suboptimal editing outcomes when considering the
interplay between modalities and the need for ongoing knowledge refinement. To
address these limitations, we propose MemEIC, a novel method for Continual and
Compositional Knowledge Editing (CCKE) in LVLMs. MemEIC enables compositional
editing of both visual and textual knowledge sequentially. Our approach employs
a hybrid external-internal editor featuring a dual external memory for
cross-modal evidence retrieval and dual LoRA adapters that facilitate
disentangled parameter updates for each modality. A key component is a
brain-inspired knowledge connector, activated selectively for compositional
reasoning, that integrates information across different modalities. Experiments
demonstrate that MemEIC significantly improves performance on complex
multimodal questions and effectively preserves prior edits, setting a new
benchmark for CCKE in LVLMs.

TL;DR: The paper addresses spectral bias in time series prediction models and proposes FreLE, a plug-and-play loss function that uses frequency regularization to improve model generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify understanding of spectral bias phenomenon in long-term time series prediction and mitigate its impact, as most existing models exhibit this bias where they fit low-frequency signals before high-frequency ones.

Method: Conducted extensive empirical experiments to measure spectral bias in mainstream models, then proposed FreLE algorithm that enhances model generalization through explicit and implicit frequency regularization.

Result: Found that virtually all models exhibit spectral bias phenomenon. FreLE demonstrated superior performance in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: FreLE effectively mitigates spectral bias in time series prediction models through frequency regularization, providing a plug-and-play solution that improves generalization across various models.

Abstract: The inherent autocorrelation of time series data presents an ongoing
challenge to multivariate time series prediction. Recently, a widely adopted
approach has been the incorporation of frequency domain information to assist
in long-term prediction tasks. Many researchers have independently observed the
spectral bias phenomenon in neural networks, where models tend to fit
low-frequency signals before high-frequency ones. However, these observations
have often been attributed to the specific architectures designed by the
researchers, rather than recognizing the phenomenon as a universal
characteristic across models. To unify the understanding of the spectral bias
phenomenon in long-term time series prediction, we conducted extensive
empirical experiments to measure spectral bias in existing mainstream models.
Our findings reveal that virtually all models exhibit this phenomenon. To
mitigate the impact of spectral bias, we propose the FreLE (Frequency Loss
Enhancement) algorithm, which enhances model generalization through both
explicit and implicit frequency regularization. This is a plug-and-play model
loss function unit. A large number of experiments have proven the superior
performance of FreLE. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPECS is a self-distilled, preference-based cold start framework that replaces SFT with preference training to improve generalization, then hands off to RL for deep reasoning, achieving significant gains on multimodal benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SFT-based cold start in RL for vision language models causes instruction-style overfitting and weakens out-of-distribution generalization, affecting downstream RL performance.

Method: SPECS framework: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via self-distillation, (2) performs preference-based training focusing on surface-form criteria, (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep reasoning.

Result: Improves MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%, reduces in-distribution "stuckness," improves exploration, stabilizes training, and raises performance ceiling.

Conclusion: Decoupling multimodal learning through preference-based cold start with self-distillation yields consistent performance gains and better generalization compared to SFT-based approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has recently catalyzed a
wave of "MLLM-r1" approaches that bring RL to vision language models. Most
representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However,
SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task
solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting,
weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream
RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data
construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to
quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical
study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes
better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose
SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples
multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via
self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation;
(2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow,
transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than
memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep
reasoning results. Experimental results across multiple multimodal benchmarks
show that our decoupling learning framework yields consistent performance gains
over strong baselines, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%.
Additional experiments indicate that SPECS contributes to reducing
in-distribution "stuckness," improving exploration, stabilizing training, and
raising the performance ceiling.

TL;DR: MoE-POT is a sparse-activated transformer that uses mixture-of-experts to efficiently scale parameters while controlling inference costs for solving PDE problems, achieving 40% error reduction with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in PDE neural operator pre-training: heterogeneity of PDE datasets causing high mixed training errors, and dense pre-training models with high inference costs.

Method: Propose Mixture-of-Experts Pre-training Operator Transformer (MoE-POT) with layer-wise router-gating network that dynamically selects 4 experts from 16 expert networks, plus 2 shared experts to capture common PDE properties.

Result: Pre-trained models from 30M to 0.5B parameters on 6 PDE datasets; 90M activated parameter model achieves 40% zero-shot error reduction compared to existing 120M parameter models; interpretability analysis shows dataset types can be inferred from router decisions.

Conclusion: MoE-POT effectively addresses PDE dataset heterogeneity and inference cost issues through sparse activation, achieving superior performance with fewer activated parameters while maintaining interpretability.

Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity and performance
limitations in solving PDE problems with neural operators. However, challenges
remain due to the heterogeneity of PDE datasets in equation types, which leads
to high errors in mixed training. Additionally, dense pre-training models that
scale parameters by increasing network width or depth incur significant
inference costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel
Mixture-of-Experts Pre-training Operator Transformer (MoE-POT), a
sparse-activated architecture that scales parameters efficiently while
controlling inference costs. Specifically, our model adopts a layer-wise
router-gating network to dynamically select 4 routed experts from 16 expert
networks during inference, enabling the model to focus on equation-specific
features. Meanwhile, we also integrate 2 shared experts, aiming to capture
common properties of PDE and reduce redundancy among routed experts. The final
output is computed as the weighted average of the results from all activated
experts. We pre-train models with parameters from 30M to 0.5B on 6 public PDE
datasets. Our model with 90M activated parameters achieves up to a 40%
reduction in zero-shot error compared with existing models with 120M activated
parameters. Additionally, we conduct interpretability analysis, showing that
dataset types can be inferred from router-gating network decisions, which
validates the rationality and effectiveness of the MoE architecture.

### [67] [PRESTO: Preimage-Informed Instruction Optimization for Prompting Black-Box LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25808)
*Jaewon Chu,Seunghun Lee,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRESTO is a novel framework that leverages the preimage structure of soft prompts to optimize instructions for black-box LLMs more efficiently by sharing evaluation scores, using preimage-based initialization, and enforcing score consistency regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for optimizing instructions for black-box LLMs suffer from redundant queries due to white-box LLMs mapping different soft prompts to the same instruction, which previous studies viewed as inefficient but this work reinterprets as useful prior knowledge.

Method: PRESTO consists of three components: (1) score sharing across all soft prompts in a preimage, (2) preimage-based initialization to maximize search space coverage, and (3) score consistency regularization to enforce prediction consistency within each preimage.

Result: PRESTO achieves the effect of effectively obtaining 14 times more scored data under the same query budget, leading to more efficient optimization, as demonstrated by superior performance on 33 instruction optimization tasks.

Conclusion: The preimage structure of soft prompts can be leveraged as useful prior knowledge to accelerate instruction optimization for black-box LLMs, with PRESTO providing an effective framework that significantly improves optimization efficiency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
domains, due to their strong instruction-following capabilities. This has led
to increasing interest in optimizing instructions for black-box LLMs, whose
internal parameters are inaccessible but widely used due to their strong
performance. To optimize instructions for black-box LLMs, recent methods employ
white-box LLMs to generate candidate instructions from optimized soft prompts.
However, white-box LLMs often map different soft prompts to the same
instruction, leading to redundant queries. While previous studies regarded this
many-to-one mapping as a structure that hinders optimization efficiency, we
reinterpret it as a useful prior knowledge that can accelerate the
optimization. To this end, we introduce PREimage-informed inSTruction
Optimization (PRESTO), a novel framework that leverages the preimage structure
of soft prompts for efficient optimization. PRESTO consists of three key
components: (1) score sharing, which shares the evaluation score with all soft
prompts in a preimage; (2) preimage-based initialization, which selects initial
data points that maximize search space coverage using preimage information; and
(3) score consistency regularization, which enforces prediction consistency
within each preimage. By leveraging preimages, PRESTO achieves the effect of
effectively obtaining 14 times more scored data under the same query budget,
resulting in more efficient optimization. Experimental results on 33
instruction optimization tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PRESTO.

TL;DR: ScaleDiff is a training-free framework that extends the resolution of pretrained diffusion models using Neighborhood Patch Attention, Latent Frequency Mixing, and Structure Guidance to improve image quality and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models perform poorly at resolutions beyond their training data, and existing training-free methods are either computationally expensive or incompatible with newer Diffusion Transformer models.

Method: Uses Neighborhood Patch Attention to reduce computational redundancy in self-attention layers, integrates it with SDEdit pipeline, adds Latent Frequency Mixing for fine details, and applies Structure Guidance for better global structure.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance among training-free methods in both image quality and inference speed on both U-Net and Diffusion Transformer architectures.

Conclusion: ScaleDiff provides an efficient, model-agnostic solution for resolution extension in diffusion models without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models often exhibit degraded performance when
generating images beyond their training resolution. Recent training-free
methods can mitigate this limitation, but they often require substantial
computation or are incompatible with recent Diffusion Transformer models. In
this paper, we propose ScaleDiff, a model-agnostic and highly efficient
framework for extending the resolution of pretrained diffusion models without
any additional training. A core component of our framework is Neighborhood
Patch Attention (NPA), an efficient mechanism that reduces computational
redundancy in the self-attention layer with non-overlapping patches. We
integrate NPA into an SDEdit pipeline and introduce Latent Frequency Mixing
(LFM) to better generate fine details. Furthermore, we apply Structure Guidance
to enhance global structure during the denoising process. Experimental results
demonstrate that ScaleDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance among
training-free methods in terms of both image quality and inference speed on
both U-Net and Diffusion Transformer architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: π_RL is a framework for training flow-based Vision-Language-Action models using reinforcement learning, overcoming challenges with iterative denoising processes through two novel RL algorithms that enable scalable parallel simulation training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of applying large-scale reinforcement learning to flow-based VLAs due to intractable action log-likelihoods from iterative denoising processes, enabling automated data collection and scaling beyond supervised fine-tuning.

Method: Proposes π_RL framework with two RL algorithms: (1) Flow-Noise models denoising as discrete-time MDP with learnable noise network for exact log-likelihood computation, (2) Flow-SDE integrates denoising with agent-environment interaction using ODE-to-SDE conversion for efficient RL exploration.

Result: On LIBERO benchmark: improved π_0 from 57.6% to 97.6% and π_0.5 from 77.1% to 98.3%. On ManiSkill: trained in 320 parallel environments, improved π_0 from 41.6% to 85.7% and π_0.5 from 40.0% to 84.8% across 4352 pick-and-place tasks.

Conclusion: π_RL achieves significant performance gains and stronger generalization over SFT models, validating the effectiveness of online reinforcement learning for flow-based VLAs and demonstrating scalable multitask RL under heterogeneous simulation.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable robots to understand and perform
complex tasks from multimodal input. Although recent work explores using
reinforcement learning (RL) to automate the laborious data collection process
in scaling supervised fine-tuning (SFT), applying large-scale RL to flow-based
VLAs (e.g., $\pi_0$, $\pi_{0.5}$) remains challenging due to intractable action
log-likelihoods from iterative denoising.
  We address this challenge with $\pi_{\text{RL}}$, an open-source framework
for training flow-based VLAs in parallel simulation. $\pi_{\text{RL}}$
implements two RL algorithms: (1) {Flow-Noise} models the denoising process as
a discrete-time MDP with a learnable noise network for exact log-likelihood
computation. (2) {Flow-SDE} integrates denoising with agent-environment
interaction, formulating a two-layer MDP that employs ODE-to-SDE conversion for
efficient RL exploration.
  We evaluate $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ on LIBERO and ManiSkill benchmarks. On LIBERO,
$\pi_{\text{RL}}$ boosts few-shot SFT models $\pi_0$ and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 57.6%
to 97.6% and from 77.1% to 98.3%, respectively. In ManiSkill, we train
$\pi_{\text{RL}}$ in 320 parallel environments, improving $\pi_0$ from 41.6% to
85.7% and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 40.0% to 84.8% across 4352 pick-and-place tasks,
demonstrating scalable multitask RL under heterogeneous simulation.
  Overall, $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ achieves significant performance gains and
stronger generalization over SFT-models, validating the effectiveness of online
RL for flow-based VLAs.

*Harris Hardiman-Mostow,Jack Mauro,Adrien Weihs,Andrea L. Bertozzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A graph-topological active learning method using Balanced Forman Curvature for coreset construction and dynamic exploration-exploitation switching, with localized graph rewiring for improved label propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the core challenge of exploration versus exploitation under scarce label budgets in active learning, moving beyond hand-tuned heuristics.

Method: Uses Balanced Forman Curvature for coreset construction with data-driven stopping criterion, dynamically triggers exploration-exploitation shifts, and employs localized graph rewiring for multiscale information incorporation.

Result: Consistently outperforms existing graph-based semi-supervised baselines on benchmark classification tasks at low label rates.

Conclusion: The proposed graph-topological approach effectively handles exploration-exploitation trade-offs in active learning with limited labels through curvature-based methods and dynamic switching strategies.

Abstract: We propose a graph-topological approach to active learning that directly
targets the core challenge of exploration versus exploitation under scarce
label budgets. To guide exploration, we introduce a coreset construction
algorithm based on Balanced Forman Curvature (BFC), which selects
representative initial labels that reflect the graph's cluster structure. This
method includes a data-driven stopping criterion that signals when the graph
has been sufficiently explored. We further use BFC to dynamically trigger the
shift from exploration to exploitation within active learning routines,
replacing hand-tuned heuristics. To improve exploitation, we introduce a
localized graph rewiring strategy that efficiently incorporates multiscale
information around labeled nodes, enhancing label propagation while preserving
sparsity. Experiments on benchmark classification tasks show that our methods
consistently outperform existing graph-based semi-supervised baselines at low
label rates.

*Manuel Iglesias-Alonso,Felix Schur,Julius von Kügelgen,Jonas Peters*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses causal effect estimation in multi-domain settings with unobserved confounders, using proxy variables and proving identifiability even for continuous treatments and responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to estimate causal effects when confounders are unobserved and effects vary across domains, using proxy variables as a practical solution to this common challenge in causal inference.

Method: The authors propose methodology using proxy variables of hidden confounders, prove identifiability for continuous variables, introduce two estimation techniques with consistency proofs, and derive confidence intervals.

Result: Theoretical results are supported by simulation studies and a real-world application studying the causal effect of website rankings on consumer choices, demonstrating practical applicability.

Conclusion: The paper successfully develops a framework for estimating causal effects in multi-domain settings with unobserved confounders, providing both theoretical guarantees and empirical validation through simulations and real-world examples.

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating a causal effect in a multi-domain
setting. The causal effect of interest is confounded by an unobserved
confounder and can change between the different domains. We assume that we have
access to a proxy of the hidden confounder and that all variables are discrete
or categorical. We propose methodology to estimate the causal effect in the
target domain, where we assume to observe only the proxy variable. Under these
conditions, we prove identifiability (even when treatment and response
variables are continuous). We introduce two estimation techniques, prove
consistency, and derive confidence intervals. The theoretical results are
supported by simulation studies and a real-world example studying the causal
effect of website rankings on consumer choices.

### [72] [Active Learning with Task-Driven Representations for Messy Pools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25926)
*Kianoosh Ashouritaklimi,Tom Rainforth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using task-driven representations that are updated during active learning, rather than relying on fixed unsupervised representations, to better handle messy data pools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current active learning approaches use fixed unsupervised representations which fail to capture task-relevant information in messy, uncurated data pools, undermining their effectiveness.

Method: Two strategies for learning task-driven representations: 1) directly learning semi-supervised representations, and 2) supervised fine-tuning of initial unsupervised representations, both updated periodically during active learning.

Result: Both proposed strategies significantly improve empirical performance compared to using unsupervised or pretrained representations.

Conclusion: Periodically updating task-driven representations during active learning is more effective than using fixed representations for handling messy data pools.

Abstract: Active learning has the potential to be especially useful for messy,
uncurated pools where datapoints vary in relevance to the target task. However,
state-of-the-art approaches to this problem currently rely on using fixed,
unsupervised representations of the pool, focusing on modifying the acquisition
function instead. We show that this model setup can undermine their
effectiveness at dealing with messy pools, as such representations can fail to
capture important information relevant to the task. To address this, we propose
using task-driven representations that are periodically updated during the
active learning process using the previously collected labels. We introduce two
specific strategies for learning these representations, one based on directly
learning semi-supervised representations and the other based on supervised
fine-tuning of an initial unsupervised representation. We find that both
significantly improve empirical performance over using unsupervised or
pretrained representations.

*Jipeng Li,Yannning Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InvGNN-WM is a trigger-free watermarking method for Graph Neural Networks that ties ownership to the model's perception of graph invariants, enabling robust black-box verification with minimal impact on task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN watermarks using backdoor triggers are vulnerable to common model edits and create ownership ambiguity, necessitating a more robust and trigger-free approach.

Method: Uses a lightweight head to predict normalized algebraic connectivity on owner-private carrier sets, with sign-sensitive bit decoding and calibrated threshold control for false-positive rate management.

Result: Achieves comparable clean accuracy while providing higher watermark accuracy than trigger-based and compression-based baselines across diverse datasets and backbones, remaining robust under pruning, fine-tuning, and quantization.

Conclusion: InvGNN-WM provides provable guarantees for imperceptibility and robustness, with NP-complete exact removal, making it a secure and practical watermarking solution for GNN intellectual property protection.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are valuable intellectual property, yet many
watermarks rely on backdoor triggers that break under common model edits and
create ownership ambiguity. We present InvGNN-WM, which ties ownership to a
model's implicit perception of a graph invariant, enabling trigger-free,
black-box verification with negligible task impact. A lightweight head predicts
normalized algebraic connectivity on an owner-private carrier set; a
sign-sensitive decoder outputs bits, and a calibrated threshold controls the
false-positive rate. Across diverse node and graph classification datasets and
backbones, InvGNN-WM matches clean accuracy while yielding higher watermark
accuracy than trigger- and compression-based baselines. It remains strong under
unstructured pruning, fine-tuning, and post-training quantization; plain
knowledge distillation (KD) weakens the mark, while KD with a watermark loss
(KD+WM) restores it. We provide guarantees for imperceptibility and robustness,
and we prove that exact removal is NP-complete.

### [74] [Modular Linear Tokenization (MLT)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25952)
*Tcharlies Schmitz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MLT is a reversible, deterministic encoding method for high-cardinality categorical data using modular arithmetic and linear transformations, offering compact vector representations with full reversibility and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional categorical encoding methods like hashing or one-hot encodings lack reversibility and bijective properties, making them unsuitable for applications requiring exact reconstruction of original identifiers from encoded vectors.

Method: Leverages modular arithmetic over finite fields and invertible linear transformations to create deterministic, bijective mappings between categorical identifiers and numerical vectors while controlling dimensionality.

Result: On MovieLens 20M dataset, MLT achieves comparable predictive performance to supervised embeddings with significantly fewer parameters and lower training costs, while maintaining full reversibility for millions of identifiers.

Conclusion: MLT provides an efficient, scalable alternative to traditional categorical encoding methods, offering explicit dimensionality control, computational scalability, and full reversibility while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: This paper introduces Modular Linear Tokenization (MLT), a reversible and
deterministic technique for encoding high-cardinality categorical identifiers
into compact numerical vectors. Unlike traditional hashing or one-hot
encodings, MLT preserves bijective mappings by leveraging modular arithmetic
over finite fields and invertible linear transformations. The method offers
explicit control of dimensionality and computational scalability while
maintaining full reversibility, even for millions of identifiers. Experimental
results on the MovieLens 20M dataset show that MLT achieves comparable
predictive performance to supervised embeddings while requiring significantly
fewer parameters and lower training cost. An open-source implementation of MLT
is available on PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/light-mlt/) and GitHub

TL;DR: GeoFM embeddings improve health outcome predictions in Malawi compared to traditional methods, with multi-source integration showing the best performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address reliability issues in routine health data from LMICs by exploring novel data sources like GeoFMs that can synthesize diverse spatial, temporal, and behavioral data.

Method: Evaluated three GeoFM embedding sources (Google PDFM, AlphaEarth, mobile CDR) using XGBoost models on 552 health catchment areas with 80/20 train-test split and 5-fold cross-validation for 15 health indicators.

Result: Embedding-based approaches outperformed baseline methods in 13 of 15 indicators. Multi-GeoFM model achieved best performance with R² values up to 0.68 for health outcomes like HIV cases and vaccinations.

Conclusion: GeoFM embeddings provide modest predictive improvements for health outcomes in LMICs, and integrating multiple GeoFM sources is valuable for strengthening constrained health information systems.

Abstract: The reliability of routine health data in low and middle-income countries
(LMICs) is often constrained by reporting delays and incomplete coverage,
necessitating the exploration of novel data sources and analytics. Geospatial
Foundation Models (GeoFMs) offer a promising avenue by synthesizing diverse
spatial, temporal, and behavioral data into mathematical embeddings that can be
efficiently used for downstream prediction tasks. This study evaluated the
predictive performance of three GeoFM embedding sources - Google Population
Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM), Google AlphaEarth (derived from satellite
imagery), and mobile phone call detail records (CDR) - for modeling 15 routine
health programmatic outputs in Malawi, and compared their utility to
traditional geospatial interpolation methods. We used XGBoost models on data
from 552 health catchment areas (January 2021-May 2023), assessing performance
with R2, and using an 80/20 training and test data split with 5-fold
cross-validation used in training. While predictive performance was mixed, the
embedding-based approaches improved upon baseline geostatistical methods in 13
of 15 (87%) indicators tested. A Multi-GeoFM model integrating all three
embedding sources produced the most robust predictions, achieving average
5-fold cross validated R2 values for indicators like population density (0.63),
new HIV cases (0.57), and child vaccinations (0.47) and test set R2 of 0.64,
0.68, and 0.55, respectively. Prediction was poor for prediction targets with
low primary data availability, such as TB and malnutrition cases. These results
demonstrate that GeoFM embeddings imbue a modest predictive improvement for
select health and demographic outcomes in an LMIC context. We conclude that the
integration of multiple GeoFM sources is an efficient and valuable tool for
supplementing and strengthening constrained routine health information systems.

*Alvaro Velasquez,Susmit Jha,Ismail R. Alkhouri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Survey of neural networks for optimization without training data, categorizing methods into architecture-agnostic and architecture-specific approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data-driven learning approaches are underdeveloped in some domains like combinatorial optimization, and training data availability is limited in applications like medical image reconstruction.

Method: Re-parameterizing optimization problems using neural network architectures (MLP, convolutional, graph, quadratic) and categorizing into two variants based on problem instance encoding.

Result: The approach has gained recent attention due to promising results across diverse applications including combinatorial optimization, inverse problems, and PDEs.

Conclusion: The paper defines the dataless neural network setting and clarifies its distinctions from related concepts like zero-shot learning and over-parameterization.

Abstract: This paper surveys studies on the use of neural networks for optimization in
the training-data-free setting. Specifically, we examine the dataless
application of neural network architectures in optimization by
re-parameterizing problems using fully connected (or MLP), convolutional,
graph, and quadratic neural networks. Although MLPs have been used to solve
linear programs a few decades ago, this approach has recently gained increasing
attention due to its promising results across diverse applications, including
those based on combinatorial optimization, inverse problems, and partial
differential equations. The motivation for this setting stems from two key
(possibly over-lapping) factors: (i) data-driven learning approaches are still
underdeveloped and have yet to demonstrate strong results, as seen in
combinatorial optimization, and (ii) the availability of training data is
inherently limited, such as in medical image reconstruction and other
scientific applications. In this paper, we define the dataless setting and
categorize it into two variants based on how a problem instance -- defined by a
single datum -- is encoded onto the neural network: (i) architecture-agnostic
methods and (ii) architecture-specific methods. Additionally, we discuss
similarities and clarify distinctions between the dataless neural network (dNN)
settings and related concepts such as zero-shot learning, one-shot learning,
lifting in optimization, and over-parameterization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InfoNCE is not a valid MI estimator. The paper introduces InfoNCE-anchor with an auxiliary anchor class for accurate MI estimation, and generalizes the framework using proper scoring rules. While InfoNCE-anchor improves MI estimation accuracy, it doesn't enhance downstream task performance in representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: InfoNCE has become popular for mutual information estimation despite its indirect connection to MI. The authors aim to demonstrate why InfoNCE is not a valid MI estimator and introduce a modification for accurate MI estimation.

Method: Introduce InfoNCE-anchor with an auxiliary anchor class for consistent density ratio estimation. Generalize the framework using proper scoring rules, which recovers InfoNCE-anchor as a special case with log score.

Result: InfoNCE-anchor with log score achieves the most accurate MI estimates. However, in self-supervised representation learning, the anchor does not improve downstream task performance.

Conclusion: Contrastive representation learning benefits from learning structured density ratios rather than accurate MI estimation per se.

Abstract: The InfoNCE objective, originally introduced for contrastive representation
learning, has become a popular choice for mutual information (MI) estimation,
despite its indirect connection to MI. In this paper, we demonstrate why
InfoNCE should not be regarded as a valid MI estimator, and we introduce a
simple modification, which we refer to as InfoNCE-anchor, for accurate MI
estimation. Our modification introduces an auxiliary anchor class, enabling
consistent density ratio estimation and yielding a plug-in MI estimator with
significantly reduced bias. Beyond this, we generalize our framework using
proper scoring rules, which recover InfoNCE-anchor as a special case when the
log score is employed. This formulation unifies a broad spectrum of contrastive
objectives, including NCE, InfoNCE, and $f$-divergence variants, under a single
principled framework. Empirically, we find that InfoNCE-anchor with the log
score achieves the most accurate MI estimates; however, in self-supervised
representation learning experiments, we find that the anchor does not improve
the downstream task performance. These findings corroborate that contrastive
representation learning benefits not from accurate MI estimation per se, but
from the learning of structured density ratios.

TL;DR: DiffOpt.jl is a Julia framework that unifies optimization modeling and differentiation, computing forward- and reverse-mode sensitivities for smooth programs by differentiating KKT systems, with a parameter-centric API that eliminates manual bookkeeping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical integration of differentiable optimization remains challenging due to solver specialization and interface mismatches, despite its importance for learning, control, and large-scale decision-making systems.

Method: Differentiates the KKT system under standard regularity assumptions to compute forward- and reverse-mode solution and objective sensitivities for smooth programs. Uses a parameter-centric API in JuMP that allows declaring named parameters and obtaining derivatives directly with respect to them.

Result: Successfully applied to convex and nonconvex models including economic dispatch, mean-variance portfolio selection with conic risk constraints, and nonlinear robot inverse kinematics. Companion studies demonstrate gradient-based iterative methods for strategic bidding and Sobolev-style training of optimization proxies.

Conclusion: Differentiable optimization can be deployed as a routine tool for experimentation, learning, calibration, and design without deviating from standard JuMP modeling practices while retaining access to a broad solver ecosystem.

Abstract: Differentiating through constrained optimization problems is increasingly
central to learning, control, and large-scale decision-making systems, yet
practical integration remains challenging due to solver specialization and
interface mismatches. This paper presents a general and streamlined
framework-an updated DiffOpt.jl-that unifies modeling and differentiation
within the Julia optimization stack. The framework computes forward - and
reverse-mode solution and objective sensitivities for smooth, potentially
nonconvex programs by differentiating the KKT system under standard regularity
assumptions. A first-class, JuMP-native parameter-centric API allows users to
declare named parameters and obtain derivatives directly with respect to them -
even when a parameter appears in multiple constraints and objectives -
eliminating brittle bookkeeping from coefficient-level interfaces. We
illustrate these capabilities on convex and nonconvex models, including
economic dispatch, mean-variance portfolio selection with conic risk
constraints, and nonlinear robot inverse kinematics. Two companion studies
further demonstrate impact at scale: gradient-based iterative methods for
strategic bidding in energy markets and Sobolev-style training of end-to-end
optimization proxies using solver-accurate sensitivities. Together, these
results demonstrate that differentiable optimization can be deployed as a
routine tool for experimentation, learning, calibration, and design-without
deviating from standard JuMP modeling practices and while retaining access to a
broad ecosystem of solvers.

TL;DR: PCN-TA is a biologically plausible predictive coding network that reduces computational overhead by preserving latent states across temporal frames, achieving 10% fewer weight updates than backpropagation and 50% fewer inference steps than baseline PC networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic systems at the edge need efficient online learning algorithms that can continuously adapt to changing environments. Traditional backpropagation conflicts with biological plausibility and may be suboptimal for continuous adaptation, while predictive coding offers a biologically plausible alternative but suffers from computational overhead.

Method: Predictive Coding Network with Temporal Amortization (PCN-TA) preserves latent states across temporal frames to leverage temporal correlations, significantly reducing computational demands while maintaining learning performance.

Result: Experiments on COIL-20 robotic perception dataset show PCN-TA achieves 10% fewer weight updates compared to backpropagation and requires 50% fewer inference steps than baseline PC networks.

Conclusion: PCN-TA's efficiency gains enable reduced computational overhead for edge deployment and real-time adaptation in resource-constrained robotic systems, while its biologically-inspired nature makes it promising for future neuromorphic hardware implementations.

Abstract: Robotic systems operating at the edge require efficient online learning
algorithms that can continuously adapt to changing environments while
processing streaming sensory data. Traditional backpropagation, while
effective, conflicts with biological plausibility principles and may be
suboptimal for continuous adaptation scenarios. The Predictive Coding (PC)
framework offers a biologically plausible alternative with local, Hebbian-like
update rules, making it suitable for neuromorphic hardware implementation.
However, PC's main limitation is its computational overhead due to multiple
inference iterations during training. We present Predictive Coding Network with
Temporal Amortization (PCN-TA), which preserves latent states across temporal
frames. By leveraging temporal correlations, PCN-TA significantly reduces
computational demands while maintaining learning performance. Our experiments
on the COIL-20 robotic perception dataset demonstrate that PCN-TA achieves 10%
fewer weight updates compared to backpropagation and requires 50% fewer
inference steps than baseline PC networks. These efficiency gains directly
translate to reduced computational overhead for moving another step toward edge
deployment and real-time adaptation support in resource-constrained robotic
systems. The biologically-inspired nature of our approach also makes it a
promising candidate for future neuromorphic hardware implementations, enabling
efficient online learning at the edge.

TL;DR: INFEX is a framework for infrequent exploration in linear bandits that balances between continuous exploration and purely greedy approaches, achieving efficient regret with reduced exploration frequency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between fully adaptive exploration methods (which explore constantly) and purely greedy approaches (which require strong diversity assumptions), particularly for safety-critical or costly domains where continuous exploration is impractical.

Method: INFEX executes a base exploratory policy according to a predetermined schedule while using greedy actions in between exploration phases, allowing integration of any adaptive exploration method.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows INFEX achieves instance-dependent regret matching standard efficient algorithms when exploration frequency exceeds a logarithmic threshold. Empirical evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art regret performance and runtime improvements.

Conclusion: INFEX provides a practical, modular framework for infrequent exploration that maintains theoretical guarantees while reducing computational overhead and exploration frequency, making it suitable for real-world applications where continuous exploration is undesirable.

Abstract: We study the problem of infrequent exploration in linear bandits, addressing
a significant yet overlooked gap between fully adaptive exploratory methods
(e.g., UCB and Thompson Sampling), which explore potentially at every time
step, and purely greedy approaches, which require stringent diversity
assumptions to succeed. Continuous exploration can be impractical or unethical
in safety-critical or costly domains, while purely greedy strategies typically
fail without adequate contextual diversity. To bridge these extremes, we
introduce a simple and practical framework, INFEX, explicitly designed for
infrequent exploration. INFEX executes a base exploratory policy according to a
given schedule while predominantly choosing greedy actions in between. Despite
its simplicity, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that INFEX achieves
instance-dependent regret matching standard provably efficient algorithms,
provided the exploration frequency exceeds a logarithmic threshold.
Additionally, INFEX is a general, modular framework that allows seamless
integration of any fully adaptive exploration method, enabling wide
applicability and ease of adoption. By restricting intensive exploratory
computations to infrequent intervals, our approach can also enhance
computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations confirm our theoretical
findings, showing state-of-the-art regret performance and runtime improvements
over existing methods.

Motivation: To address the challenge of modeling patient heterogeneity while adapting risk predictions to individual characteristics and temporal dynamics in survival analysis, particularly in clinical and biomedical research.

Method: Proposes a dual mixture-of-experts framework with two components: a feature-encoder MoE for subgroup-aware representation learning and a hazard MoE that uses patient features and time embeddings to capture temporal dynamics. The design flexibly integrates with existing deep learning survival pipelines.

Result: On METABRIC and GBSG breast cancer datasets, the method consistently improved performance, boosting the time-dependent C-index up to 0.04 on test sets, with additional gains when incorporated into the Consurv framework.

Conclusion: The dual MoE framework effectively models patient heterogeneity and temporal dynamics in survival analysis, demonstrating improved performance on breast cancer datasets and compatibility with existing survival analysis pipelines.

Abstract: Survival analysis is a task to model the time until an event of interest
occurs, widely used in clinical and biomedical research. A key challenge is to
model patient heterogeneity while also adapting risk predictions to both
individual characteristics and temporal dynamics. We propose a dual

approach combines a feature-encoder MoE for subgroup-aware representation
learning with a hazard MoE that leverages patient features and time embeddings
to capture temporal dynamics. This dual-MoE design flexibly integrates with
existing deep learning based survival pipelines. On METABRIC and GBSG breast
cancer datasets, our method consistently improves performance, boosting the
time-dependent C-index up to 0.04 on the test sets, and yields further gains
when incorporated into the Consurv framework.

TL;DR: A study of a chess-playing AI transformer reveals a paradox: early layers encode human strategic concepts well, but deeper layers that drive superior performance develop alien representations that diverge from human thinking. Testing with Chess960 shows the model relies on memorized patterns rather than abstract understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether AI systems truly understand human concepts or merely mimic surface patterns, using chess as a domain where human creativity meets precise strategic concepts.

Method: Analyzed a 270M-parameter transformer achieving grandmaster-level play through layer-wise analysis of concept encoding, and introduced the first Chess960 dataset with 240 expert-annotated positions across 6 strategic concepts to test conceptual robustness beyond memorization.

Result: Early layers encoded human concepts like center control and knight outposts with 85% accuracy, but deeper layers dropped to 50-65% accuracy despite driving superior performance. When opening theory was eliminated via Chess960, concept recognition dropped 10-20%, revealing reliance on memorized patterns.

Conclusion: Current AI architectures face a fundamental tension: representations that optimize for performance diverge from those aligning with human thinking, suggesting AI systems develop increasingly alien intelligence as they optimize, posing challenges for genuine human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Do AI systems truly understand human concepts or merely mimic surface
patterns? We investigate this through chess, where human creativity meets
precise strategic concepts. Analyzing a 270M-parameter transformer that
achieves grandmaster-level play, we uncover a striking paradox: while early
layers encode human concepts like center control and knight outposts with up to
85\% accuracy, deeper layers, despite driving superior performance, drift
toward alien representations, dropping to 50-65\% accuracy. To test conceptual
robustness beyond memorization, we introduce the first Chess960 dataset: 240
expert-annotated positions across 6 strategic concepts. When opening theory is
eliminated through randomized starting positions, concept recognition drops
10-20\% across all methods, revealing the model's reliance on memorized
patterns rather than abstract understanding. Our layer-wise analysis exposes a

### [83] [Do Students Debias Like Teachers? On the Distillability of Bias Mitigation Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26038)
*Jiali Cheng,Chirag Agarwal,Hadi Amiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Knowledge distillation undermines debiasing capabilities in models, with significant variations across bias types, and attention patterns reveal the underlying mechanisms. Three solutions are proposed to improve debiasing distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how knowledge distillation affects model robustness against spurious correlations and the transferability of debiasing capabilities from teacher to student models.

Method: Extensive experiments on natural language inference and image classification tasks, analyzing attention patterns and internal circuits that cause distinct behavior post-KD.

Result: KD generally undermines debiasing capabilities; training debiased models doesn't benefit from teacher knowledge; robustness varies significantly across bias types; attention patterns reveal internal mechanisms.

Conclusion: First study on KD's effect on debiasing at scale, providing insights for designing better debiasing methods and proposing three effective solutions: high-quality data augmentation, iterative KD, and teacher-initialized student weights.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for model compression and
transferring knowledge between models. However, its effect on model's
robustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on
out-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the
effect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''
capabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language
inference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,
we illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a
model is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit
from injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a
model may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur
across different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention
pattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above
findings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of
debiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing
iterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights
obtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.
Our findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better
debiasing methods.

*David Otte,Jörg K. H. Franke,Frank Hutter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents the first systematic investigation of scaling laws in symbolic regression (SR), showing that both validation loss and solved rate follow power-law trends with compute, similar to scaling laws in language modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symbolic regression aims to discover mathematical expressions from data for scientific insight and interpretable models. While deep learning-based SR has become competitive with genetic programming, the role of scale remained unexplored, inspiring this study based on scaling laws from language modeling.

Method: Used a scalable end-to-end transformer pipeline with carefully generated training data, testing across five different model sizes spanning three orders of magnitude in compute. Investigated compute-optimal hyperparameter scaling including batch size, learning rate, and token-to-parameter ratios.

Result: Found clear power-law trends between compute and both validation loss and solved rate. Identified optimal hyperparameter scaling: batch size and learning rate grow with model size, optimal token-to-parameter ratio is ≈15 with slight upward trend as compute increases.

Conclusion: SR performance is largely predictable from compute, providing important insights for training next-generation SR models and demonstrating that scaling laws apply to symbolic regression similar to language modeling.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover the underlying mathematical
expressions that explain observed data. This holds promise for both gaining
scientific insight and for producing inherently interpretable and generalizable
models for tabular data. In this work we focus on the basics of SR. Deep
learning-based SR has recently become competitive with genetic programming
approaches, but the role of scale has remained largely unexplored. Inspired by
scaling laws in language modeling, we present the first systematic
investigation of scaling in SR, using a scalable end-to-end transformer
pipeline and carefully generated training data. Across five different model
sizes and spanning three orders of magnitude in compute, we find that both
validation loss and solved rate follow clear power-law trends with compute. We
further identify compute-optimal hyperparameter scaling: optimal batch size and
learning rate grow with model size, and a token-to-parameter ratio of
$\approx$15 is optimal in our regime, with a slight upward trend as compute
increases. These results demonstrate that SR performance is largely predictable
from compute and offer important insights for training the next generation of
SR models.

### [85] [Learning Geometry: A Framework for Building Adaptive Manifold Models through Metric Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26068)
*Di Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel machine learning paradigm that treats models as malleable geometric entities by optimizing metric tensor fields on manifolds, balancing data fidelity with geometric complexity through a variational framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond traditional parameter optimization by dynamically shaping the geometric structure of model spaces, enabling more expressive models and preventing overfitting through geometric regularization.

Method: Constructs a variational framework with loss balancing data fidelity and geometric complexity, discretizes continuous manifolds into triangular meshes, parameterizes metric tensor by edge lengths, and uses automatic differentiation for efficient optimization.

Result: Theoretical analysis reveals analogy with Einstein-Hilbert action in general relativity, demonstrating greater expressive power than fixed-geometry models even with fixed topology.

Conclusion: This work establishes foundation for dynamic meta-learners that autonomously evolve geometry and topology, with broad applications in scientific model discovery and robust representation learning.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel paradigm for machine learning that moves beyond
traditional parameter optimization. Unlike conventional approaches that search
for optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to
treat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we
optimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology,
thereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To
achieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function
carefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of
the manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data,
while the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular
geometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the
computational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we
introduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the
continuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric
tensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using
automatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound
analogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general
relativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of
"data-driven geometry". We further argue that even with fixed topology, metric
optimization offers significantly greater expressive power than models with
fixed geometry. This work lays a solid foundation for constructing fully
dynamic "meta-learners" capable of autonomously evolving their geometry and
topology, and it points to broad application prospects in areas such as
scientific model discovery and robust representation learning.

TL;DR: This systematic review analyzes 72 studies on synthetic financial data generation using GANs and VAEs, finding GAN-based approaches dominate for market and credit data, with gaps in privacy evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges of using sensitive financial data in ML by generating synthetic data that preserves statistical properties while mitigating privacy risks and regulatory constraints.

Method: Systematic review of 72 studies published since 2018, categorizing types of financial information synthesized, generative methods employed, and evaluation strategies for data utility and privacy.

Result: GAN-based approaches dominate the literature, particularly for time-series market data and tabular credit data. Several innovative techniques show potential but lack rigorous privacy evaluation.

Conclusion: The review provides integrated overview of generative techniques and highlights critical research gaps, offering guidance for developing robust, privacy-preserving synthetic data solutions for finance.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising approach to address the
challenges of using sensitive financial data in machine learning applications.
By leveraging generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), it is possible to create artificial
datasets that preserve the statistical properties of real financial records
while mitigating privacy risks and regulatory constraints. Despite the rapid
growth of this field, a comprehensive synthesis of the current research
landscape has been lacking. This systematic review consolidates and analyses 72
studies published since 2018 that focus on synthetic financial data generation.
We categorise the types of financial information synthesised, the generative
methods employed, and the evaluation strategies used to assess data utility and
privacy. The findings indicate that GAN-based approaches dominate the
literature, particularly for generating time-series market data and tabular
credit data. While several innovative techniques demonstrate potential for
improved realism and privacy preservation, there remains a notable lack of
rigorous evaluation of privacy safeguards across studies. By providing an
integrated overview of generative techniques, applications, and evaluation
methods, this review highlights critical research gaps and offers guidance for
future work aimed at developing robust, privacy-preserving synthetic data
solutions for the financial domain.

### [87] [Nirvana: A Specialized Generalist Model With Task-Aware Memory Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26083)
*Yuhua Jiang,Shuang Cheng,Yihao Liu,Ermo Hua,Che Jiang,Weigao Sun,Yu Cheng,Feifei Gao,Biqing Qi,Bowen Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Nirvana is a Specialized Generalist Model with specialized memory mechanism, linear time complexity, and test-time task information extraction. It uses Task-Aware Memory Trigger and Specialized Memory Updater to adapt to domain shifts and achieve expert-level performance while preserving broad capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LLM structures lack specialized memory mechanisms guided by task information, limiting their ability to achieve expert-level performance in target domains while maintaining broad capabilities.

Method: Proposed Nirvana with Task-Aware Memory Trigger that treats each incoming sample as self-supervised fine-tuning task, and Specialized Memory Updater that dynamically memorizes context guided by Trigger. Features linear time complexity and test-time task information extraction.

Result: Achieves competitive/superior results on natural language modeling benchmarks. On MRI reconstruction task, achieves higher-quality reconstruction compared to conventional MRI models and traditional LLM backbones, and generates accurate preliminary clinical reports.

Conclusion: Nirvana effectively bridges the gap between general capabilities and specialized performance through its task-aware memory mechanism, demonstrating strong performance across both general language tasks and specialized medical domains.

Abstract: Specialized Generalist Models (SGMs) aim to preserve broad capabilities while
achieving expert-level performance in target domains. However, traditional LLM
structures including Transformer, Linear Attention, and hybrid models do not
employ specialized memory mechanism guided by task information. In this paper,
we present Nirvana, an SGM with specialized memory mechanism, linear time
complexity, and test-time task information extraction. Besides, we propose the
Task-Aware Memory Trigger ($\textit{Trigger}$) that flexibly adjusts memory
mechanism based on the current task's requirements. In Trigger, each incoming
sample is treated as a self-supervised fine-tuning task, enabling Nirvana to
adapt its task-related parameters on the fly to domain shifts. We also design
the Specialized Memory Updater ($\textit{Updater}$) that dynamically memorizes
the context guided by Trigger. We conduct experiments on both general language
tasks and specialized medical tasks. On a variety of natural language modeling
benchmarks, Nirvana achieves competitive or superior results compared to the
existing LLM structures. To prove the effectiveness of Trigger on specialized
tasks, we test Nirvana's performance on a challenging medical task, i.e.,
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). We post-train frozen Nirvana backbone with
lightweight codecs on paired electromagnetic signals and MRI images. Despite
the frozen Nirvana backbone, Trigger guides the model to adapt to the MRI
domain with the change of task-related parameters. Nirvana achieves
higher-quality MRI reconstruction compared to conventional MRI models as well
as the models with traditional LLMs' backbone, and can also generate accurate
preliminary clinical reports accordingly.

### [88] [LLMBisect: Breaking Barriers in Bug Bisection with A Comparative Analysis Pipeline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26086)
*Zheng Zhang,Haonan Li,Xingyu Li,Hang Zhang,Zhiyun Qian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multi-stage LLM-based pipeline for bug bisection that significantly outperforms traditional patch-based methods by leveraging both code and textual information from commits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional patch-based bisection methods face barriers like assuming bug-inducing and patch commits modify the same functions, relying only on code changes while ignoring commit messages, and using simple heuristics without logical vulnerability analysis.

Method: A comprehensive multi-stage pipeline using LLMs that: (1) fully utilizes patch information, (2) compares multiple candidate commits in context, and (3) progressively narrows down candidates through down-selection steps.

Result: The approach achieves significantly better accuracy than state-of-the-art solutions by more than 38%, and the multi-stage pipeline improves accuracy by 60% over baseline LLM-based bisection methods.

Conclusion: LLMs are well-positioned to break barriers of existing bug bisection solutions by comprehending both textual data and code, and the proposed multi-stage pipeline is essential for achieving high accuracy in identifying bug-inducing commits.

Abstract: Bug bisection has been an important security task that aims to understand the
range of software versions impacted by a bug, i.e., identifying the commit that
introduced the bug. However, traditional patch-based bisection methods are
faced with several significant barriers: For example, they assume that the
bug-inducing commit (BIC) and the patch commit modify the same functions, which
is not always true. They often rely solely on code changes, while the commit
message frequently contains a wealth of vulnerability-related information. They
are also based on simple heuristics (e.g., assuming the BIC initializes lines
deleted in the patch) and lack any logical analysis of the vulnerability.
  In this paper, we make the observation that Large Language Models (LLMs) are
well-positioned to break the barriers of existing solutions, e.g., comprehend
both textual data and code in patches and commits. Unlike previous BIC
identification approaches, which yield poor results, we propose a comprehensive
multi-stage pipeline that leverages LLMs to: (1) fully utilize patch
information, (2) compare multiple candidate commits in context, and (3)
progressively narrow down the candidates through a series of down-selection
steps. In our evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves
significantly better accuracy than the state-of-the-art solution by more than
38\%. Our results further confirm that the comprehensive multi-stage pipeline
is essential, as it improves accuracy by 60\% over a baseline LLM-based
bisection method.

### [89] [Network-Constrained Policy Optimization for Adaptive Multi-agent Vehicle Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26089)
*Fazel Arasteh,Arian Haghparast,Manos Papagelis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes two multi-agent reinforcement learning approaches for dynamic vehicle routing to reduce traffic congestion. AN uses decentralized intersection agents with Graph Attention Networks, while HHAN extends this with hierarchical hub-based routing for scalability in large networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional shortest path algorithms perform poorly in dynamic multi-vehicle settings by routing all vehicles along identical paths, worsening congestion. There's a need for coordinated, network-aware fleet navigation that can adapt to real-time traffic conditions.

Method: Two approaches: (1) Adaptive Navigation (AN) - decentralized MARL with intersection agents using Graph Attention Networks for local traffic and neighborhood state modeling; (2) Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation (HHAN) - assigns agents only to key hubs with centralized training/decentralized execution using Attentive Q-Mixing framework.

Result: Experiments on synthetic grids and real urban maps show AN reduces average travel time versus SPF while maintaining 100% routing success. HHAN scales to networks with hundreds of intersections, achieving up to 15.9% improvement under heavy traffic conditions.

Conclusion: Network-constrained MARL enables scalable, coordinated, and congestion-aware routing for intelligent transportation systems, with hierarchical approaches providing effective solutions for large urban networks.

Abstract: Traffic congestion in urban road networks leads to longer trip times and
higher emissions, especially during peak periods. While the Shortest Path First
(SPF) algorithm is optimal for a single vehicle in a static network, it
performs poorly in dynamic, multi-vehicle settings, often worsening congestion
by routing all vehicles along identical paths. We address dynamic vehicle
routing through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for
coordinated, network-aware fleet navigation. We first propose Adaptive
Navigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent
provides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood
state modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in
large networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation
(HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections
(hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles
micro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts
centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive
Q-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions
via attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local
congestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing. Experiments on
synthetic grids and real urban maps (Toronto, Manhattan) show that AN reduces
average travel time versus SPF and learning baselines, maintaining 100% routing
success. HHAN scales to networks with hundreds of intersections, achieving up
to 15.9% improvement under heavy traffic. These findings highlight the
potential of network-constrained MARL for scalable, coordinated, and
congestion-aware routing in intelligent transportation systems.

*Nick Masi,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAFE is a package for assessing weather forecast model performance across different geographic and socioeconomic strata rather than using global averages, revealing performance disparities across countries, regions, income levels, and landcover types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning approaches assess model performance using global averages, which fails to account for the non-uniform distribution of human development and geography, potentially masking performance disparities across different regions and populations.

Method: Developed SAFE package that integrates various data domains to stratify geospatial gridpoints by territory (country), global subregion, income, and landcover. This enables examination of model performance for each individual stratum rather than relying on global averages.

Result: Benchmarked state-of-the-art AI weather prediction models using SAFE and found that all models exhibit disparities in forecasting skill across every attribute (territory, subregion, income, landcover). Established a benchmark for model forecast fairness through stratification at different lead times for various climatic variables.

Conclusion: SAFE enables moving beyond globally-averaged metrics to identify where models perform best/worst and which models are most fair. The package is open source to support further work in assessing model performance disparities across different geographic and socioeconomic contexts.

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in machine learning is to assess model performance
based on average loss across all samples in some test set. This amounts to
averaging performance geospatially across the Earth in weather and climate
settings, failing to account for the non-uniform distribution of human
development and geography. We introduce Stratified Assessments of Forecasts
over Earth (SAFE), a package for elucidating the stratified performance of a
set of predictions made over Earth. SAFE integrates various data domains to
stratify by different attributes associated with geospatial gridpoints:
territory (usually country), global subregion, income, and landcover (land or
water). This allows us to examine the performance of models for each individual
stratum of the different attributes (e.g., the accuracy in every individual
country). To demonstrate its importance, we utilize SAFE to benchmark a zoo of
state-of-the-art AI-based weather prediction models, finding that they all
exhibit disparities in forecasting skill across every attribute. We use this to
seed a benchmark of model forecast fairness through stratification at different
lead times for various climatic variables. By moving beyond globally-averaged
metrics, we for the first time ask: where do models perform best or worst, and
which models are most fair? To support further work in this direction, the SAFE
package is open source and available at https://github.com/N-Masi/safe

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LTE (Learning to reason from Trial and Error) is a new RLVR approach that enhances LLM reasoning by using self-generated incorrect answers and overlong responses as hints, without requiring external expert guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR approaches are constrained by LLMs' initial capabilities and suffer from exploration stagnation, where models fail to solve more training problems and cannot further learn. Current solutions require external expert guidance which has limited availability.

Method: LTE hints LLMs with their previously self-generated incorrect answers and problems of overlong responses during training, enabling learning from trial and error without external expert guidance.

Result: LTE outperforms normal group relative policy optimization (GRPO) by 6.38 in Pass@1 and 9.00 in Pass@k on average across six mathematics benchmarks for Qwen3-4B-Base. It successfully mitigates exploration stagnation and enhances both exploitation and exploration during training.

Conclusion: LTE is an effective RLVR approach that addresses exploration stagnation by leveraging self-generated incorrect responses, improving reasoning capabilities without requiring external expert guidance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has significantly
boosted the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) recently.
However, existing RLVR approaches merely train LLMs based on their own
generated responses and are constrained by the initial capability of LLMs, thus
prone to exploration stagnation, in which LLMs fail to solve more training
problems and cannot further learn from the training data. Some work tries to
address this by leveraging off-policy solutions to training problems but
requires external guidance from experts which suffers from limited
availability. In this work, we propose LTE (Learning to reason from Trial and
Error), an approach hinting LLMs with their previously self-generated incorrect
answers and problem of overlong responses, which does not require any external
expert guidance. Experiments validate the effectiveness of LTE, which
outperforms the normal group relative policy optimization (GRPO) by 6.38 in
Pass@1 and 9.00 in Pass@k on average across six mathematics benchmarks for
Qwen3-4B-Base. Further analysis confirms that LTE successfully mitigates the
problem of exploration stagnation and enhances both exploitation and
exploration during training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shift in WiFi CSI-based HAR severely degrades performance on edge devices under varying environmental conditions, requiring a solution that can autonomously adapt without manual intervention while preserving privacy.

Method: A closed-loop teacher-student architecture where a YOLO-based vision model provides real-time activity labels to fine-tune a lightweight CSI-based HAR model (STAR) directly at the edge, enabling continuous adaptation to environmental changes.

Result: After domain shift, baseline STAR accuracy dropped from 93.52% to 49.14%, but maxVSTAR restored it to 81.51% after one adaptation cycle on uncalibrated hardware.

Conclusion: maxVSTAR enables dynamic, self-supervised model adaptation for privacy-conscious IoT environments, establishing a scalable paradigm for long-term autonomous HAR using CSI sensing at the network edge.

Abstract: WiFi Channel State Information (CSI)-based human activity recognition (HAR)
provides a privacy-preserving, device-free sensing solution for smart
environments. However, its deployment on edge devices is severely constrained
by domain shift, where recognition performance deteriorates under varying
environmental and hardware conditions. This study presents maxVSTAR (maximally
adaptive Vision-guided Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), a
closed-loop, vision-guided model adaptation framework that autonomously
mitigates domain shift for edge-deployed CSI sensing systems. The proposed
system integrates a cross-modal teacher-student architecture, where a
high-accuracy YOLO-based vision model serves as a dynamic supervisory signal,
delivering real-time activity labels for the CSI data stream. These labels
enable autonomous, online fine-tuning of a lightweight CSI-based HAR model,
termed Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition (STAR), directly at the
edge. This closed-loop retraining mechanism allows STAR to continuously adapt
to environmental changes without manual intervention. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of maxVSTAR. When deployed on uncalibrated
hardware, the baseline STAR model's recognition accuracy declined from 93.52%
to 49.14%. Following a single vision-guided adaptation cycle, maxVSTAR restored
the accuracy to 81.51%. These results confirm the system's capacity for
dynamic, self-supervised model adaptation in privacy-conscious IoT
environments, establishing a scalable and practical paradigm for long-term
autonomous HAR using CSI sensing at the network edge.

Conclusion: STAR provides a practical, scalable solution for real-time, privacy-preserving HAR with sub-second latency and low power consumption, suitable for mobile and pervasive computing environments.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) via Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI)
presents a privacy-preserving, contactless sensing approach suitable for smart

This paper proposes STAR (Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), an

real-time, energy-efficient HAR on low-power embedded devices. STAR
incorporates a streamlined Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based recurrent neural

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle to capture subtle differences between molecules and their descriptions due to inability to learn fine-grained alignments between molecular substructures and chemical phrases.

Method: Augments molecule-description pairs with alignment signals from molecular substructures and chemical phrases, uses substructure-aware contrastive learning with self-refinement mechanism to filter noisy alignment signals.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on a wide range of molecular benchmarks, effectively captures fine-grained correspondences between molecules and text.

Conclusion: Substructure-aware alignment is significant for molecule-text learning, and MolBridge demonstrates effective fine-grained correspondence capture.

Abstract: Molecule and text representation learning has gained increasing interest due
to its potential for enhancing the understanding of chemical information.
However, existing models often struggle to capture subtle differences between
molecules and their descriptions, as they lack the ability to learn
fine-grained alignments between molecular substructures and chemical phrases.
To address this limitation, we introduce MolBridge, a novel molecule-text
learning framework based on substructure-aware alignments. Specifically, we
augment the original molecule-description pairs with additional alignment
signals derived from molecular substructures and chemical phrases. To
effectively learn from these enriched alignments, MolBridge employs
substructure-aware contrastive learning, coupled with a self-refinement
mechanism that filters out noisy alignment signals. Experimental results show
that MolBridge effectively captures fine-grained correspondences and
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on a wide range of molecular benchmarks,
highlighting the significance of substructure-aware alignment in molecule-text
learning.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of advanced feature

### [96] [A Game-Theoretic Spatio-Temporal Reinforcement Learning Framework for Collaborative Public Resource Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26184)
*Songxin Lei,Qiongyan Wang,Yanchen Zhu,Hanyu Yao,Sijie Ruan,Weilin Ruan,Yuyu Luo,Huaming Wu,Yuxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Collaborative Public Resource Allocation (CPRA) with capacity constraints and proposes Game-Theoretic Spatio-Temporal Reinforcement Learning (GSTRL) framework to solve this NP-hard problem by formulating it as a potential game.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing public resource allocation methods optimize individual resources independently without considering capacity constraints, which limits their practical effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposed GSTRL framework that formulates CPRA as a potential game and uses spatio-temporal reinforcement learning to capture system dynamics while approximating Nash equilibrium.

Result: GSTRL demonstrated superior performance on two real-world datasets compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The CPRA problem with capacity constraints is effectively solved using the GSTRL framework, which provides both theoretical foundation and practical performance improvements for collaborative public resource allocation.

Abstract: Public resource allocation involves the efficient distribution of resources,
including urban infrastructure, energy, and transportation, to effectively meet
societal demands. However, existing methods focus on optimizing the movement of
individual resources independently, without considering their capacity
constraints. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and more practical
problem: Collaborative Public Resource Allocation (CPRA), which explicitly
incorporates capacity constraints and spatio-temporal dynamics in real-world
scenarios. We propose a new framework called Game-Theoretic Spatio-Temporal
Reinforcement Learning (GSTRL) for solving CPRA. Our contributions are twofold:
1) We formulate the CPRA problem as a potential game and demonstrate that there
is no gap between the potential function and the optimal target, laying a solid
theoretical foundation for approximating the Nash equilibrium of this NP-hard
problem; and 2) Our designed GSTRL framework effectively captures the
spatio-temporal dynamics of the overall system. We evaluate GSTRL on two
real-world datasets, where experiments show its superior performance. Our
source codes are available in the supplementary materials.

### [97] [Accumulative SGD Influence Estimation for Data Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26185)
*Yunxiao Shi,Shuo Yang,Yixin Su,Rui Zhang,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ACC-SGD-IE is a trajectory-aware influence estimator that improves upon standard SGD-IE by accounting for cross-epoch compounding effects, providing more accurate per-sample influence estimates for data-centric AI applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard SGD-IE approximates leave-one-out effects by summing per-epoch surrogates but ignores cross-epoch compounding, which leads to misranking of critical examples in modern data-centric AI applications.

Method: ACC-SGD-IE propagates leave-one-out perturbation across training and updates an accumulative influence state at each step, making it trajectory-aware rather than treating epochs independently.

Result: In smooth strongly convex settings, ACC-SGD-IE achieves geometric error contraction, and in smooth non-convex regimes it tightens error bounds. Empirically, it yields more accurate influence estimates across Adult, 20 Newsgroups, and MNIST datasets under various conditions.

Conclusion: ACC-SGD-IE more reliably flags noisy samples for data cleansing, producing models that outperform those cleaned with standard SGD-IE, especially over long training epochs.

Abstract: Modern data-centric AI needs precise per-sample influence. Standard SGD-IE
approximates leave-one-out effects by summing per-epoch surrogates and ignores
cross-epoch compounding, which misranks critical examples. We propose
ACC-SGD-IE, a trajectory-aware estimator that propagates the leave-one-out
perturbation across training and updates an accumulative influence state at
each step. In smooth strongly convex settings it achieves geometric error
contraction and, in smooth non-convex regimes, it tightens error bounds; larger
mini-batches further reduce constants. Empirically, on Adult, 20 Newsgroups,
and MNIST under clean and corrupted data and both convex and non-convex
training, ACC-SGD-IE yields more accurate influence estimates, especially over
long epochs. For downstream data cleansing it more reliably flags noisy
samples, producing models trained on ACC-SGD-IE cleaned data that outperform
those cleaned with SGD-IE.

TL;DR: Machine learning models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM) were used to predict hospital readmissions from health claims data, with PCA for dimensionality reduction. Random Forest performed best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing preventable hospital readmissions is a national priority to improve healthcare quality and lower costs, with readmission rates used as quality benchmarks.

Method: Used Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM on health claims data with Principal Component Analysis for dimension reduction, evaluated using AUC metric.

Result: Random Forest model achieved the highest performance, followed by Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine models in predicting all-cause readmissions.

Conclusion: These ML models can identify crucial factors causing readmissions and help target patients to reduce readmission rates, ultimately lowering costs and improving healthcare quality.

Abstract: Reducing preventable hospital readmissions is a national priority for payers,
providers, and policymakers seeking to improve health care and lower costs. The
rate of readmission is being used as a benchmark to determine the quality of
healthcare provided by the hospitals. In thisproject, we have used machine
learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector
Machines to analyze the health claims data and identify demographic and medical
factors that play a crucial role in predicting all-cause readmissions. As the
health claims data is high dimensional, we have used Principal Component
Analysis as a dimension reduction technique and used the results for building
regression models. We compared and evaluated these models based on the Area
Under Curve (AUC) metric. Random Forest model gave the highest performance
followed by Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine models. These models
can be used to identify the crucial factors causing readmissions and help
identify patients to focus on to reduce the chances of readmission, ultimately
bringing down the cost and increasing the quality of healthcare provided to the
patients.

*Sekitoshi Kanai,Tsukasa Yoshida,Hiroshi Takahashi,Haru Kuroki,Kazumune Hashimoto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AISP is a test-time alignment method for LLMs that uses Gaussian perturbation on pre-logits with adaptive importance sampling to maximize rewards, outperforming existing methods in efficiency and reward achievement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning LLMs is computationally expensive, so test-time alignment methods are needed to adapt models without full retraining.

Method: Apply Gaussian perturbation to pre-logits (penultimate layer outputs) and use adaptive importance sampling with sampled rewards to find optimal perturbation mean.

Result: AISP achieves higher rewards than best-of-n sampling and other reward-based test-time alignment methods while using fewer samples.

Conclusion: AISP provides an efficient test-time alignment approach that maximizes rewards through adaptive importance sampling on pre-logits.

Abstract: Test-time alignment of large language models (LLMs) attracts attention
because fine-tuning LLMs requires high computational costs. In this paper, we
propose a new test-time alignment method called adaptive importance sampling on
pre-logits (AISP) on the basis of the sampling-based model predictive control
with the stochastic control input. AISP applies the Gaussian perturbation into
pre-logits, which are outputs of the penultimate layer, so as to maximize
expected rewards with respect to the mean of the perturbation. We demonstrate
that the optimal mean is obtained by importance sampling with sampled rewards.
AISP outperforms best-of-n sampling in terms of rewards over the number of used
samples and achieves higher rewards than other reward-based test-time alignment
methods.

*Minyi Peng,Darian Gunamardi,Ivan Tjuawinata,Kwok-Yan Lam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an inductive machine unlearning approach that treats classification training as a sequential process, enabling unlearning by reversing the last training sequence using a projection-redistribution layer, without requiring full access to original datasets or models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine unlearning methods face scalability issues and practical deployment challenges, requiring full access to original datasets and models. The authors aim to develop a more practical, scalable solution that can be easily integrated into existing classification pipelines.

Method: Treat classification training as a sequential process where classes are learned sequentially. Implement unlearning by reversing the last training sequence using a projection-redistribution layer appended to the model end, enabling modular and model-agnostic deployment.

Result: Experiments on image datasets (CIFAR-10/100 with CNN models) and tabular datasets (Covertype with tree-based models) show consistently similar output to fully retrained models with significant computational cost reduction.

Conclusion: The proposed inductive approach demonstrates applicability, scalability, and system compatibility while maintaining performance in practical settings, offering a more deployable solution compared to existing machine unlearning methods.

Abstract: As a new and promising approach, existing machine unlearning (MU) works
typically emphasize theoretical formulations or optimization objectives to
achieve knowledge removal. However, when deployed in real-world scenarios, such
solutions typically face scalability issues and have to address practical
requirements such as full access to original datasets and model. In contrast to
the existing approaches, we regard classification training as a sequential
process where classes are learned sequentially, which we call \emph{inductive
approach}. Unlearning can then be done by reversing the last training sequence.
This is implemented by appending a projection-redistribution layer in the end
of the model. Such an approach does not require full access to the original
dataset or the model, addressing the challenges of existing methods. This
enables modular and model-agnostic deployment as an output filter into existing
classification pipelines with minimal alterations. We conducted multiple
experiments across multiple datasets including image (CIFAR-10/100 using
CNN-based model) and tabular datasets (Covertype using tree-based model).
Experiment results show consistently similar output to a fully retrained model
with a high computational cost reduction. This demonstrates the applicability,
scalability, and system compatibility of our solution while maintaining the
performance of the output in a more practical setting.

*Hieu M. Vu,Tan M. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Angular Steering is a novel method for controlling specific behaviors in LLMs by rotating activations within a fixed 2D subspace, providing continuous control over behaviors like refusal and compliance while maintaining general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current steering methods are constrained to 2D subspaces and are sensitive to parameters, potentially affecting unrelated features due to unintended activation space interactions.

Method: Formulates steering as geometric rotation toward/away from target behavior directions within a fixed 2D subspace, with Adaptive Angular Steering variant that rotates only aligned activations.

Result: Achieves robust behavioral control while maintaining general language modeling performance across multiple model families and sizes, with enhanced stability and coherence.

Conclusion: Angular Steering generalizes existing techniques under a unified geometric framework, simplifying parameter selection and demonstrating flexibility, generalization, and robustness compared to prior approaches.

Abstract: Controlling specific behaviors in large language models while preserving
their general capabilities is a central challenge for safe and reliable
artificial intelligence deployment. Current steering methods, such as vector
addition and directional ablation, are constrained within a two-dimensional
subspace defined by the activation and feature direction, making them sensitive
to chosen parameters and potentially affecting unrelated features due to
unintended interactions in activation space. We introduce Angular Steering, a
novel and flexible method for behavior modulation that operates by rotating
activations within a fixed two-dimensional subspace. By formulating steering as
a geometric rotation toward or away from a target behavior direction, Angular
Steering provides continuous, fine-grained control over behaviors such as
refusal and compliance. We demonstrate this method using refusal steering
emotion steering as use cases. Additionally, we propose Adaptive Angular
Steering, a selective variant that rotates only activations aligned with the
target feature, further enhancing stability and coherence. Angular Steering
generalizes existing addition and orthogonalization techniques under a unified
geometric rotation framework, simplifying parameter selection and maintaining
model stability across a broader range of adjustments. Experiments across
multiple model families and sizes show that Angular Steering achieves robust
behavioral control while maintaining general language modeling performance,
underscoring its flexibility, generalization, and robustness compared to prior
approaches. Code and artifacts are available at

*Frederik Möbius Rygaard,Shen Zhu,Yinzhu Jin,Søren Hauberg,Tom Fletcher*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel interpolation method for generative models that creates likely transition paths between data points without requiring additional training, functioning as geodesics under a Riemannian metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most generative models lack principled interpolation methods without restrictive assumptions, limiting controlled generation and model inspection capabilities.

Method: Developed a general interpolation scheme that computes geodesic-like curves constrained to data distributions, requiring no additional training and working with various metrics and probability distributions.

Result: The method traverses higher density regions than baseline approaches across multiple models and datasets, with theoretical justification showing it locally behaves as geodesics under suitable Riemannian metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed interpolation scheme provides a principled approach for generative model interpolation that maintains compatibility with data distributions and outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Interpolation in generative models allows for controlled generation, model
inspection, and more. Unfortunately, most generative models lack a principal
notion of interpolants without restrictive assumptions on either the model or
data dimension. In this paper, we develop a general interpolation scheme that
targets likely transition paths compatible with different metrics and
probability distributions. We consider interpolants analogous to a geodesic
constrained to a suitable data distribution and derive a novel algorithm for
computing these curves, which requires no additional training. Theoretically,
we show that our method locally can be considered as a geodesic under a
suitable Riemannian metric. We quantitatively show that our interpolation
scheme traverses higher density regions than baselines across a range of models
and datasets.

*Kim Yong Tan,Yueming Lyu,Ivor Tsang,Yew-Soon Ong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IMG algorithm optimizes diffusion process at inference-time using weighted resampling to generate samples satisfying multiple objectives, achieving higher hypervolume with single generation pass compared to methods requiring hundreds of generations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches treat diffusion models as black-box refiners with external optimization loops, overlooking internal distribution transitions and limiting efficiency in multi-objective optimization.

Method: Proposes Inference-time Multi-target Generation (IMG) algorithm that performs weighted resampling during diffusion generation according to expected aggregated multi-objective values, ensuring samples follow desired multi-target Boltzmann distribution.

Result: IMG achieves significantly higher hypervolume than baseline optimization algorithms in multi-objective molecule generation, requiring only single generation pass vs hundreds of diffusion generations for baselines.

Conclusion: IMG provides optimized diffusion process that can be integrated into existing methods, with multi-target Boltzmann distribution being optimal solution to distributional multi-objective optimization problem.

Abstract: Diffusion models have been successful in learning complex data distributions.
This capability has driven their application to high-dimensional
multi-objective black-box optimization problem. Existing approaches often
employ an external optimization loop, such as an evolutionary algorithm, to the
diffusion model. However, these approaches treat the diffusion model as a
black-box refiner, which overlooks the internal distribution transition of the
diffusion generation process, limiting their efficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose the Inference-time Multi-target Generation (IMG)
algorithm, which optimizes the diffusion process at inference-time to generate
samples that simultaneously satisfy multiple objectives. Specifically, our IMG
performs weighted resampling during the diffusion generation process according
to the expected aggregated multi-objective values. This weighted resampling
strategy ensures the diffusion-generated samples are distributed according to
our desired multi-target Boltzmann distribution. We further derive that the
multi-target Boltzmann distribution has an interesting log-likelihood
interpretation, where it is the optimal solution to the distributional
multi-objective optimization problem. We implemented IMG for a multi-objective
molecule generation task. Experiments show that IMG, requiring only a single
generation pass, achieves a significantly higher hypervolume than baseline
optimization algorithms that often require hundreds of diffusion generations.
Notably, our algorithm can be viewed as an optimized diffusion process and can
be integrated into existing methods to further improve their performance.

*Xia Jiang,Rong J. B. Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a hierarchical Bayesian framework for multi-task contextual bandits that captures task heterogeneity and correlations, with two algorithms (ebmTS and ebmUCB) that outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-task bandit methods overlook learning covariance structures across bandits, limiting their ability to effectively share information while accommodating instance-specific variations.

Method: Hierarchical Bayesian framework with empirical Bayesian approach to estimate prior covariance matrix, developing ebmTS (Thompson Sampling) and ebmUCB (Upper Confidence Bound) algorithms.

Result: Algorithms achieve lower cumulative regret than existing techniques on synthetic and real-world datasets, especially in complex environments, with theoretical regret bounds provided.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical Bayesian framework effectively balances exploration and exploitation across multi-bandits, demonstrating superior performance through both theoretical analysis and empirical validation.

Abstract: Multi-task learning in contextual bandits has attracted significant research
interest due to its potential to enhance decision-making across multiple
related tasks by leveraging shared structures and task-specific heterogeneity.
In this article, we propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework for
learning in various bandit instances. This framework captures both the
heterogeneity and the correlations among different bandit instances through a
hierarchical Bayesian model, enabling effective information sharing while
accommodating instance-specific variations. Unlike previous methods that
overlook the learning of the covariance structure across bandits, we introduce
an empirical Bayesian approach to estimate the covariance matrix of the prior
distribution.This enhances both the practicality and flexibility of learning
across multi-bandits. Building on this approach, we develop two efficient
algorithms: ebmTS (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Thompson Sampling) and
ebmUCB (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Upper Confidence Bound), both of which
incorporate the estimated prior into the decision-making process. We provide
the frequentist regret upper bounds for the proposed algorithms, thereby
filling a research gap in the field of multi-bandit problems. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior
performance of our algorithms, particularly in complex environments. Our
methods achieve lower cumulative regret compared to existing techniques,
highlighting their effectiveness in balancing exploration and exploitation
across multi-bandits.

*Jingyuan Liu,Fatemeh Ghaffari,Xuchuang Wang,Mohammad Hajiesmaili,Carlee Joe-Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses offline preference learning from pairwise feedback with multiple users having different preferences, proposing clustering-based methods to handle data imbalance and improve utility for test users through both pure offline and active-data augmentation approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world preference learning faces challenges with limited user interactions and diverse user preferences, requiring effective data aggregation and handling of imbalanced offline data across different preference dimensions.

Method: Proposes Off-C²PL for pure offline setting using clustering to group similar users, and A²-Off-C²PL for active-data augmentation that selects additional samples targeting least-informative dimensions of test user's preference based on learned cluster structure.

Result: Theoretical analysis provides suboptimality bounds capturing tradeoff between sample noise and bias, and shows actively collected samples contribute more effectively than offline ones. Simulations on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the theoretical results.

Conclusion: The proposed clustering-based framework effectively addresses challenges in offline preference learning with multiple users, demonstrating improved utility through both pure offline and active-data augmentation approaches.

Abstract: Preference learning from pairwise feedback is a widely adopted framework in
applications such as reinforcement learning with human feedback and
recommendations. In many practical settings, however, user interactions are
limited or costly, making offline preference learning necessary. Moreover,
real-world preference learning often involves users with different preferences.
For example, annotators from different backgrounds may rank the same responses
differently. This setting presents two central challenges: (1) identifying
similarity across users to effectively aggregate data, especially under
scenarios where offline data is imbalanced across dimensions, and (2) handling
the imbalanced offline data where some preference dimensions are
underrepresented. To address these challenges, we study the Offline Clustering
of Preference Learning problem, where the learner has access to fixed datasets
from multiple users with potentially different preferences and aims to maximize
utility for a test user. To tackle the first challenge, we first propose
Off-C$^2$PL for the pure offline setting, where the learner relies solely on
offline data. Our theoretical analysis provides a suboptimality bound that
explicitly captures the tradeoff between sample noise and bias. To address the
second challenge of inbalanced data, we extend our framework to the setting
with active-data augmentation where the learner is allowed to select a limited
number of additional active-data for the test user based on the cluster
structure learned by Off-C$^2$PL. In this setting, our second algorithm,
A$^2$-Off-C$^2$PL, actively selects samples that target the least-informative
dimensions of the test user's preference. We prove that these actively
collected samples contribute more effectively than offline ones. Finally, we
validate our theoretical results through simulations on synthetic and
real-world datasets.

*Ziliang Chen,Tianang Xiao,Jusheng Zhang,Yongsen Zheng,Xipeng Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a token-aware causal representation learning framework that explains CLIP's compositional reasoning failures through composition nonidentifiability, showing pseudo-optimal encoders can achieve perfect alignment but fail on hard negatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP shows strong cross-modal generalization but persistently fails at compositional reasoning over objects, attributes, and relations, behaving like a bag-of-words matcher. Prior causal accounts obscure token-level structure, leaving core phenomena unexplained.

Method: Proposes a token-aware causal representation learning framework with sequential language-token SCM, extending block identifiability to tokenized text. Proves CLIP's contrastive objective can recover modal-invariant latent variables under both sentence-level and token-level SCMs.

Result: Identifies composition nonidentifiability as the principled explanation for CLIP's compositional brittleness. Shows existence of pseudo-optimal text encoders that achieve perfect modal-invariant alignment but are insensitive to SWAP, REPLACE, and ADD operations over atomic concepts.

Conclusion: Token granularity explains CLIP's compositional failures, linking language-side nonidentifiability to visual-side failures via modality gap. Suggests improved negative mining strategies to address iterated composition operator compounding hardness.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) delivers strong cross modal
generalization by aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space, yet it
persistently fails at compositional reasoning over objects, attributes, and
relations often behaving like a bag-of-words matcher. Prior causal accounts
typically model text as a single vector, obscuring token-level structure and
leaving core phenomena-such as prompt sensitivity and failures on hard
negatives unexplained. We address this gap with a token-aware causal
representation learning (CRL) framework grounded in a sequential,
language-token SCM. Our theory extends block identifiability to tokenized text,
proving that CLIP's contrastive objective can recover the modal-invariant
latent variable under both sentence-level and token-level SCMs. Crucially,
token granularity yields the first principled explanation of CLIP's
compositional brittleness: composition nonidentifiability. We show the
existence of pseudo-optimal text encoders that achieve perfect modal-invariant
alignment yet are provably insensitive to SWAP, REPLACE, and ADD operations
over atomic concepts, thereby failing to distinguish correct captions from hard
negatives despite optimizing the same training objective as true-optimal
encoders. The analysis further links language-side nonidentifiability to
visual-side failures via the modality gap and shows how iterated composition
operators compound hardness, motivating improved negative mining strategies.

### [107] [Implicit Bias of Per-sample Adam on Separable Data: Departure from the Full-batch Regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26303)
*Beomhan Baek,Minhak Song,Chulhee Yun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the implicit bias of incremental Adam optimizer, showing it differs from full-batch Adam by converging to ℓ₂-max-margin solutions on structured datasets, while Signum maintains ℓ∞-max-margin bias across all batch sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adam is widely used but poorly understood theoretically, especially regarding how its implicit bias differs between full-batch and incremental (one sample per step) regimes. Prior work only analyzed full-batch Adam's ℓ∞-max-margin bias.

Method: The authors study incremental Adam for logistic regression on separable data, construct structured datasets to demonstrate different convergence behavior, develop a proxy algorithm to capture incremental Adam's limiting behavior as β₂→1, and analyze Signum's convergence properties.

Result: Incremental Adam converges to ℓ₂-max-margin classifier on structured datasets, contrasting with full-batch Adam's ℓ∞-max-margin bias. A dual fixed-point formulation characterizes convergence direction. Signum maintains ℓ∞-max-margin bias regardless of batch size when β is close to 1.

Conclusion: Adam's implicit bias depends crucially on both batching scheme and dataset structure, while Signum's bias remains invariant. This reveals important differences between optimization algorithms' behavior in different training regimes.

Abstract: Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2015] is the de facto optimizer in deep learning, yet
its theoretical understanding remains limited. Prior analyses show that Adam
favors solutions aligned with $\ell_\infty$-geometry, but these results are
restricted to the full-batch regime. In this work, we study the implicit bias
of incremental Adam (using one sample per step) for logistic regression on
linearly separable data, and we show that its bias can deviate from the
full-batch behavior. To illustrate this, we construct a class of structured
datasets where incremental Adam provably converges to the $\ell_2$-max-margin
classifier, in contrast to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin bias of full-batch
Adam. For general datasets, we develop a proxy algorithm that captures the
limiting behavior of incremental Adam as $\beta_2 \to 1$ and we characterize
its convergence direction via a data-dependent dual fixed-point formulation.
Finally, we prove that, unlike Adam, Signum [Bernstein et al., 2018] converges
to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin classifier for any batch size by taking $\beta$
close enough to 1. Overall, our results highlight that the implicit bias of
Adam crucially depends on both the batching scheme and the dataset, while
Signum remains invariant.

*Ruilin Tong,Haodong Lu,Yuhang Liu,Dong Gong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Per-layer Model Inversion (PMI) and feature modeling for data-free continual learning, addressing challenges in model inversion for large pre-trained models like CLIP by improving efficiency and mitigating feature drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data-free continual learning is needed when storing and replaying previous data is infeasible due to privacy/security constraints or impractical for pre-trained models. Existing model inversion methods face computational inefficiency and feature drift issues.

Method: Proposes PMI (Per-layer Model Inversion) for efficient initialization, models class-wise features via Gaussian distributions and contrastive learning to align synthetic and real features, and generates pseudo-images from semantic-aware projected features.

Result: The approach achieves strong effectiveness and compatibility across multiple continual learning settings, substantially reducing inversion iterations while maintaining performance on prior tasks.

Conclusion: The combination of PMI and feature modeling enables efficient data-free continual learning for large pre-trained models, addressing both computational efficiency and feature alignment challenges.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to incrementally train a model on a sequence of
tasks while retaining performance on prior ones. However, storing and replaying
data is often infeasible due to privacy or security constraints and impractical
for arbitrary pre-trained models. Data-free CL seeks to update models without
access to previous data. Beyond regularization, we employ model inversion to
synthesize data from the trained model, enabling replay without storing
samples. Yet, model inversion in predictive models faces two challenges: (1)
generating inputs solely from compressed output labels causes drift between
synthetic and real data, and replaying such data can erode prior knowledge; (2)
inversion is computationally expensive since each step backpropagates through
the full model. These issues are amplified in large pre-trained models such as
CLIP. To improve efficiency, we propose Per-layer Model Inversion (PMI),
inspired by faster convergence in single-layer optimization. PMI provides
strong initialization for full-model inversion, substantially reducing
iterations. To mitigate feature shift, we model class-wise features via
Gaussian distributions and contrastive model, ensuring alignment between
synthetic and real features. Combining PMI and feature modeling, our approach
enables continual learning of new classes by generating pseudo-images from
semantic-aware projected features, achieving strong effectiveness and
compatibility across multiple CL settings.

*Sascha Mücke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Quantum annealing can train SVMs via QUBO formulation, with competitive performance even at low bit precision (e.g., 1 bit per parameter). Bit-depth increases don't always improve classification, suggesting support vector selection matters more than precise weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how quantum annealing can be used for SVM training through QUBO formulation and investigate the impact of qubit count (discretization level) on predictive performance compared to classical methods.

Method: Formulate SVM training as QUBO problem, use quantum annealing for optimization, vary discretization levels of dual weights (bit precision), and compare with classical LIBSVM solver across different datasets.

Result: Low-precision QUBO encodings (1 bit per parameter) yield competitive and sometimes superior accuracy compared to LIBSVM. Increased bit-depth enables larger regularization parameters but doesn't always improve classification performance.

Conclusion: Support vector selection may be more important than precise weighting. Quantum annealing shows potential for efficient SVM training as quantum devices scale, despite current hardware limitations on QUBO size.

Abstract: Training Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can be formulated as a QUBO problem,
enabling the use of quantum annealing for model optimization. In this work, we
study how the number of qubits - linked to the discretization level of dual
weights - affects predictive performance across datasets. We compare QUBO-based
SVM training to the classical LIBSVM solver and find that even low-precision
QUBO encodings (e.g., 1 bit per parameter) yield competitive, and sometimes
superior, accuracy. While increased bit-depth enables larger regularization
parameters, it does not always improve classification. Our findings suggest
that selecting the right support vectors may matter more than their precise
weighting. Although current hardware limits the size of solvable QUBOs, our
results highlight the potential of quantum annealing for efficient SVM training
as quantum devices scale.

### [110] [Posterior Sampling by Combining Diffusion Models with Annealed Langevin Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26324)
*Zhiyang Xun,Shivam Gupta,Eric Price*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for posterior sampling in noisy linear inverse problems by combining diffusion models with annealed Langevin dynamics, achieving polynomial-time sampling with only L^4 bounds on score estimation error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Posterior sampling is crucial for tasks like inpainting, deblurring, and MRI reconstruction, but approximate posterior sampling is computationally intractable in general. Existing methods like Langevin dynamics are brittle to score estimation errors, requiring strong assumptions.

Method: The authors combine diffusion models with an annealed variant of Langevin dynamics for conditional sampling in log-concave distributions. This approach leverages the robustness of diffusion models to score estimation errors.

Result: The proposed method achieves conditional sampling in polynomial time using only an L^4 bound on the score estimation error, which is weaker than the sub-exponential (MGF) bound required by standard Langevin dynamics.

Conclusion: The combination of diffusion models with annealed Langevin dynamics provides an efficient and robust framework for posterior sampling in noisy linear inverse problems, overcoming the brittleness of previous methods to score estimation errors.

Abstract: Given a noisy linear measurement $y = Ax + \xi$ of a distribution $p(x)$, and
a good approximation to the prior $p(x)$, when can we sample from the posterior
$p(x \mid y)$? Posterior sampling provides an accurate and fair framework for
tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and MRI reconstruction, and several
heuristics attempt to approximate it. Unfortunately, approximate posterior
sampling is computationally intractable in general.
  To sidestep this hardness, we focus on (local or global) log-concave
distributions $p(x)$. In this regime, Langevin dynamics yields posterior
samples when the exact scores of $p(x)$ are available, but it is brittle to
score--estimation error, requiring an MGF bound (sub-exponential error). By
contrast, in the unconditional setting, diffusion models succeed with only an
$L^2$ bound on the score error. We prove that combining diffusion models with
an annealed variant of Langevin dynamics achieves conditional sampling in
polynomial time using merely an $L^4$ bound on the score error.

### [111] [Agent Skills Enable a New Class of Realistic and Trivially Simple Prompt Injections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26328)
*David Schmotz,Sahar Abdelnabi,Maksym Andriushchenko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that Agent Skills in LLMs are fundamentally insecure and vulnerable to simple prompt injections that can exfiltrate sensitive data and bypass system guardrails.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate security vulnerabilities in the Agent Skills framework introduced by a frontier LLM company, which aims to enable continual learning but may have critical security flaws.

Method: The researchers demonstrate how to hide malicious instructions in long Agent Skill files and referenced scripts, and show how to bypass system-level guardrails by exploiting the "Don't ask again" approval option.

Result: The study successfully shows that Agent Skills enable trivial prompt injections that can exfiltrate sensitive data like internal files and passwords, and that system guardrails can be bypassed through approval carry-over mechanisms.

Conclusion: Despite ongoing research and scaling model capabilities, frontier LLMs remain vulnerable to simple prompt injections in realistic scenarios, highlighting fundamental security weaknesses in the Agent Skills framework.

Abstract: Enabling continual learning in LLMs remains a key unresolved research
challenge. In a recent announcement, a frontier LLM company made a step towards
this by introducing Agent Skills, a framework that equips agents with new
knowledge based on instructions stored in simple markdown files. Although Agent
Skills can be a very useful tool, we show that they are fundamentally insecure,
since they enable trivially simple prompt injections. We demonstrate how to
hide malicious instructions in long Agent Skill files and referenced scripts to
exfiltrate sensitive data, such as internal files or passwords. Importantly, we
show how to bypass system-level guardrails of a popular coding agent: a benign,
task-specific approval with the "Don't ask again" option can carry over to
closely related but harmful actions. Overall, we conclude that despite ongoing
research efforts and scaling model capabilities, frontier LLMs remain
vulnerable to very simple prompt injections in realistic scenarios. Our code is

### [112] [Linear Causal Discovery with Interventional Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26342)
*Zhigao Guo,Feng Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces interventional constraints as a novel concept in causal discovery that encodes high-level causal knowledge through inequality constraints on causal effects, addressing limitations of existing methods that may produce incorrect causal conclusions despite structural constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing causal discovery methods can enforce structural constraints but may still produce incorrect causal conclusions (e.g., learning 'PIP3 inhibits Akt' when it's known to activate Akt). There's a need to incorporate causal knowledge and mechanisms to refine causal models and improve downstream tasks like treatment design.

Method: Proposed a metric to quantify total causal effects for linear causal models and formulated the problem as a constrained optimization task, solved using a two-stage constrained optimization method.

Result: Evaluation on real-world datasets showed that integrating interventional constraints improves model accuracy, ensures consistency with established findings, makes models more explainable, and facilitates discovery of new causal relationships that would be costly to identify otherwise.

Conclusion: Interventional constraints bridge the gap between structural constraints and actual causal effects, providing a powerful framework for incorporating causal knowledge into causal discovery while enabling the discovery of new relationships.

Abstract: Incorporating causal knowledge and mechanisms is essential for refining
causal models and improving downstream tasks such as designing new treatments.
In this paper, we introduce a novel concept in causal discovery, termed
interventional constraints, which differs fundamentally from interventional
data. While interventional data require direct perturbations of variables,
interventional constraints encode high-level causal knowledge in the form of
inequality constraints on causal effects. For instance, in the Sachs dataset
(Sachs et al.\ 2005), Akt has been shown to be activated by PIP3, meaning PIP3
exerts a positive causal effect on Akt. Existing causal discovery methods allow
enforcing structural constraints (for example, requiring a causal path from
PIP3 to Akt), but they may still produce incorrect causal conclusions such as
learning that "PIP3 inhibits Akt". Interventional constraints bridge this gap
by explicitly constraining the total causal effect between variable pairs,
ensuring learned models respect known causal influences. To formalize
interventional constraints, we propose a metric to quantify total causal
effects for linear causal models and formulate the problem as a constrained
optimization task, solved using a two-stage constrained optimization method. We
evaluate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate that integrating
interventional constraints not only improves model accuracy and ensures
consistency with established findings, making models more explainable, but also
facilitates the discovery of new causal relationships that would otherwise be
costly to identify.

*Sebastian Zieglmeier,Niklas Erdmann,Narada D. Warakagoda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper modifies classical RL approaches to handle sparse, randomized, and nonstationary environments, showing that a modified Monte Carlo-based method outperforms traditional Q-learning and exhaustive search patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL algorithms struggle in random, nonstationary, and reward-sparse environments like underwater pollution cloud searching with AUVs, where actions often yield zero rewards.

Method: Systematic study of modifications including hierarchical algorithm changes, multigoal learning, and integration of location memory as external output filter to prevent state revisits.

Result: Modified Monte Carlo-based approach significantly outperforms traditional Q-learning and two exhaustive search patterns.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning approaches can be effectively adapted for use in random, nonstationary, and reward-sparse environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed to optimize
problem-solving by learning actions that maximize rewards, a task that becomes
particularly challenging in random and nonstationary environments. Even
advanced RL algorithms are often limited in their ability to solve problems in
these conditions. In applications such as searching for underwater pollution
clouds with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), RL algorithms must navigate
reward-sparse environments, where actions frequently result in a zero reward.
This paper aims to address these challenges by revisiting and modifying
classical RL approaches to efficiently operate in sparse, randomized, and
nonstationary environments. We systematically study a large number of
modifications, including hierarchical algorithm changes, multigoal learning,
and the integration of a location memory as an external output filter to
prevent state revisits. Our results demonstrate that a modified Monte
Carlo-based approach significantly outperforms traditional Q-learning and two
exhaustive search patterns, illustrating its potential in adapting RL to
complex environments. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning
approaches can be effectively adapted for use in random, nonstationary, and
reward-sparse environments.

*Furkan Pala,Islem Rekik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UnifiedFL is a dynamic federated learning framework that addresses architectural and statistical heterogeneity by representing heterogeneous local networks as nodes and edges in a directed model graph optimized by a shared graph neural network (GNN).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL frameworks have limitations in supporting fundamentally different neural architectures across clients and fail to address domain-fracture problems where client data distributions differ from test distributions, undermining model generalizability.

Method: Proposes UnifiedFL with three key components: (i) a common GNN to parameterize all architectures, (ii) distance-driven clustering via Euclidean distances between clients' parameters, and (iii) a two-tier aggregation policy balancing convergence and diversity.

Result: Experiments on MedMNIST classification and hippocampus segmentation benchmarks demonstrate UnifiedFL's superior performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: UnifiedFL effectively handles federated learning scenarios with heterogeneous architectures, non-identically distributed data, and distinct test domains, overcoming limitations of current FL approaches.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a key paradigm for collaborative model
training across multiple clients without sharing raw data, enabling
privacy-preserving applications in areas such as radiology and pathology.
However, works on collaborative training across clients with fundamentally
different neural architectures and non-identically distributed datasets remain
scarce. Existing FL frameworks face several limitations. Despite claiming to
support architectural heterogeneity, most recent FL methods only tolerate
variants within a single model family (e.g., shallower, deeper, or wider CNNs),
still presuming a shared global architecture and failing to accommodate
federations where clients deploy fundamentally different network types (e.g.,
CNNs, GNNs, MLPs). Moreover, existing approaches often address only statistical
heterogeneity while overlooking the domain-fracture problem, where each
client's data distribution differs markedly from that faced at testing time,
undermining model generalizability. When clients use different architectures,
have non-identically distributed data, and encounter distinct test domains,
current methods perform poorly. To address these challenges, we propose
UnifiedFL, a dynamic federated learning framework that represents heterogeneous
local networks as nodes and edges in a directed model graph optimized by a
shared graph neural network (GNN). UnifiedFL introduces (i) a common GNN to
parameterize all architectures, (ii) distance-driven clustering via Euclidean
distances between clients' parameters, and (iii) a two-tier aggregation policy
balancing convergence and diversity. Experiments on MedMNIST classification and
hippocampus segmentation benchmarks demonstrate UnifiedFL's superior
performance. Code and data: https://github.com/basiralab/UnifiedFL

advances transparent and auditable financial AI systems.

TL;DR: CorVS is a novel person identification method that matches visual tracking trajectories with wearable sensor measurements using deep learning to predict correspondence probabilities and reliabilities, then performs temporal matching for real-world warehouse applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Worker location data is crucial for productivity in industrial sites. While cameras offer valuable environmental context, identifying individuals with only visual data is impractical. Existing methods that combine trajectories and sensor measurements may fail under real-world conditions.

Method: 1) A deep learning model predicts correspondence probabilities and reliabilities for every trajectory-sensor pair. 2) An algorithm matches trajectories and sensor measurements over time using the predicted probabilities and reliabilities.

Result: The method was developed and tested using a dataset with actual warehouse operations, demonstrating effectiveness for real-world applications.

Conclusion: CorVS provides an effective solution for person identification in industrial environments by combining visual tracking and sensor data through data-driven correspondence prediction and temporal matching.

Abstract: Worker location data is key to higher productivity in industrial sites.
Cameras are a promising tool for localization in logistics warehouses since
they also offer valuable environmental contexts such as package status.
However, identifying individuals with only visual data is often impractical.
Accordingly, several prior studies identified people in videos by comparing
their trajectories and wearable sensor measurements. While this approach has
advantages such as independence from appearance, the existing methods may break
down under real-world conditions. To overcome this challenge, we propose CorVS,
a novel data-driven person identification method based on correspondence
between visual tracking trajectories and sensor measurements. Firstly, our deep
learning model predicts correspondence probabilities and reliabilities for
every pair of a trajectory and sensor measurements. Secondly, our algorithm
matches the trajectories and sensor measurements over time using the predicted
probabilities and reliabilities. We developed a dataset with actual warehouse
operations and demonstrated the method's effectiveness for real-world
applications.

*Ningning Tao,Fei Xie,Baoxiang Pan,Hongyu Wang,Han Huang,Zhongpu Qiu,Ke Gui,Jiali Luo,Xiaosong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FM-Cast is a generative AI model using Flow Matching for probabilistic forecasting of Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs), achieving comparable accuracy to leading NWP systems with much faster computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSWs are crucial for subseasonal predictability but remain challenging to forecast accurately due to physical representation limitations, initialization issues, and high computational costs of ensemble forecasts in traditional NWP systems.

Method: Developed a Flow Matching-based generative AI model (FM-Cast) for probabilistic forecasting of stratospheric circulation evolution, enabling efficient ensemble generation.

Result: FM-Cast successfully forecasted 10 out of 18 major SSW events (1998-2024) up to 20 days in advance with ensemble accuracies above 50%, requiring only 2 minutes for 50-member, 30-day forecasts on consumer GPUs.

Conclusion: The work establishes a computationally efficient paradigm for probabilistic stratospheric forecasting and demonstrates generative AI's potential to enhance physical understanding of atmosphere-climate dynamics, particularly distinguishing between troposphere-forced and stratosphere-driven SSW events.

Abstract: Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs) are key sources of subseasonal
predictability and major drivers of extreme winter weather. Yet, their accurate
and efficient forecast remains a persistent challenge for numerical weather
prediction (NWP) systems due to limitations in physical representation,
initialization, and the immense computational demands of ensemble forecasts.
While data-driven forecasting is rapidly evolving, its application to the
complex, three-dimensional dynamics of SSWs, particularly for probabilistic
forecast, remains underexplored. Here, we bridge this gap by developing a Flow
Matching-based generative AI model (FM-Cast) for efficient and skillful
probabilistic forecasting of the spatiotemporal evolution of stratospheric
circulation. Evaluated across 18 major SSW events (1998-2024), FM-Cast
skillfully forecasts the onset, intensity, and morphology of 10 events up to 20
days in advance, achieving ensemble accuracies above 50%. Its performance is
comparable to or exceeds leading NWP systems while requiring only two minutes
for a 50-member, 30-day forecast on a consumer GPU. Furthermore, leveraging
FM-Cast as a scientific tool, we demonstrate through idealized experiments that
SSW predictability is fundamentally linked to its underlying physical drivers,
distinguishing between events forced from the troposphere and those driven by
internal stratospheric dynamics. Our work thus establishes a computationally
efficient paradigm for probabilistic forecasting stratospheric anomalies and
showcases generative AI's potential to deepen the physical understanding of
atmosphere-climate dynamics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoLA-World enables joint training of latent action models and pre-trained world models through a warm-up phase, overcoming representational collapse and outperforming previous two-stage approaches in video simulation and visual planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current two-stage approaches for adapting video generation models into controllable world models via latent actions suffer from redundant training and limited co-adaptation potential between the latent action model and world model.

Method: CoLA-World introduces a critical warm-up phase that aligns representations between the from-scratch latent action model and pre-trained world model, enabling joint training and creating a co-evolution cycle where both components mutually improve each other.

Result: Empirically, CoLA-World matches or outperforms prior two-stage methods in both video simulation quality and downstream visual planning tasks.

Conclusion: CoLA-World establishes a robust and efficient new paradigm for creating controllable world models by successfully enabling joint training of latent action models and pre-trained world models through representation alignment.

Abstract: Adapting pre-trained video generation models into controllable world models
via latent actions is a promising step towards creating generalist world
models. The dominant paradigm adopts a two-stage approach that trains latent
action model (LAM) and the world model separately, resulting in redundant
training and limiting their potential for co-adaptation. A conceptually simple
and appealing idea is to directly replace the forward dynamic model in LAM with
a powerful world model and training them jointly, but it is non-trivial and
prone to representational collapse. In this work, we propose CoLA-World, which
for the first time successfully realizes this synergistic paradigm, resolving
the core challenge in joint learning through a critical warm-up phase that
effectively aligns the representations of the from-scratch LAM with the
pre-trained world model. This unlocks a co-evolution cycle: the world model
acts as a knowledgeable tutor, providing gradients to shape a high-quality LAM,
while the LAM offers a more precise and adaptable control interface to the
world model. Empirically, CoLA-World matches or outperforms prior two-stage
methods in both video simulation quality and downstream visual planning,
establishing a robust and efficient new paradigm for the field.

Result: Significant improvements in prediction accuracy (6.67% to 74.55%) over state-of-the-art methods on COPD treatment outcome prediction, with strong robustness to varying high-fidelity dataset sizes.

Conclusion: CFKD-AFN effectively leverages low-fidelity data to enhance predictions on scarce high-fidelity data, with an interpretable variant supporting clinical decision-making through latent medical semantics exploration.

Abstract: Personalized treatment outcome prediction based on trial data for
small-sample and rare patient groups is critical in precision medicine.
However, the costly trial data limit the prediction performance. To address
this issue, we propose a cross-fidelity knowledge distillation and adaptive
fusion network (CFKD-AFN), which leverages abundant but low-fidelity simulation
data to enhance predictions on scarce but high-fidelity trial data. CFKD-AFN
incorporates a dual-channel knowledge distillation module to extract
complementary knowledge from the low-fidelity model, along with an
attention-guided fusion module to dynamically integrate multi-source
information. Experiments on treatment outcome prediction for the chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease demonstrates significant improvements of CFKD-AFN
over state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy, ranging from 6.67\% to
74.55\%, and strong robustness to varying high-fidelity dataset sizes.
Furthermore, we extend CFKD-AFN to an interpretable variant, enabling the
exploration of latent medical semantics to support clinical decision-making.

TL;DR: The paper proposes MRGC, a robust graph condensation framework that addresses vulnerability to adversarial attacks by constraining the condensed graph to lie within a smooth, low-dimensional manifold with minimal class ambiguity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph condensation methods overlook robustness when original graphs are corrupted, leading to significant performance deterioration, while current robust graph learning technologies offer limited effectiveness.

Method: MRGC adopts a geometry perspective of graph data manifold with three manifold learning modules that guide the condensed graph to lie within a smooth, low-dimensional manifold with minimal class ambiguity.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness of MRGC across diverse attack scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed MRGC framework effectively preserves the classification complexity reduction capability of graph condensation while ensuring robust performance under universal adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Graph condensation (GC) has gained significant attention for its ability to
synthesize smaller yet informative graphs. However, existing studies often
overlook the robustness of GC in scenarios where the original graph is
corrupted. In such cases, we observe that the performance of GC deteriorates
significantly, while existing robust graph learning technologies offer only
limited effectiveness. Through both empirical investigation and theoretical
analysis, we reveal that GC is inherently an intrinsic-dimension-reducing
process, synthesizing a condensed graph with lower classification complexity.
Although this property is critical for effective GC performance, it remains
highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. To tackle this vulnerability
and improve GC robustness, we adopt the geometry perspective of graph data
manifold and propose a novel Manifold-constrained Robust Graph Condensation
framework named MRGC. Specifically, we introduce three graph data manifold
learning modules that guide the condensed graph to lie within a smooth,
low-dimensional manifold with minimal class ambiguity, thereby preserving the
classification complexity reduction capability of GC and ensuring robust
performance under universal adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the robustness of \ModelName\ across diverse attack scenarios.

TL;DR: ReSpec is a system that adapts speculative decoding to reinforcement learning for LLMs, achieving up to 4.5x speedup while maintaining training stability and reward convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL training for LLMs is bottlenecked by generation time (over 75% of training time), and while speculative decoding accelerates serving systems, its integration into RL systems faces three key challenges: diminishing speedups at large batch sizes, drafter staleness from actor updates, and policy degradation from drafters.

Method: ReSpec addresses these gaps through three mechanisms: dynamic tuning of SD configurations, evolving the drafter via knowledge distillation, and weighting updates by rollout rewards.

Result: On Qwen models (3B-14B), ReSpec achieves up to 4.5x speedup while preserving reward convergence and training stability.

Conclusion: ReSpec provides a practical solution for efficient RL-based LLM adaptation by successfully adapting speculative decoding to reinforcement learning systems.

Abstract: Adapting large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL) is
often bottlenecked by the generation stage, which can consume over 75\% of the
training time. Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates autoregressive generation
in serving systems, but its behavior under RL training remains largely
unexplored. We identify three critical gaps that hinder the naive integration
of SD into RL systems: diminishing speedups at large batch sizes, drafter
staleness under continual actor updates, and drafter-induced policy
degradation.
  To address these gaps, we present ReSpec, a system that adapts SD to RL
through three complementary mechanisms: dynamically tuning SD configurations,
evolving the drafter via knowledge distillation, and weighting updates by
rollout rewards. On Qwen models (3B--14B), ReSpec achieves up to 4.5x speedup
while preserving reward convergence and training stability, providing a
practical solution for efficient RL-based LLM adaptation.

*Shahriar Noroozizadeh,Vaishnavh Nagarajan,Elan Rosenfeld,Sanjiv Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper contrasts associative vs geometric views of memory in sequence modeling, showing Transformers develop geometric representations of atomic facts that encode global relationships, simplifying complex reasoning tasks into geometric operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the prevailing associative view of memory as brute-force co-occurrence lookup and demonstrate that Transformers naturally develop geometric representations that encode global relationships between entities, including non-co-occurring ones.

Method: Isolated a clean Transformer reasoning instance incompatible with associative memory, analyzed neural embedding geometries, connected findings to Node2Vec, and identified spectral bias as the source of geometric representations.

Result: Found that Transformers synthesize geometric representations of atomic facts that simplify complex reasoning tasks, with this geometry arising from spectral bias rather than typical architectural pressures, even when not more efficient than associative lookup.

Conclusion: The geometric view of parametric memory should replace default associative intuitions, offering potential for improving Transformer memory and guiding research in knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.

Abstract: In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been
predominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between
entities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how
memory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of
Transformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of
the local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must
have somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global
relationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in
turn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\ell$-fold composition
into an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.
  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding
geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,
despite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly
attributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.
Counterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more
succinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.
  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry
stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed
arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also
points to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more
strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages
revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like
knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.

Conclusion: The proposed QGRU-WGAN with SuDaI and multi-metric gating demonstrates superior anomaly detection capability, practical feasibility on current quantum hardware, and robustness for network security applications.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in time-series data is a critical challenge with
significant implications for network security. Recent quantum machine learning
approaches, such as quantum kernel methods and variational quantum circuits,
have shown promise in capturing complex data distributions for anomaly
detection but remain constrained by limited qubit counts. We introduce in this
work a novel Quantum Gated Recurrent Unit (QGRU)-based Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) employing Successive Data Injection (SuDaI) and a multi-metric
gating strategy for robust network anomaly detection. Our model uniquely
utilizes a quantum-enhanced generator that outputs parameters (mean and
log-variance) of a Gaussian distribution via reparameterization, combined with
a Wasserstein critic to stabilize adversarial training. Anomalies are
identified through a novel gating mechanism that initially flags potential
anomalies based on Gaussian uncertainty estimates and subsequently verifies
them using a composite of critic scores and reconstruction errors. Evaluated on
benchmark datasets, our method achieves a high time-series aware F1 score
(TaF1) of 89.43% demonstrating superior capability in detecting anomalies
accurately and promptly as compared to existing classical and quantum models.
Furthermore, the trained QGRU-WGAN was deployed on real IBM Quantum hardware,
where it retained high anomaly detection performance, confirming its robustness
and practical feasibility on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)
devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To measure how AI research gains translate into economic value and automation by creating a benchmark that reflects real-world, economically valuable projects rather than just research-oriented tests.

Method: Introduced the Remote Labor Index (RLI) - a multi-sector benchmark comprising real-world projects designed to evaluate end-to-end AI agent performance in practical settings.

Abstract: AIs have made rapid progress on research-oriented benchmarks of knowledge and

TL;DR: CROPI is a multi-stage RL framework that uses influence functions for data selection in RLVR, achieving 2.66x acceleration with only 10% data per stage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data selection methods for RLVR are heuristic-based and lack theoretical guarantees, limiting their effectiveness and generalizability.

Method: Proposes off-policy influence estimation using pre-collected trajectories and sparse random projection for gradient dimensionality reduction, implemented in the CROPI framework.

Result: Achieves 2.66x step-level acceleration on 1.5B model using only 10% of data per stage compared to full-dataset training.

Conclusion: Influence-based data selection shows substantial potential for efficient RLVR training.

Abstract: Data selection is a critical aspect of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). Current data selection methods are largely heuristic-based,
lacking theoretical guarantees and generalizability. This work proposes a
theoretically-grounded approach using influence functions to estimate the
contribution of each data point to the learning objective. To overcome the
prohibitive computational cost of policy rollouts required for online influence
estimation, we introduce an off-policy influence estimation method that
efficiently approximates data influence using pre-collected offline
trajectories. Furthermore, to manage the high-dimensional gradients of LLMs, we
employ sparse random projection to reduce dimensionality and improve storage
and computation efficiency. Leveraging these techniques, we develop
\textbf{C}urriculum \textbf{R}L with \textbf{O}ff-\textbf{P}olicy
\text{I}nfluence guidance (\textbf{CROPI}), a multi-stage RL framework that
iteratively selects the most influential data for the current policy.
Experiments on models up to 7B parameters demonstrate that CROPI significantly
accelerates training. On a 1.5B model, it achieves a 2.66x step-level
acceleration while using only 10\% of the data per stage compared to
full-dataset training. Our results highlight the substantial potential of
influence-based data selection for efficient RLVR.

TL;DR: FP16 precision eliminates instability in RL fine-tuning of LLMs caused by BF16's rounding errors, providing more stable optimization and better performance without algorithm changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL fine-tuning of LLMs suffers from instability due to numerical mismatch between training and inference policies, with root cause identified as BF16 floating point precision introducing large rounding errors.

Method: Simply revert from BF16 to FP16 precision, which requires minimal code changes and no modifications to model architecture or learning algorithms.

Result: FP16 yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger performance across diverse tasks, algorithms and frameworks compared to BF16.

Conclusion: FP16 should be preferred over BF16 for RL fine-tuning of LLMs due to better numerical consistency between training and inference, motivating reconsideration of precision trade-offs in this domain.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) often
suffers from instability due to the numerical mismatch between the training and
inference policies. While prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue
through algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments, we show that its
root cause lies in the floating point precision itself. The widely adopted
BF16, despite its large dynamic range, introduces large rounding errors that
breaks the consistency between training and inference. In this work, we
demonstrate that simply reverting to \textbf{FP16} effectively eliminates this
mismatch. The change is simple, fully supported by modern frameworks with only
a few lines of code change, and requires no modification to the model
architecture or learning algorithm. Our results suggest that using FP16
uniformly yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger
performance across diverse tasks, algorithms and frameworks. We hope these
findings motivate a broader reconsideration of precision trade-offs in RL
fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores using Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) as an upstream filtering mechanism to improve robustness of ECG analysis in resource-constrained wearables against Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data like unseen pathologies and noise-corrupted signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuous ECG monitoring via wearables has potential for early CVD detection, but deep learning models face reliability challenges from OOD data that cause erroneous high-confidence predictions, compromising patient safety. Existing methods either neglect computational constraints or address noise and unseen classes separately.

Method: Benchmarked six UAD approaches (Deep SVDD, reconstruction-based models, Masked Anomaly Detection, normalizing flows, and diffusion models) optimized via Neural Architecture Search under strict resource constraints (≤512k parameters). Evaluated on PTB-XL and BUT QDB datasets for detecting OOD CVD classes and noisy signals.

Result: Deep SVDD consistently achieved the best trade-off between detection and efficiency. In realistic deployment simulation, integrating optimized Deep SVDD filter with diagnostic classifier improved accuracy by up to 21 percentage points over classifier-only baseline.

Conclusion: Optimized UAD filters can safeguard automated ECG analysis, enabling safer and more reliable continuous cardiovascular monitoring on wearables by effectively filtering out OOD data before classification.

Abstract: Continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring via wearables offers
significant potential for early cardiovascular disease (CVD) detection.
However, deploying deep learning models for automated analysis in
resource-constrained environments faces reliability challenges due to
inevitable Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. OOD inputs, such as unseen
pathologies or noisecorrupted signals, often cause erroneous, high-confidence
predictions by standard classifiers, compromising patient safety. Existing OOD
detection methods either neglect computational constraints or address noise and
unseen classes separately. This paper explores Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
(UAD) as an independent, upstream filtering mechanism to improve robustness. We
benchmark six UAD approaches, including Deep SVDD, reconstruction-based models,
Masked Anomaly Detection, normalizing flows, and diffusion models, optimized
via Neural Architecture Search (NAS) under strict resource constraints (at most
512k parameters). Evaluation on PTB-XL and BUT QDB datasets assessed detection
of OOD CVD classes and signals unsuitable for analysis due to noise. Results
show Deep SVDD consistently achieves the best trade-off between detection and
efficiency. In a realistic deployment simulation, integrating the optimized
Deep SVDD filter with a diagnostic classifier improved accuracy by up to 21
percentage points over a classifier-only baseline. This study demonstrates that
optimized UAD filters can safeguard automated ECG analysis, enabling safer,
more reliable continuous cardiovascular monitoring on wearables.

TL;DR: LLMs can serve as in-context meta-learners for model and hyperparameter selection by using dataset metadata, with zero-shot and meta-informed prompting strategies showing competitive performance without expensive search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model and hyperparameter selection is challenging and typically requires expert intuition or expensive automated search, creating a need for more efficient approaches.

Method: Convert datasets into interpretable metadata and prompt LLMs using two strategies: zero-shot (pretrained knowledge only) and meta-informed (augmented with examples of models and their past performance).

Result: LLMs can exploit dataset metadata to recommend competitive models and hyperparameters without search across synthetic and real-world benchmarks, with meta-informed prompting showing improvements.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise as lightweight, general-purpose assistants for model selection and hyperparameter optimization through in-context meta-learning capabilities.

Abstract: Model and hyperparameter selection are critical but challenging in machine
learning, typically requiring expert intuition or expensive automated search.
We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can act as in-context
meta-learners for this task. By converting each dataset into interpretable
metadata, we prompt an LLM to recommend both model families and
hyperparameters. We study two prompting strategies: (1) a zero-shot mode
relying solely on pretrained knowledge, and (2) a meta-informed mode augmented
with examples of models and their performance on past tasks. Across synthetic
and real-world benchmarks, we show that LLMs can exploit dataset metadata to
recommend competitive models and hyperparameters without search, and that
improvements from meta-informed prompting demonstrate their capacity for
in-context meta-learning. These results highlight a promising new role for LLMs
as lightweight, general-purpose assistants for model selection and
hyperparameter optimization.

TL;DR: ICPO is a new RLVR framework that uses in-context learning to provide expert guidance without needing advanced models, improving exploration and training stability for large reasoning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods like GRPO have limited exploration due to on-policy rollouts, and approaches using expert models are computationally expensive and inaccessible. ICPO addresses these limitations.

Method: ICPO introduces Mixed-Policy GRPO with Implicit Expert Forcing to expand exploration, Expert Region Reject Sampling to filter unreliable trajectories, and Annealed Expert-Bonus Reward Shaping to balance guidance.

Result: ICPO consistently enhances reinforcement learning performance and training stability on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: ICPO presents a scalable and effective RLVR paradigm for large reasoning models that doesn't require advanced expert models.

Abstract: Existing Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods, such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have achieved remarkable progress
in improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).
However, they exhibit limited exploration due to reliance on on-policy rollouts
where confined to the current policy's distribution, resulting in narrow
trajectory diversity. Recent approaches attempt to expand policy coverage by
incorporating trajectories generated from stronger expert models, yet this
reliance increases computational cost and such advaned models are often
inaccessible. To address these issues, we propose In-Context Steered Policy
Optimization (ICPO), a unified framework that leverages the inherent in-context
learning capability of LRMs to provide expert guidance using existing datasets.
ICPO introduces Mixed-Policy GRPO with Implicit Expert Forcing, which expands
exploration beyond the current policy distribution without requiring advanced
LRM trajectories. To further stabilize optimization, ICPO integrates Expert
Region Reject Sampling to filter unreliable off-policy trajectories and
Annealed Expert-Bonus Reward Shaping to balance early expert guidance with
later autonomous improvement. Results demonstrate that ICPO consistently
enhances reinforcement learning performance and training stability on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, revealing a scalable and effective RLVR
paradigm for LRMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a polybasic speculative decoding framework that accelerates LLM inference by extending beyond traditional dualistic draft-verify approaches, achieving 3.31-4.43x speedup across multiple models while preserving output distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference latency is a critical bottleneck in large-scale LLM deployment. Existing speculative decoding methods rely on dualistic draft-verify frameworks and lack rigorous theoretical grounding, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The authors propose a polybasic speculative decoding framework supported by comprehensive theoretical analysis. They prove a fundamental theorem characterizing optimal inference time for multi-model systems and optimize the interplay between model capabilities, acceptance lengths, and computational cost.

Result: Experimental results show speedup ratios of 3.31-4.01x for LLaMA2-Chat 7B, up to 3.87x for LLaMA3-8B, up to 4.43x for Vicuna-7B, and up to 3.85x for Qwen2-7B, all while preserving the original output distribution.

Conclusion: The polybasic speculative decoding framework provides significant acceleration for LLM inference and can be implemented standalone or integrated with existing techniques. The theoretical proofs and implementation code are released to support further research.

Abstract: Inference latency stands as a critical bottleneck in the large-scale
deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Speculative decoding methods have
recently shown promise in accelerating inference without compromising the
output distribution. However, existing work typically relies on a dualistic
draft-verify framework and lacks rigorous theoretical grounding. In this paper,
we introduce a novel \emph{polybasic} speculative decoding framework,
underpinned by a comprehensive theoretical analysis. Specifically, we prove a
fundamental theorem that characterizes the optimal inference time for
multi-model speculative decoding systems, shedding light on how to extend
beyond the dualistic approach to a more general polybasic paradigm. Through our
theoretical investigation of multi-model token generation, we expose and
optimize the interplay between model capabilities, acceptance lengths, and
overall computational cost. Our framework supports both standalone
implementation and integration with existing speculative techniques, leading to
accelerated performance in practice. Experimental results across multiple model
families demonstrate that our approach yields speedup ratios ranging from
$3.31\times$ to $4.01\times$ for LLaMA2-Chat 7B, up to $3.87 \times$ for
LLaMA3-8B, up to $4.43 \times$ for Vicuna-7B and up to $3.85 \times$ for
Qwen2-7B -- all while preserving the original output distribution. We release
our theoretical proofs and implementation code to facilitate further
investigation into polybasic speculative decoding.

TL;DR: Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL) is extended with theoretical guarantees for truncated versions, explicit convergence rates in supervised learning, and demonstrated strong empirical performance in active learning and non-geometric datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the theoretical foundation of HOHL beyond prior asymptotic consistency analysis, proving consistency of truncated versions and establishing explicit convergence rates for practical applications.

Method: Proving consistency of truncated HOHL, deriving explicit convergence rates when used as a regularizer in fully supervised learning, and empirical validation across diverse settings.

Result: Established theoretical guarantees for truncated HOHL, derived explicit convergence rates, and demonstrated strong empirical performance in active learning and datasets without underlying geometric structure.

Conclusion: HOHL shows versatility and robustness across diverse learning settings with solid theoretical foundations and strong empirical performance.

Abstract: Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL) was recently introduced as a
principled alternative to classical hypergraph regularization, enforcing
higher-order smoothness via powers of multiscale Laplacians induced by the
hypergraph structure. Prior work established the well- and ill-posedness of
HOHL through an asymptotic consistency analysis in geometric settings. We
extend this theoretical foundation by proving the consistency of a truncated
version of HOHL and deriving explicit convergence rates when HOHL is used as a
regularizer in fully supervised learning. We further demonstrate its strong
empirical performance in active learning and in datasets lacking an underlying
geometric structure, highlighting HOHL's versatility and robustness across
diverse learning settings.

*Aidan Furlong,Robert Salko,Xingang Zhao,Xu Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a staged Bayesian domain-adversarial neural network (staged B-DANN) that combines parameter transfer and shared latent space adaptation to improve transfer learning under domain shifts while providing uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks require large datasets but experimental data are often sparse and noisy. Transfer learning helps but parameter transfer degrades under large domain shifts, and existing domain-adversarial methods lack stability and uncertainty quantification.

Method: A three-stage framework: Stage 1 trains deterministic feature extractor on source domain; Stage 2 adversarially refines it using DANN; Stage 3 builds Bayesian neural network on adapted feature extractor for target domain fine-tuning with uncertainty estimation.

Result: Validated on synthetic benchmark showing significant improvement over standard transfer techniques. Applied to critical heat flux prediction in rectangular channels using tube experiment data as source domain, demonstrating improved predictive accuracy and generalization.

Conclusion: The staged B-DANN method improves predictive accuracy and generalization in transfer learning scenarios, particularly useful for nuclear engineering and other domains with domain shift challenges.

Abstract: The use of ML in engineering has grown steadily to support a wide array of
applications. Among these methods, deep neural networks have been widely
adopted due to their performance and accessibility, but they require large,
high-quality datasets. Experimental data are often sparse, noisy, or
insufficient to build resilient data-driven models. Transfer learning, which
leverages relevant data-abundant source domains to assist learning in
data-scarce target domains, has shown efficacy. Parameter transfer, where
pretrained weights are reused, is common but degrades under large domain
shifts. Domain-adversarial neural networks (DANNs) help address this issue by
learning domain-invariant representations, thereby improving transfer under
greater domain shifts in a semi-supervised setting. However, DANNs can be
unstable during training and lack a native means for uncertainty
quantification. This study introduces a fully-supervised three-stage framework,
the staged Bayesian domain-adversarial neural network (staged B-DANN), that
combines parameter transfer and shared latent space adaptation. In Stage 1, a
deterministic feature extractor is trained on the source domain. This feature
extractor is then adversarially refined using a DANN in Stage 2. In Stage 3, a
Bayesian neural network is built on the adapted feature extractor for
fine-tuning on the target domain to handle conditional shifts and yield
calibrated uncertainty estimates. This staged B-DANN approach was first
validated on a synthetic benchmark, where it was shown to significantly
outperform standard transfer techniques. It was then applied to the task of
predicting critical heat flux in rectangular channels, leveraging data from
tube experiments as the source domain. The results of this study show that the
staged B-DANN method can improve predictive accuracy and generalization,
potentially assisting other domains in nuclear engineering.

Motivation: There is a growing need for lightweight machine learning models that can be deployed on compute-constrained IoT devices to enable autonomous operation without constant communication or external energy supply.

Conclusion: The compression scheme enables IoT devices to operate autonomously with minimal computing power and energy, opening doors to applications like remote monitoring, edge analytics, and real-time decision making in isolated or power-limited environments.

Abstract: Deploying machine learning models on compute-constrained devices has become a
key building block of modern IoT applications. In this work, we present a
compression scheme for boosted decision trees, addressing the growing need for
lightweight machine learning models. Specifically, we provide techniques for
training compact boosted decision tree ensembles that exhibit a reduced memory
footprint by rewarding, among other things, the reuse of features and
thresholds during training. Our experimental evaluation shows that models
achieved the same performance with a compression ratio of 4-16x compared to
LightGBM models using an adapted training process and an alternative memory
layout. Once deployed, the corresponding IoT devices can operate independently
of constant communication or external energy supply, and, thus, autonomously,
requiring only minimal computing power and energy. This capability opens the
door to a wide range of IoT applications, including remote monitoring, edge
analytics, and real-time decision making in isolated or power-limited

### [135] [On Measuring Localization of Shortcuts in Deep Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26560)
*Nikita Tsoy,Nikola Konstantinov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Shortcuts (spurious rules) in deep networks are distributed throughout all layers rather than localized, with shallow layers encoding spurious features and deeper layers forgetting core features, making general shortcut-mitigation methods difficult to design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The impact of shortcuts on feature representations remains understudied, obstructing the design of principled shortcut-mitigation methods. This research aims to understand how shortcuts are localized across network layers.

Method: Novel experiment design quantifying layer-wise contribution to accuracy degradation through counterfactual training on clean and skewed datasets, tested on CIFAR-10, Waterbirds, and CelebA datasets across VGG, ResNet, DeiT, and ConvNeXt architectures.

Result: Shortcut learning is distributed throughout the network - shallow layers predominantly encode spurious features while deeper layers predominantly forget core features. Different network parts play different roles in shortcut learning.

Conclusion: The distributed nature of shortcut learning across network layers makes designing general shortcut-mitigation methods challenging, supporting dataset- and architecture-specific approaches instead.

Abstract: Shortcuts, spurious rules that perform well during training but fail to
generalize, present a major challenge to the reliability of deep networks
(Geirhos et al., 2020). However, the impact of shortcuts on feature
representations remains understudied, obstructing the design of principled
shortcut-mitigation methods. To overcome this limitation, we investigate the
layer-wise localization of shortcuts in deep models. Our novel experiment
design quantifies the layer-wise contribution to accuracy degradation caused by
a shortcut-inducing skew by counterfactual training on clean and skewed
datasets. We employ our design to study shortcuts on CIFAR-10, Waterbirds, and
CelebA datasets across VGG, ResNet, DeiT, and ConvNeXt architectures. We find
that shortcut learning is not localized in specific layers but distributed
throughout the network. Different network parts play different roles in this
process: shallow layers predominantly encode spurious features, while deeper
layers predominantly forget core features that are predictive on clean data. We
also analyze the differences in localization and describe its principal axes of
variation. Finally, our analysis of layer-wise shortcut-mitigation strategies
suggests the hardness of designing general methods, supporting dataset- and
architecture-specific approaches instead.

*Cesare Barbera,Lorenzo Perini,Giovanni De Toni,Andrea Passerini,Andrea Pugnana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces multiclass local calibration to address proximity bias in ML models, where predictions in sparse feature regions are systematically miscalibrated. It defines local calibration, analyzes existing metrics' pitfalls, proposes a method using Jensen-Shannon distance, and validates it empirically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multiclass calibration approaches lack distance awareness, making them vulnerable to proximity bias - predictions in sparse feature regions are systematically miscalibrated. This is critical in high-stakes settings like healthcare where sparse instances are most at risk of biased treatment.

Method: Proposes a practical method for enhancing local calibration in Neural Networks that enforces alignment between predicted probabilities and local estimates of class frequencies using the Jensen-Shannon distance.

Result: The approach is empirically validated against existing multiclass calibration techniques, showing improved performance in addressing proximity bias.

Conclusion: Multiclass local calibration provides a more robust framework for trustworthy ML by addressing the critical limitation of proximity bias in existing calibration methods, particularly important for high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Developing trustworthy Machine Learning (ML) models requires their predicted
probabilities to be well-calibrated, meaning they should reflect true-class
frequencies. Among calibration notions in multiclass classification, strong
calibration is the most stringent, as it requires all predicted probabilities
to be simultaneously calibrated across all classes. However, existing
approaches to multiclass calibration lack a notion of distance among inputs,
which makes them vulnerable to proximity bias: predictions in sparse regions of
the feature space are systematically miscalibrated. This is especially relevant
in high-stakes settings, such as healthcare, where the sparse instances are
exactly those most at risk of biased treatment. In this work, we address this
main shortcoming by introducing a local perspective on multiclass calibration.
First, we formally define multiclass local calibration and establish its
relationship with strong calibration. Second, we theoretically analyze the
pitfalls of existing evaluation metrics when applied to multiclass local
calibration. Third, we propose a practical method for enhancing local
calibration in Neural Networks, which enforces alignment between predicted
probabilities and local estimates of class frequencies using the Jensen-Shannon
distance. Finally, we empirically validate our approach against existing
multiclass calibration techniques.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new method for regression over distributions that combines Bernstein basis parameterization with Wasserstein distance minimization, modeling conditional distributions as smooth probability trajectories of Gaussian components whose parameters are Bernstein polynomial functions of inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for regression over distributions often ignore probability space geometry or are computationally expensive, creating a need for methods that balance geometric accuracy with practical computation.

Method: Parameterize probability trajectories using Bernstein basis and minimize Wasserstein distance between distributions. Model conditional distributions as weighted sums of Gaussian components with mean and covariance functions constructed via Bernstein polynomials. Use autodiff-based optimization for training.

Result: Competitive performance on synthetic datasets with complex trajectories, achieving good approximation quality in Wasserstein distance, Energy Distance, and RMSE metrics. Shows better trajectory smoothness and robustness to data structure changes while maintaining high interpretability.

Conclusion: The approach provides a balanced solution combining geometric accuracy, computational practicality, and interpretability. Future work includes extending to non-Gaussian distributions, applying entropy regularization, and adapting for high-dimensional data.

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of regression over distributions, which is
becoming increasingly important in machine learning. Existing approaches often
ignore the geometry of the probability space or are computationally expensive.
To overcome these limitations, a new method is proposed that combines the
parameterization of probability trajectories using a Bernstein basis and the
minimization of the Wasserstein distance between distributions. The key idea is
to model a conditional distribution as a smooth probability trajectory defined
by a weighted sum of Gaussian components whose parameters -- the mean and
covariance -- are functions of the input variable constructed using Bernstein
polynomials. The loss function is the averaged squared Wasserstein distance
between the predicted Gaussian distributions and the empirical data, which
takes into account the geometry of the distributions. An autodiff-based
optimization method is used to train the model. Experiments on synthetic
datasets that include complex trajectories demonstrated that the proposed
method provides competitive approximation quality in terms of the Wasserstein
distance, Energy Distance, and RMSE metrics, especially in cases of pronounced
nonlinearity. The model demonstrates trajectory smoothness that is better than
or comparable to alternatives and robustness to changes in data structure,
while maintaining high interpretability due to explicit parameterization via
control points. The developed approach represents a balanced solution that
combines geometric accuracy, computational practicality, and interpretability.
Prospects for further research include extending the method to non-Gaussian
distributions, applying entropy regularization to speed up computations, and
adapting the approach to working with high-dimensional data for approximating
surfaces and more complex structures.

Motivation: Existing flight delay datasets are limited to flat tabular structures and fail to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of delay propagation, creating a need for comprehensive multi-modal datasets.

Method: The dataset provides three aligned modalities: (1) tabular data with operational, meteorological, and airport features for 50+ million flights; (2) flight chain module modeling sequential delay propagation; (3) flight network graph encoding resource connections across flights.

Result: Aeolus enables realistic and reproducible ML evaluation with temporal splits, comprehensive features, and strict leakage prevention, supporting regression, classification, temporal modeling, and graph learning tasks.

Conclusion: Aeolus fills a key gap for both domain-specific flight delay modeling and general-purpose structured data research, providing a unified benchmark across tabular, sequential, and graph modalities.

Abstract: We introduce Aeolus, a large-scale Multi-modal Flight Delay Dataset designed
to advance research on flight delay prediction and support the development of
foundation models for tabular data. Existing datasets in this domain are
typically limited to flat tabular structures and fail to capture the
spatiotemporal dynamics inherent in delay propagation. Aeolus addresses this
limitation by providing three aligned modalities: (i) a tabular dataset with
rich operational, meteorological, and airportlevel features for over 50 million
flights; (ii) a flight chain module that models delay propagation along
sequential flight legs, capturing upstream and downstream dependencies; and
(iii) a flight network graph that encodes shared aircraft, crew, and airport
resource connections, enabling cross-flight relational reasoning. The dataset
is carefully constructed with temporal splits, comprehensive features, and
strict leakage prevention to support realistic and reproducible machine
learning evaluation. Aeolus supports a broad range of tasks, including
regression, classification, temporal structure modeling, and graph learning,
serving as a unified benchmark across tabular, sequential, and graph
modalities. We release baseline experiments and preprocessing tools to
facilitate adoption. Aeolus fills a key gap for both domain-specific modeling
and general-purpose structured data research.Our source code and data can be

### [139] [Omnipresent Yet Overlooked: Heat Kernels in Combinatorial Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26633)
*Colin Doumont,Victor Picheny,Viacheslav Borovitskiy,Henry Moss*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a unifying framework using heat kernels to understand relationships between various combinatorial kernels in Bayesian Optimization, showing many successful kernels are related to heat kernels and demonstrating state-of-the-art performance with a simple heat kernel-based pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian Optimization requires specialized kernels for combinatorial domains, but relationships between existing combinatorial kernels are not well understood, creating a gap in theoretical understanding.

Method: Developed a unifying framework based on heat kernels derived systematically with simple closed-form expressions, and validated through experiments comparing various combinatorial kernels.

Result: Proved that many successful combinatorial kernels are related or equivalent to heat kernels; heat kernels are not sensitive to optima location unlike some algorithms; simple heat kernel pipeline achieved state-of-the-art results matching or outperforming complex algorithms.

Conclusion: Heat kernels provide a unifying theoretical framework for combinatorial kernels in Bayesian Optimization and enable simple yet highly effective implementations that compete with more complex approaches.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has the potential to solve various combinatorial
tasks, ranging from materials science to neural architecture search. However,
BO requires specialized kernels to effectively model combinatorial domains.
Recent efforts have introduced several combinatorial kernels, but the
relationships among them are not well understood. To bridge this gap, we
develop a unifying framework based on heat kernels, which we derive in a
systematic way and express as simple closed-form expressions. Using this
framework, we prove that many successful combinatorial kernels are either
related or equivalent to heat kernels, and validate this theoretical claim in
our experiments. Moreover, our analysis confirms and extends the results
presented in Bounce: certain algorithms' performance decreases substantially
when the unknown optima of the function do not have a certain structure. In
contrast, heat kernels are not sensitive to the location of the optima. Lastly,
we show that a fast and simple pipeline, relying on heat kernels, is able to
achieve state-of-the-art results, matching or even outperforming certain slow
or complex algorithms.

*Emmanouil Sylligardos,John Paparrizos,Themis Palpanas,Pierre Senellart,Paul Boniol*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates time series classification methods for model selection in anomaly detection, showing they outperform individual anomaly detection methods while maintaining similar execution times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: No single best anomaly detection method exists for heterogeneous time series datasets, and existing AutoML solutions are not directly applicable to time series anomaly detection, creating a need for effective model selection approaches.

Method: Evaluated 234 model configurations from 16 base classifiers across 1980+ time series, conducting the first extensive experimental evaluation of time series classification as model selection for anomaly detection.

Result: Model selection methods outperform every single anomaly detection method while maintaining similar execution times, providing strong performance improvements.

Conclusion: Time series classification algorithms are accurate and efficient for anomaly detection model selection, establishing a strong baseline for guiding model selection in AutoML pipelines.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a fundamental task for time series analytics with
important implications for the downstream performance of many applications.
Despite increasing academic interest and the large number of methods proposed
in the literature, recent benchmarks and evaluation studies demonstrated that
no overall best anomaly detection methods exist when applied to very
heterogeneous time series datasets. Therefore, the only scalable and viable
solution to solve anomaly detection over very different time series collected
from diverse domains is to propose a model selection method that will select,
based on time series characteristics, the best anomaly detection methods to
run. Existing AutoML solutions are, unfortunately, not directly applicable to
time series anomaly detection, and no evaluation of time series-based
approaches for model selection exists. Towards that direction, this paper
studies the performance of time series classification methods used as model
selection for anomaly detection. In total, we evaluate 234 model configurations
derived from 16 base classifiers across more than 1980 time series, and we
propose the first extensive experimental evaluation of time series
classification as model selection for anomaly detection. Our results
demonstrate that model selection methods outperform every single anomaly
detection method while being in the same order of magnitude regarding execution
time. This evaluation is the first step to demonstrate the accuracy and
efficiency of time series classification algorithms for anomaly detection, and
represents a strong baseline that can then be used to guide the model selection
step in general AutoML pipelines. Preprint version of an article accepted at

### [141] [Curly Flow Matching for Learning Non-gradient Field Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26645)
*Katarina Petrović,Lazar Atanackovic,Viggo Moro,Kacper Kapuśniak,İsmail İlkan Ceylan,Michael Bronstein,Avishek Joey Bose,Alexander Tong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Curly Flow Matching (Curly-FM) is a novel method that learns non-gradient field dynamics for modeling periodic systems like cell cycles and fluid dynamics, overcoming limitations of existing gradient-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transport dynamics models rely on the principle of least action, which assumes gradient field dynamics and cannot capture non-gradient, periodic behavior found in real-world systems like cell cycles and ocean currents.

Method: Curly-FM solves a Schrödinger bridge problem with a non-zero drift reference process using inferred velocities and population snapshot data, enabling learning of non-gradient field dynamics.

Result: Curly-FM successfully learns trajectories that better match both reference processes and population marginals in single-cell RNA, computational fluid dynamics, and ocean current applications.

Conclusion: Curly-FM expands flow matching models beyond population modeling to capture known periodic behavior in physical systems, providing a more accurate framework for modeling non-gradient dynamics.

Abstract: Modeling the transport dynamics of natural processes from population-level
observations is a ubiquitous problem in the natural sciences. Such models rely
on key assumptions about the underlying process in order to enable faithful
learning of governing dynamics that mimic the actual system behavior. The de
facto assumption in current approaches relies on the principle of least action
that results in gradient field dynamics and leads to trajectories minimizing an
energy functional between two probability measures. However, many real-world
systems, such as cell cycles in single-cell RNA, are known to exhibit
non-gradient, periodic behavior, which fundamentally cannot be captured by
current state-of-the-art methods such as flow and bridge matching. In this
paper, we introduce Curly Flow Matching (Curly-FM), a novel approach that is
capable of learning non-gradient field dynamics by designing and solving a
Schr\"odinger bridge problem with a non-zero drift reference process -- in
stark contrast to typical zero-drift reference processes -- which is
constructed using inferred velocities in addition to population snapshot data.
We showcase Curly-FM by solving the trajectory inference problems for single
cells, computational fluid dynamics, and ocean currents with approximate
velocities. We demonstrate that Curly-FM can learn trajectories that better
match both the reference process and population marginals. Curly-FM expands
flow matching models beyond the modeling of populations and towards the
modeling of known periodic behavior in physical systems. Our code repository is

### [142] [Tight Differentially Private PCA via Matrix Coherence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26679)
*Tommaso d'Orsi,Gleb Novikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a simple and efficient differentially private algorithm for computing the span of top r singular vectors using SVD and standard perturbation mechanisms. The algorithm's error depends only on rank-r coherence and spectral gap, resolving an open question and outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of computing private rank-r approximations under differential privacy, particularly resolving the question posed by Hardt and Roth about achieving better error bounds that depend on coherence rather than worst-case matrix properties.

Method: The method uses singular value decomposition combined with standard perturbation mechanisms (likely Gaussian mechanism) to compute private rank-r approximations. The approach leverages the observation that rank-r coherence does not increase under Gaussian perturbations.

Result: The algorithm achieves error bounds that depend only on rank-r coherence and spectral gap, significantly outperforming prior private algorithms. In dense settings, it matches guarantees of optimal non-private algorithms for single-spike PCA in Wishart models, which prior private methods failed to achieve.

Conclusion: The proposed simple SVD-based approach with perturbation mechanisms provides optimal private rank-r approximations under coherence assumptions, resolving an open problem and enabling applications to graph problems like differentially private Max-Cut under low coherence.

Abstract: We revisit the task of computing the span of the top $r$ singular vectors
$u_1, \ldots, u_r$ of a matrix under differential privacy. We show that a
simple and efficient algorithm -- based on singular value decomposition and
standard perturbation mechanisms -- returns a private rank-$r$ approximation
whose error depends only on the \emph{rank-$r$ coherence} of $u_1, \ldots, u_r$
and the spectral gap $\sigma_r - \sigma_{r+1}$. This resolves a question posed
by Hardt and Roth~\cite{hardt2013beyond}. Our estimator outperforms the state
of the art -- significantly so in some regimes. In particular, we show that in
the dense setting, it achieves the same guarantees for single-spike PCA in the
Wishart model as those attained by optimal non-private algorithms, whereas
prior private algorithms failed to do so.
  In addition, we prove that (rank-$r$) coherence does not increase under
Gaussian perturbations. This implies that any estimator based on the Gaussian
mechanism -- including ours -- preserves the coherence of the input. We
conjecture that similar behavior holds for other structured models, including
planted problems in graphs.
  We also explore applications of coherence to graph problems. In particular,
we present a differentially private algorithm for Max-Cut and other constraint
satisfaction problems under low coherence assumptions.

*Amir Reza Mirzaei,Yuqiao Wen,Yanshuai Cao,Lili Mou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoRAQuant is a mixed-precision quantization method for LoRA adapters that uses SVD reparameterization to concentrate important information, enabling ultra-low bitwidth quantization while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multiple LoRA adapters are often loaded simultaneously for LLM customization, but their aggregate computational cost becomes substantial at scale despite each being lightweight individually.

Method: LoRAQuant reparameterizes each LoRA adapter using singular value decomposition (SVD) to concentrate important information into specific rows and columns, then applies mixed-precision quantization with higher precision for important components and ultra-low bitwidth for the rest.

Result: Experiments on LLaMA 2-7B, LLaMA 2-13B, and Mistral 7B models show LoRAQuant uses significantly lower bits than other quantization methods while achieving comparable or even higher performance on mathematical reasoning, coding, and summarization tasks.

Conclusion: LoRAQuant effectively reduces the computational cost of multiple LoRA adapters through intelligent mixed-precision quantization without sacrificing performance, making it suitable for large-scale deployment of customized LLMs.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular technique for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). In many
real-world scenarios, multiple adapters are loaded simultaneously to enable LLM
customization for personalized user experiences or to support a diverse range
of tasks. Although each adapter is lightweight in isolation, their aggregate
cost becomes substantial at scale. To address this, we propose LoRAQuant, a
mixed-precision post-training quantization method tailored to LoRA.
Specifically, LoRAQuant reparameterizes each adapter by singular value
decomposition (SVD) to concentrate the most important information into specific
rows and columns. This makes it possible to quantize the important components
to higher precision, while quantizing the rest to ultra-low bitwidth. We
conduct comprehensive experiments with LLaMA 2-7B, LLaMA 2-13B, and Mistral 7B
models on mathematical reasoning, coding, and summarization tasks. Results show
that our LoRAQuant uses significantly lower bits than other quantization
methods, but achieves comparable or even higher performance.

### [144] [How Regularization Terms Make Invertible Neural Networks Bayesian Point Estimators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26704)
*Nick Heilenkötter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces two regularization terms for invertible neural networks that enable the networks to approximate Bayesian point estimators (posterior mean and MAP) when inverted for solving inverse problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Invertible neural networks are promising for inverse problems due to their stability and interpretability, but existing optimization strategies have limitations in approximating Bayesian estimators. The authors aim to develop regularization methods that can recover properties of classical Bayesian point estimators.

Method: The authors introduce two specific regularization terms for training invertible neural networks. The first regularization term is designed to connect to the posterior mean estimator, while the second resembles the MAP estimator. They provide theoretical analysis characterizing how each loss function shapes both the learned forward operator and its inverse reconstruction map.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrate that these loss-term regularizers successfully introduce data-dependence in a stable and interpretable way, supporting the theoretical findings about how the regularization terms enable the networks to approximate Bayesian point estimators.

Conclusion: The proposed regularization framework for invertible neural networks provides a principled way to incorporate Bayesian estimation properties into neural network-based inverse problem solvers, maintaining the networks' inherent stability and interpretability while achieving data-dependent reconstruction performance comparable to classical Bayesian estimators.

Abstract: Can regularization terms in the training of invertible neural networks lead
to known Bayesian point estimators in reconstruction? Invertible networks are
attractive for inverse problems due to their inherent stability and
interpretability. Recently, optimization strategies for invertible neural
networks that approximate either a reconstruction map or the forward operator
have been studied from a Bayesian perspective, but each has limitations. To
address this, we introduce and analyze two regularization terms for the network
training that, upon inversion of the network, recover properties of classical
Bayesian point estimators: while the first can be connected to the posterior
mean, the second resembles the MAP estimator. Our theoretical analysis
characterizes how each loss shapes both the learned forward operator and its
inverse reconstruction map. Numerical experiments support our findings and
demonstrate how these loss-term regularizers introduce data-dependence in a
stable and interpretable way.

*Giulia DeSalvo,Clara Mohri,Mehryar Mohri,Yutao Zhong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces budgeted deferral framework to train deferral algorithms while minimizing expert query costs during training, proposing new algorithms for selective expert querying that reduce training costs without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard deferral training requires querying all experts for every training instance, which becomes prohibitively expensive when expert queries are costly, undermining the core goal of deferral to limit unnecessary expert usage.

Method: Proposed budgeted deferral framework with new algorithms for both two-stage and single-stage multiple-expert deferral settings that selectively query only a subset of experts per training example, balancing cost and predictive performance.

Result: Established theoretical guarantees including generalization bounds and label complexity analyses. Empirical results across several domains show substantial reduction in training costs without sacrificing prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: The budget-aware deferral algorithms demonstrate practical value by enabling effective deferral algorithm training while significantly reducing expert query costs during training.

Abstract: Learning to defer uncertain predictions to costly experts offers a powerful
strategy for improving the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning systems.
However, standard training procedures for deferral algorithms typically require
querying all experts for every training instance, an approach that becomes
prohibitively expensive when expert queries incur significant computational or
resource costs. This undermines the core goal of deferral: to limit unnecessary
expert usage. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the budgeted deferral
framework, which aims to train effective deferral algorithms while minimizing
expert query costs during training. We propose new algorithms for both
two-stage and single-stage multiple-expert deferral settings that selectively
query only a subset of experts per training example. While inspired by active
learning, our setting is fundamentally different: labels are already known, and
the core challenge is to decide which experts to query in order to balance cost
and predictive performance. We establish theoretical guarantees for both of our
algorithms, including generalization bounds and label complexity analyses.
Empirical results across several domains show that our algorithms substantially
reduce training costs without sacrificing prediction accuracy, demonstrating
the practical value of our budget-aware deferral algorithms.

*Chuyan Chen,Chenyang Ma,Zhangxin Li,Yutong He,Yanjie Dong,Kun Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARC-Top-K is a new gradient compression method that combines the benefits of Rand-K and Top-K by using sketches to align sparsity patterns across nodes, enabling efficient All-Reduce operations while maintaining strong convergence properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing gradient compressors have limitations: Rand-K performs poorly in practice by discarding structural information, while Top-K loses contraction property and requires costly All-Gather operations. There's a need for a compressor that preserves globally significant information while being efficient for distributed training.

Method: ARC-Top-K uses lightweight sketches of gradients to align sparsity patterns across nodes, enabling index-free All-Reduce operations. It preserves globally significant information and is combined with momentum error feedback (EF21M) for improved convergence.

Result: ARC-Top-K matches the accuracy of Top-K while reducing wall-clock training time by up to 60.7%. It achieves linear speedup and sharper convergence rates than original EF21M under standard assumptions.

Conclusion: ARC-Top-K offers an efficient and scalable solution that combines the robustness of Rand-K with the strong performance of Top-K, addressing communication bottlenecks in large-scale distributed machine learning.

Abstract: Communication remains a central bottleneck in large-scale distributed machine
learning, and gradient sparsification has emerged as a promising strategy to
alleviate this challenge. However, existing gradient compressors face notable
limitations: Rand-$K$\ discards structural information and performs poorly in
practice, while Top-$K$\ preserves informative entries but loses the
contraction property and requires costly All-Gather operations. In this paper,
we propose ARC-Top-$K$, an {All-Reduce}-Compatible Top-$K$ compressor that
aligns sparsity patterns across nodes using a lightweight sketch of the
gradient, enabling index-free All-Reduce while preserving globally significant
information. ARC-Top-$K$\ is provably contractive and, when combined with
momentum error feedback (EF21M), achieves linear speedup and sharper
convergence rates than the original EF21M under standard assumptions.
Empirically, ARC-Top-$K$\ matches the accuracy of Top-$K$\ while reducing
wall-clock training time by up to 60.7\%, offering an efficient and scalable
solution that combines the robustness of Rand-$K$\ with the strong performance
of Top-$K$.

*Jamie Lanyon,Axel Finke,Petros Andreou,Georgina Cosma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that evaluating machine unlearning algorithms using multiple runs from the same trained model can produce non-representative results due to high sensitivity to random training seeds, and recommends accounting for variability across different training seeds in empirical comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue that current empirical evaluations of machine unlearning algorithms may be misleading because they typically run multiple times from the same trained model, ignoring the significant variability introduced by different random seeds used during model training.

Method: The study analyzes the sensitivity of machine unlearning methods to random number seeds used in model training, showing that some methods exhibit high variability across different training seeds even for the same architecture and dataset.

Result: The research finds that common evaluation practices can produce highly non-representative results, as machine unlearning performance varies significantly depending on the initial training seed, making single-model comparisons potentially misleading.

Conclusion: Empirical comparisons of machine unlearning algorithms should incorporate variability across different model training seeds to provide more representative and reliable performance assessments.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of certain data points
from a trained model without costly retraining. Most practical MU algorithms
are only approximate and their performance can only be assessed empirically.
Care must therefore be taken to make empirical comparisons as representative as
possible. A common practice is to run the MU algorithm multiple times
independently starting from the same trained model. In this work, we
demonstrate that this practice can give highly non-representative results
because -- even for the same architecture and same dataset -- some MU methods
can be highly sensitive to the choice of random number seed used for model
training. We therefore recommend that empirical
comphttps://info.arxiv.org/help/prep#commentsarisons of MU algorithms should
also reflect the variability across different model training seeds.

*Tommaso d'Orsi,Gleb Novikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A simple perturbation mechanism for differentially private covariance matrix estimation that achieves optimal error bounds across various norms, with improved performance for both large and small datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a differentially private covariance matrix estimator that achieves optimal error guarantees across different matrix norms (Frobenius, spectral, and other p-Schatten norms) while being simple and efficient.

Method: Uses a perturbation mechanism for releasing d-dimensional covariance matrices under pure differential privacy. For small datasets (n < d²/ε), projects the output onto a nuclear norm ball of appropriate radius.

Result: For large datasets (n ≥ d²/ε), achieves optimal Frobenius norm error and best known error for all p-Schatten norms. For small datasets, achieves optimal Frobenius norm error O(√(d Tr(Σ)/n)), improving over previous bounds.

Conclusion: The proposed mechanism provides the first purely private covariance estimator achieving optimal error in spectral norm and improved error bounds across different dataset sizes, with information-theoretic optimality for p ≥ 2.

Abstract: We present a simple perturbation mechanism for the release of $d$-dimensional
covariance matrices $\Sigma$ under pure differential privacy. For large
datasets with at least $n\geq d^2/\varepsilon$ elements, our mechanism recovers
the provably optimal Frobenius norm error guarantees of
\cite{nikolov2023private}, while simultaneously achieving best known error for
all other $p$-Schatten norms, with $p\in [1,\infty]$. Our error is
information-theoretically optimal for all $p\ge 2$, in particular, our
mechanism is the first purely private covariance estimator that achieves
optimal error in spectral norm.
  For small datasets $n< d^2/\varepsilon$, we further show that by projecting
the output onto the nuclear norm ball of appropriate radius, our algorithm
achieves the optimal Frobenius norm error $O(\sqrt{d\;\text{Tr}(\Sigma) /n})$,
improving over the known bounds of $O(\sqrt{d/n})$ of \cite{nikolov2023private}
and ${O}\big(d^{3/4}\sqrt{\text{Tr}(\Sigma)/n}\big)$ of
\cite{dong2022differentially}.

*Muhammad Faraz Ul Abrar,Nicolò Michelusi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel over-the-air federated learning approach that allows structured, time-invariant model bias under heterogeneous wireless conditions, addressing limitations of prior zero-bias designs that were constrained by weakest devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OTA-FL designs enforce zero-bias model updates under homogeneous wireless assumptions or force zero-bias updates for convergence, which under heterogeneous scenarios constrains performance by weakest devices and inflates update variance. Prior analyses also mainly address convex objectives while modern AI models are non-convex.

Method: Developed OTA-FL SGD updates that allow structured, time-invariant model bias while reducing variance. Derived finite-time stationarity bound revealing bias-variance trade-off. Proposed non-convex joint OTA power-control design with efficient successive convex approximation algorithm using statistical CSI at base station.

Result: Experiments on non-convex image classification task validate the approach: SCA-based design accelerates convergence via optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed OTA-FL framework with structured bias and optimized power control effectively addresses wireless heterogeneity, achieving better convergence and generalization compared to existing zero-bias approaches.

Abstract: Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a
scalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless
multiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing
OTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming
\emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or
forcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \emph{heterogeneous}
wireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device
and inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL
largely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly
non-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless
heterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured,
time-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We
derive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient
norm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this
trade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an
efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only
statistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image
classification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates
convergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL
baselines.

*Marco Federici,Riccardo Del Chiaro,Boris van Breugel,Paul Whatmough,Markus Nagel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STaMP quantization uses sequence-level linear transformations and mixed precision to improve low-bit activation quantization by exploiting local correlations in language/visual data, maintaining accuracy with fewer high-precision tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantization reduces AI model inference costs but causes sharp accuracy degradation when activations are quantized below 8 bits. Recent work shows invertible transformations help, but existing methods focus on feature channels rather than sequence dimension.

Method: Apply linear transformations along sequence dimension to leverage strong local correlation in data. Keep small number of tokens at higher precision in intermediate activations while using lower precision for others.

Result: Significantly improves low bit width activation quantization on LVM and LLM architectures. Complements existing activation and weight quantization methods including recent feature transformations.

Conclusion: STaMP quantization effectively maintains model accuracy at lower average activation bit-widths by exploiting sequence-level correlations and strategic mixed precision allocation.

Abstract: Quantization is the key method for reducing inference latency, power and
memory footprint of generative AI models. However, accuracy often degrades
sharply when activations are quantized below eight bits. Recent work suggests
that invertible linear transformations (e.g. rotations) can aid quantization,
by reparameterizing feature channels and weights. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Sequence Transformation and Mixed Precision} (STaMP) quantization, a
novel strategy that applies linear transformations along the \textit{sequence}
dimension to exploit the strong local correlation in language and visual data.
By keeping a small number of tokens in each intermediate activation at higher
precision, we can maintain model accuracy at lower (average) activations
bit-widths. We evaluate STaMP on recent LVM and LLM architectures,
demonstrating that it significantly improves low bit width activation
quantization and complements established activation and weight quantization
methods including recent feature transformations.

*Jungyeon Koh,Hyeonsu Lyu,Jonggyu Jang,Hyun Jong Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes two advanced sampling techniques (feature-based and logit-based) to improve influence function estimations by selecting representative subsets of training data, reducing computational costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current influence function methods require computing Hessians for entire datasets, which is computationally expensive. Random sampling alternatives suffer from high variance and inconsistent estimates, creating a need for more efficient and reliable sampling approaches.

Method: Two advanced sampling techniques: feature-based and logit-based samplers that select small but representative subsets by considering the stochastic distribution of features or logits, enabling more accurate influence function estimations.

Result: The method reduces computation time by 30.1% and memory usage by 42.2%, or improves F1-score by 2.5% compared to baseline in class removal experiments, demonstrating effective model forgetting while maintaining inference consistency.

Conclusion: The proposed sampling techniques provide a practical solution for influence function estimation by balancing computational efficiency with estimation accuracy, making black-box model analysis more feasible and reliable.

Abstract: How can we explain the influence of training data on black-box models?
Influence functions (IFs) offer a post-hoc solution by utilizing gradients and
Hessians. However, computing the Hessian for an entire dataset is
resource-intensive, necessitating a feasible alternative. A common approach
involves randomly sampling a small subset of the training data, but this method
often results in highly inconsistent IF estimates due to the high variance in
sample configurations. To address this, we propose two advanced sampling
techniques based on features and logits. These samplers select a small yet
representative subset of the entire dataset by considering the stochastic
distribution of features or logits, thereby enhancing the accuracy of IF
estimations. We validate our approach through class removal experiments, a
typical application of IFs, using the F1-score to measure how effectively the
model forgets the removed class while maintaining inference consistency on the
remaining classes. Our method reduces computation time by 30.1% and memory
usage by 42.2%, or improves the F1-score by 2.5% compared to the baseline.

Motivation: To examine whether generalizable representations learned by time series forecasting foundation models can be effectively applied to classification tasks, challenging the assumption that task-specific pre-training is necessary.

Method: Compared different representation extraction strategies from frozen pre-trained forecasting models and introduced two model-agnostic embedding augmentations.

Result: Best forecasting models achieved classification accuracy matching or surpassing state-of-the-art models pre-trained specifically for classification, with a positive correlation observed between forecasting and classification performance.

Conclusion: Learning to forecast may provide a powerful route toward constructing general-purpose time series foundation models, challenging the need for task-specific pre-training.

Abstract: Recent research on time series foundation models has primarily focused on
forecasting, leaving it unclear how generalizable their learned representations
are. In this study, we examine whether frozen pre-trained forecasting models
can provide effective representations for classification. To this end, we
compare different representation extraction strategies and introduce two
model-agnostic embedding augmentations. Our experiments show that the best
forecasting models achieve classification accuracy that matches or even
surpasses that of state-of-the-art models pre-trained specifically for
classification. Moreover, we observe a positive correlation between forecasting
and classification performance. These findings challenge the assumption that
task-specific pre-training is necessary, and suggest that learning to forecast
may provide a powerful route toward constructing general-purpose time series
foundation models.

### [153] [Clone Deterministic 3D Worlds with Geometrically-Regularized World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26782)
*Zaishuo Xia,Yukuan Lu,Xinyi Li,Yifan Xu,Yubei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRWM improves world model performance by enforcing geometric regularization in latent representations, enabling more accurate long-horizon predictions in deterministic 3D environments without enlarging dynamics modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current world models degrade over long horizons due to poor representation quality from high-dimensional, lossy, or entangled latents that make dynamics learning difficult. The paper investigates whether improving representation learning alone can substantially enhance world-model performance.

Method: Proposes Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM) that enforce consecutive points along natural sensory trajectories to remain close in latent representation space. This plug-and-play approach requires minimal architectural modification and scales with trajectory length while being compatible with diverse latent generative backbones.

Result: GRWM significantly improves latent representations that align closely with the true topology of the environment. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks, it substantially increases rollout fidelity and stability. The benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric structure.

Conclusion: Improving representation learning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering reliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module. Geometric regularization effectively addresses the fundamental problem of constructing accurate world models for deterministic 3D environments.

Abstract: A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves.
Given past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the
embodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for
enabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic
settings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and
degrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation
quality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or
entangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask
whether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve
world-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly
accurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing
a model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We
propose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that
consecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent
representation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent
representations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.
GRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales
with trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative
backbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,
GRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that
its benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric
structure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation
learning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering
reliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.

### [154] [Learning Pseudorandom Numbers with Transformers: Permuted Congruential Generators, Curricula, and Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26792)
*Tao Tao,Maissam Barkeshli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers can learn to predict sequences from Permuted Congruential Generators (PCGs), a complex class of PRNGs, even with single-bit outputs and large moduli up to 2^22, showing scaling laws and requiring curriculum learning for larger moduli.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate Transformer models' capability to learn complex pseudo-random number generator sequences, specifically PCGs which add significant difficulty over simpler LCGs through bit-wise operations, and understand their scaling behavior and learning mechanisms.

Method: Train Transformer models on sequences generated by diverse PCG variants, scaling up to 50M parameters and 5B tokens, testing prediction on unseen sequences, analyzing scaling laws, and examining embedding representations through clustering analysis.

Result: Transformers successfully predict PCG sequences beyond classical attacks, even with single-bit outputs, learn multiple PRNGs jointly, follow sqrt(m) scaling law for required context length, require curriculum learning for large moduli (≥2^20), and exhibit spontaneous clustering of integer inputs into bitwise rotationally-invariant groups.

Conclusion: Transformers demonstrate remarkable capability to learn complex PRNG patterns, revealing fundamental scaling properties and novel representation learning phenomena that enable knowledge transfer across different modulus sizes, with implications for understanding neural network generalization and cryptographic analysis.

Abstract: We study the ability of Transformer models to learn sequences generated by
Permuted Congruential Generators (PCGs), a widely used family of pseudo-random
number generators (PRNGs). PCGs introduce substantial additional difficulty
over linear congruential generators (LCGs) by applying a series of bit-wise
shifts, XORs, rotations and truncations to the hidden state. We show that
Transformers can nevertheless successfully perform in-context prediction on
unseen sequences from diverse PCG variants, in tasks that are beyond published
classical attacks. In our experiments we scale moduli up to $2^{22}$ using up
to $50$ million model parameters and datasets with up to $5$ billion tokens.
Surprisingly, we find even when the output is truncated to a single bit, it can
be reliably predicted by the model. When multiple distinct PRNGs are presented
together during training, the model can jointly learn them, identifying
structures from different permutations. We demonstrate a scaling law with
modulus $m$: the number of in-context sequence elements required for
near-perfect prediction grows as $\sqrt{m}$. For larger moduli, optimization
enters extended stagnation phases; in our experiments, learning moduli $m \geq
2^{20}$ requires incorporating training data from smaller moduli, demonstrating
a critical necessity for curriculum learning. Finally, we analyze embedding
layers and uncover a novel clustering phenomenon: the model spontaneously
groups the integer inputs into bitwise rotationally-invariant clusters,
revealing how representations can transfer from smaller to larger moduli.

### [155] [Towards Piece-by-Piece Explanations for Chess Positions with SHAP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25775)
*Francesco Spinnato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper adapts SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to chess analysis to attribute engine evaluations to specific pieces, making AI chess analysis more interpretable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current chess engines provide opaque centipawn evaluations that don't reveal which pieces contribute to the score. The research aims to make these evaluations transparent by showing individual piece contributions.

Method: The approach treats chess pieces as features and systematically ablates them to compute SHAP values, attributing the engine's evaluation score to specific pieces in an additive, interpretable manner.

Result: The method successfully provides locally faithful and human-interpretable piece-by-piece explanations of chess engine evaluations, bridging classical chess thinking with modern explainable AI techniques.

Conclusion: This SHAP-based approach enables new possibilities for visualization, human training, and engine comparison in chess AI, with released code and data to support future interpretable AI research.

Abstract: Contemporary chess engines offer precise yet opaque evaluations, typically
expressed as centipawn scores. While effective for decision-making, these
outputs obscure the underlying contributions of individual pieces or patterns.
In this paper, we explore adapting SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to the
domain of chess analysis, aiming to attribute a chess engines evaluation to
specific pieces on the board. By treating pieces as features and systematically
ablating them, we compute additive, per-piece contributions that explain the
engines output in a locally faithful and human-interpretable manner. This
method draws inspiration from classical chess pedagogy, where players assess
positions by mentally removing pieces, and grounds it in modern explainable AI
techniques. Our approach opens new possibilities for visualization, human
training, and engine comparison. We release accompanying code and data to
foster future research in interpretable chess AI.

### [157] [Through the Judge's Eyes: Inferred Thinking Traces Improve Reliability of LLM Raters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25860)
*Xingjian Zhang,Tianhong Gao,Suliang Jin,Tianhao Wang,Teng Ye,Eytan Adar,Qiaozhu Mei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A human-LLM collaborative framework that infers thinking traces from label-only annotations using rejection sampling, then applies these traces to improve LLM raters through fine-tuning and better annotation guidelines, significantly increasing LLM-human agreement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used as raters but lack reliability for subjective tasks where human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond simple labels. Thinking traces (the reasoning behind judgments) are highly informative but difficult to collect.

Method: Human-LLM collaborative framework using rejection sampling to reconstruct thinking traces from label-only annotations. These traces are then used to fine-tune open LLM raters and synthesize clearer annotation guidelines for proprietary LLM raters.

Result: Significantly improved LLM-human agreement across multiple datasets. Refined annotation guidelines also increased agreement among different LLM models.

Conclusion: LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance LLM rater reliability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as raters for evaluation
tasks. However, their reliability is often limited for subjective tasks, when
human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond annotation labels. Thinking
traces, the reasoning behind a judgment, are highly informative but challenging
to collect and curate. We present a human-LLM collaborative framework to infer
thinking traces from label-only annotations. The proposed framework uses a
simple and effective rejection sampling method to reconstruct these traces at
scale. These inferred thinking traces are applied to two complementary tasks:
(1) fine-tuning open LLM raters; and (2) synthesizing clearer annotation
guidelines for proprietary LLM raters. Across multiple datasets, our methods
lead to significantly improved LLM-human agreement. Additionally, the refined
annotation guidelines increase agreement among different LLM models. These
results suggest that LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise
unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended
into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM
raters.

### [158] [The Information-Theoretic Imperative: Compression and the Epistemic Foundations of Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25883)
*Christian Dittrich,Jennifer Flygare Kinne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a two-level framework (ITI and CEP) explaining why compression leads to discovery of causal structure rather than superficial patterns, arguing that intelligence emerges mechanically from persistence in structured environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address why compression processes enforce discovery of causal structure rather than superficial statistical patterns, which existing frameworks leave underspecified.

Method: Introduces a two-level framework: Information-Theoretic Imperative (ITI) establishes evolutionary pressure for predictive compression, and Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression selects for generative causal models through exception-accumulation dynamics.

Result: The framework yields testable predictions including correlation between compression efficiency and out-of-distribution generalization, differentiation of causal vs correlational models via exception-accumulation rates, hierarchical efficiency patterns, and metabolic cost tracking of representational complexity.

Conclusion: ITI and CEP provide a unified account of intelligence convergence across biological, artificial, and multi-scale systems, showing intelligence as mechanically necessary outcome of persistence in structured environments without invoking consciousness assumptions.

Abstract: Existing frameworks converge on the centrality of compression to intelligence
but leave underspecified why this process enforces the discovery of causal
structure rather than superficial statistical patterns. We introduce a
two-level framework to address this gap. The Information-Theoretic Imperative
(ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must
minimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the
evolutionary "why" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands.
The Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression
mechanically selects for generative, causal models through
exception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather
than a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain:
from survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement,
efficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality
alignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or
evolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically
necessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework
yields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as
approach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution
generalization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from
correlational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across
abstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that
track representational complexity. ITI and CEP thereby provide a unified
account of convergence across biological, artificial, and multi-scale systems,
addressing the epistemic and functional dimensions of intelligence without
invoking assumptions about consciousness or subjective experience.

*Eitán Sprejer,Fernando Avalos,Augusto Bernardi,Jose Pedro Brito de Azevedo Faustino,Jacob Haimes,Narmeen Fatimah Oozeer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework for aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences using persona-based aggregation of multiple rubric-conditioned judges to address calibration, bias, and stability issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based judges are difficult to calibrate and suffer from rubric sensitivity, bias, and instability, which hinders applications like RLHF reward models and model routing systems.

Method: Proposes a persona-based preference modeling framework that learns to aggregate outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges using two implementations: Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

Result: The approach was evaluated against naive baselines and assessed for robustness through case studies on human and LLM-judge biases.

Conclusion: The framework provides a method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and offers two distinct aggregator implementations to improve alignment of LLM-based judges with human preferences.

Abstract: Aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences is a significant challenge,
as they are difficult to calibrate and often suffer from rubric sensitivity,
bias, and instability. Overcoming this challenge advances key applications,
such as creating reliable reward models for Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and building effective routing systems that select the
best-suited model for a given user query. In this work, we propose a framework
for modeling diverse, persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate
outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. We investigate the performance
of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case
studies on both human and LLM-judges biases. Our primary contributions include
a persona-based method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and two
distinct implementations of our aggregator: Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address trustworthiness concerns of LLMs in high-stakes scientific applications where reliability and safety are critical.

Method: Developed comprehensive evaluation framework with novel truthfulness benchmarks using reflection-tuning pipeline and expert validation, plus ethics benchmark covering 8 subcategories. Evaluated 7 LLMs using multiple metrics including accuracy, semantic similarity, and LLM-based scoring.

Result: General-purpose industry models outperformed science-specialized models across all trustworthiness dimensions. GPT-4-mini showed superior truthfulness and adversarial robustness. Science-specialized models had significant deficiencies in logical/ethical reasoning and concerning safety vulnerabilities in high-risk domains.

Conclusion: The framework provides foundation for developing more trustworthy AI systems and advancing research on model safety and ethics in scientific contexts. Framework is open-sourced to support community development.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in
scientific research, yet their deployment in high-stakes contexts raises
significant trustworthiness concerns. Here, we introduce SciTrust 2.0, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating LLM trustworthiness in scientific
applications across four dimensions: truthfulness, adversarial robustness,
scientific safety, and scientific ethics. Our framework incorporates novel,
open-ended truthfulness benchmarks developed through a verified
reflection-tuning pipeline and expert validation, alongside a novel ethics
benchmark for scientific research contexts covering eight subcategories
including dual-use research and bias. We evaluated seven prominent LLMs,
including four science-specialized models and three general-purpose industry
models, using multiple evaluation metrics including accuracy, semantic
similarity measures, and LLM-based scoring. General-purpose industry models
overall outperformed science-specialized models across each trustworthiness
dimension, with GPT-o4-mini demonstrating superior performance in truthfulness
assessments and adversarial robustness. Science-specialized models showed
significant deficiencies in logical and ethical reasoning capabilities, along
with concerning vulnerabilities in safety evaluations, particularly in
high-risk domains such as biosecurity and chemical weapons. By open-sourcing
our framework, we provide a foundation for developing more trustworthy AI
systems and advancing research on model safety and ethics in scientific
contexts.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using autonomous AI agents to automate FinOps (cloud financial operations) by addressing the challenge of heterogeneous billing data from multiple cloud providers, demonstrating successful implementation through a simulated industry process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FinOps practitioners face challenges with heterogeneous billing data formats, taxonomies, and metrics from multiple cloud providers and internal systems, making it difficult to synthesize actionable insights and make time-sensitive decisions.

Method: Built a FinOps agent for IT infrastructure and cost optimization using a system that simulates realistic end-to-end industry processes - from retrieving data from various sources to consolidating and analyzing data to generate optimization recommendations.

Result: The agent was evaluated using multiple open-source and closed-source language models with defined metrics, showing it could understand, plan, and execute tasks as effectively as an actual FinOps practitioner.

Conclusion: Autonomous, goal-driven AI agents can successfully automate FinOps processes and perform at the level of human practitioners, addressing the fundamental challenge of heterogeneous cloud billing data.

Abstract: FinOps (Finance + Operations) represents an operational framework and
cultural practice which maximizes cloud business value through collaborative
financial accountability across engineering, finance, and business teams.
FinOps practitioners face a fundamental challenge: billing data arrives in
heterogeneous formats, taxonomies, and metrics from multiple cloud providers
and internal systems which eventually lead to synthesizing actionable insights,
and making time-sensitive decisions. To address this challenge, we propose
leveraging autonomous, goal-driven AI agents for FinOps automation. In this
paper, we built a FinOps agent for a typical use-case for IT infrastructure and
cost optimization. We built a system simulating a realistic end-to-end industry
process starting with retrieving data from various sources to consolidating and
analyzing the data to generate recommendations for optimization. We defined a
set of metrics to evaluate our agent using several open-source and close-source
language models and it shows that the agent was able to understand, plan, and
execute tasks as well as an actual FinOps practitioner.

*Nissan Yaron,Dan Bystritsky,Ben-Etzion Yaron*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A 3.8B model called Humans-Junior achieves GPT-4o-level performance on FACTS Grounding benchmark within ±5 pp equivalence margin, with approximately 19× lower cloud costs and potential for near-zero marginal cost in self-hosted deployments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that small language models can achieve performance comparable to much larger frontier models like GPT-4o on factual grounding tasks while offering significant cost advantages, making AI more accessible and cost-efficient.

Method: Combines minimal directed "Exoskeleton Reasoning" scaffolds with behavioral fine-tuning that teaches protocol compliance (epistemic discipline) rather than domain-specific answers. The approach synergizes reasoning scaffolds with fine-tuning for improved performance.

Result: Humans-Junior (3.8B) scores 72.7% vs GPT-4o's 73.5% on Q1-Q500, with paired difference of 0.8 pp (not statistically significant). The combination of reasoning scaffolds and fine-tuning provides +17.7 pp improvement (p < 0.001) and reduces variance by ≈25%. In prompt-only settings, directed reasoning improved GPT-4o by +11.8 pp and Gemini-2.5-Pro by +5.0 pp.

Conclusion: Small language models can achieve performance comparable to frontier models on factual grounding tasks when combined with appropriate reasoning scaffolds and behavioral fine-tuning, while offering substantial cost advantages (≈19× lower cloud costs and near-zero marginal costs for self-hosted deployments).

Abstract: We introduce Humans-Junior, a 3.8B model that matches GPT-4o on the FACTS
Grounding public subset within a $\pm 5$ pp equivalence margin.
  Results. On Q1--Q500 under identical judges, GPT-4o scores 73.5% (95% CI
69.5--77.2) and Humans-Junior 72.7% (95% CI 68.7--76.5); the paired difference
is 0.8 pp (bootstrap 95% CI $-3.1$ to $+4.7$; permutation $p = 0.72$; Cohen's
$d = 0.023$). TOST establishes equivalence at $\pm 5$ pp (not at $\pm 3$ pp).
When purchased as managed APIs, Humans-Junior's base model
(Phi-3.5-mini-instruct) is $\approx 19\times$ less expensive than GPT-4o on
Microsoft AI Foundry pricing; self-hosted or edge deployments can drive
incremental inference cost toward zero. Measured vs estimated pricing sources
are tabulated in Appendix E.
  Method. Our approach combines minimal directed "Exoskeleton Reasoning"
scaffolds with behavioral fine-tuning that teaches protocol compliance
(epistemic discipline) rather than domain answers. Fine-tuning alone adds
little; combined, they synergize (+17.7 pp, $p < 0.001$) and reduce variance
($\approx 25\%$). In prompt-only settings on frontier models (Q1--Q100;
non-comparable), directed reasoning improved GPT-4o by +11.8 pp to 85.3% and
Gemini-2.5-Pro by +5.0 pp to 93.3% (baseline 88.3%, $n = 100$); see Section~5.
  TL;DR. A 3.8B model achieves GPT-4o-level FACTS accuracy (equivalent within
$\pm 5$ pp on Q1--Q500). Cloud pricing shows $\approx 19\times$ lower cost
versus GPT-4o, and self-hosted/edge deployments can approach zero marginal
cost. Pricing sources are listed in Appendix E. Frontier prompt-only gains

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces attention-aware inverse planning to estimate people's cognitive biases from their actions, showing how it differs from standard inverse reinforcement learning and demonstrating its application in real-life driving scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: People's goal-directed behaviors are influenced by cognitive biases, and autonomous systems interacting with humans need to be aware of these biases to better understand and predict human behavior.

Method: The authors combine deep reinforcement learning with computational cognitive modeling to develop an approach for attention-aware inverse planning, which estimates attentional biases from observed actions.

Result: The approach successfully infers attentional strategies of reinforcement learning agents in real-life driving scenarios from the Waymo Open Dataset, demonstrating the scalability of estimating cognitive biases.

Conclusion: Attention-aware inverse planning provides a systematic framework for inferring cognitive biases from behavior and can be effectively applied to complex real-world scenarios like driving.

Abstract: People's goal-directed behaviors are influenced by their cognitive biases,
and autonomous systems that interact with people should be aware of this. For
example, people's attention to objects in their environment will be biased in a
way that systematically affects how they perform everyday tasks such as driving
to work. Here, building on recent work in computational cognitive science, we
formally articulate the attention-aware inverse planning problem, in which the
goal is to estimate a person's attentional biases from their actions. We
demonstrate how attention-aware inverse planning systematically differs from
standard inverse reinforcement learning and how cognitive biases can be
inferred from behavior. Finally, we present an approach to attention-aware
inverse planning that combines deep reinforcement learning with computational
cognitive modeling. We use this approach to infer the attentional strategies of
RL agents in real-life driving scenarios selected from the Waymo Open Dataset,
demonstrating the scalability of estimating cognitive biases with
attention-aware inverse planning.

TL;DR: An agentic pipeline enhances NL-to-SQL systems for spatio-temporal queries by using a ReAct agent to plan, decompose, and adapt queries through schema inspection, SQL generation, execution, and visualization tools, achieving 91.4% accuracy vs 28.6% baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NL-to-SQL systems struggle with realistic spatio-temporal queries that require aligning vague user phrasing with schema-specific categories, handling temporal reasoning, and choosing appropriate outputs.

Method: Extends a naive text-to-SQL baseline with orchestration by a Mistral-based ReAct agent that can plan, decompose, and adapt queries through schema inspection, SQL generation, execution, and visualization tools.

Result: Achieved substantially higher accuracy than naive baseline (91.4% vs. 28.6%) on 35 natural-language queries over NYC and Tokyo check-in dataset, with enhanced usability through maps, plots, and structured natural-language summaries.

Conclusion: Agentic orchestration, rather than stronger SQL generators alone, is a promising foundation for interactive geospatial assistants that enable more natural human-database interaction for users lacking SQL expertise, schema knowledge, or prompting skills.

Abstract: Natural-language-to-SQL (NL-to-SQL) systems hold promise for democratizing
access to structured data, allowing users to query databases without learning
SQL. Yet existing systems struggle with realistic spatio-temporal queries,
where success requires aligning vague user phrasing with schema-specific
categories, handling temporal reasoning, and choosing appropriate outputs. We
present an agentic pipeline that extends a naive text-to-SQL baseline
(llama-3-sqlcoder-8b) with orchestration by a Mistral-based ReAct agent. The
agent can plan, decompose, and adapt queries through schema inspection, SQL
generation, execution, and visualization tools. We evaluate on 35
natural-language queries over the NYC and Tokyo check-in dataset, covering
spatial, temporal, and multi-dataset reasoning. The agent achieves
substantially higher accuracy than the naive baseline 91.4% vs. 28.6% and
enhances usability through maps, plots, and structured natural-language
summaries. Crucially, our design enables more natural human-database
interaction, supporting users who lack SQL expertise, detailed schema
knowledge, or prompting skill. We conclude that agentic orchestration, rather
than stronger SQL generators alone, is a promising foundation for interactive
geospatial assistants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of research literature, especially in LLMs, makes producing current and comprehensive survey papers increasingly difficult.

Method: Multi-stage pipeline with parallel section generation, iterative refinement, real-time retrieval of recent publications, and multi-LLM evaluation framework for quality assessment.

Result: autosurvey2 consistently outperforms existing retrieval-based and automated baselines, achieving higher scores in structural coherence and topical relevance while maintaining strong citation fidelity.

Conclusion: autosurvey2 provides a scalable and reproducible solution for generating long-form academic surveys and contributes a foundation for future research on automated scholarly writing.

Abstract: The rapid growth of research literature, particularly in large language
models (LLMs), has made producing comprehensive and current survey papers
increasingly difficult. This paper introduces autosurvey2, a multi-stage
pipeline that automates survey generation through retrieval-augmented synthesis
and structured evaluation. The system integrates parallel section generation,
iterative refinement, and real-time retrieval of recent publications to ensure
both topical completeness and factual accuracy. Quality is assessed using a
multi-LLM evaluation framework that measures coverage, structure, and relevance
in alignment with expert review standards. Experimental results demonstrate
that autosurvey2 consistently outperforms existing retrieval-based and
automated baselines, achieving higher scores in structural coherence and

### [166] [Large Language Model-assisted Autonomous Vehicle Recovery from Immobilization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26023)
*Zhipeng Bao,Qianwen Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StuckSolver is an LLM-driven framework that helps autonomous vehicles recover from immobilization scenarios through self-reasoning and passenger guidance, operating as a plug-in module without modifying the AV's core architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AV recovery solutions like remote intervention and manual takeover are inadequate - remote intervention is costly and inefficient, while manual takeover excludes non-drivers and limits accessibility. AVs often get stuck in scenarios where human drivers excel.

Method: StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on module that interfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states, interpret environmental context, and generate high-level recovery commands for the AV's native planner, requiring no modification to the AV's internal architecture.

Result: Evaluation on Bench2Drive benchmark and custom uncertainty scenarios shows StuckSolver achieves near-state-of-the-art performance through autonomous self-reasoning alone, with further improvements when passenger guidance is incorporated.

Conclusion: StuckSolver provides an effective solution for AV immobilization recovery through LLM-driven reasoning and passenger collaboration, enhancing AV accessibility and traffic flow without requiring architectural changes to existing systems.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in recent decades, autonomous vehicles (AVs)
continue to face challenges in navigating certain traffic scenarios where human
drivers excel. In such situations, AVs often become immobilized, disrupting
overall traffic flow. Current recovery solutions, such as remote intervention
(which is costly and inefficient) and manual takeover (which excludes
non-drivers and limits AV accessibility), are inadequate. This paper introduces
StuckSolver, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) driven recovery framework that
enables AVs to resolve immobilization scenarios through self-reasoning and/or
passenger-guided decision-making. StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on
module that operates on top of the AV's existing perception-planning-control
stack, requiring no modification to its internal architecture. Instead, it
interfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states,
interpret environmental context, and generate high-level recovery commands that
can be executed by the AV's native planner. We evaluate StuckSolver on the
Bench2Drive benchmark and in custom-designed uncertainty scenarios. Results
show that StuckSolver achieves near-state-of-the-art performance through
autonomous self-reasoning alone and exhibits further improvements when
passenger guidance is incorporated.

### [167] [Can AI be Accountable?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26057)
*Andrew L. Kun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper discusses the need for AI accountability, defining accountability as the ability for forums to request information, discuss actions, and sanction AI agents, and explores approaches to make AI accountable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI becomes increasingly powerful, it's crucial that it serves the needs of consumers, voters, and decision makers, which requires AI to be accountable to those affected by its actions.

Method: The paper relates general accountability definitions to AI, illustrates what accountable and unaccountable AI looks like, and explores various approaches to improve AI accountability.

Result: The analysis shows that current AI often lacks accountability mechanisms - we cannot question it, discuss its actions, or sanction it when necessary.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of developing approaches to ensure all AI becomes accountable to those affected by it, creating a world where powerful AI serves human needs responsibly.

Abstract: The AI we use is powerful, and its power is increasing rapidly. If this
powerful AI is to serve the needs of consumers, voters, and decision makers,
then it is imperative that the AI is accountable. In general, an agent is
accountable to a forum if the forum can request information from the agent
about its actions, if the forum and the agent can discuss this information, and
if the forum can sanction the agent. Unfortunately, in too many cases today's
AI is not accountable -- we cannot question it, enter into a discussion with
it, let alone sanction it. In this chapter we relate the general definition of
accountability to AI, we illustrate what it means for AI to be accountable and
unaccountable, and we explore approaches that can improve our chances of living
in a world where all AI is accountable to those who are affected by it.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Lean4PHYS is a framework for formal physics reasoning in Lean4, featuring LeanPhysBench (200 college-level physics problems) and PhysLib (foundational physics theorems). Current AI models achieve low performance (16-35%), showing the benchmark's difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create the first comprehensive benchmark for formal physics reasoning in Lean4, addressing the lack of standardized evaluation for physics theorem proving and enabling systematic assessment of AI reasoning capabilities in physics.

Method: Developed LeanPhysBench with 200 hand-crafted physics statements from university textbooks and competitions, created PhysLib as a community-driven repository of fundamental physics theorems and unit systems, and evaluated major Lean4 provers and AI models.

Result: Best performance was 16% by DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B and 35% by Claude-Sonnet-4, showing the benchmark's difficulty. PhysLib improved model performance by average 11.75%.

Conclusion: Lean4PHYS provides a challenging benchmark for physics reasoning, demonstrating both the difficulty of formal physics theorem proving and the effectiveness of foundational physics libraries in improving AI performance.

Abstract: We present **Lean4PHYS**, a comprehensive reasoning framework for
college-level physics problems in Lean4. **Lean4PHYS** includes
*LeanPhysBench*, a college-level benchmark for formal physics reasoning in
Lean4, which contains 200 hand-crafted and peer-reviewed statements derived
from university textbooks and physics competition problems. To establish a
solid foundation for formal reasoning in physics, we also introduce *PhysLib*,
a community-driven repository containing fundamental unit systems and theorems
essential for formal physics reasoning. Based on the benchmark and Lean4
repository we composed in **Lean4PHYS**, we report baseline results using major
expert Math Lean4 provers and state-of-the-art closed-source models, with the
best performance of DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieving only 16% and
Claude-Sonnet-4 achieving 35%. We also conduct a detailed analysis showing that
our *PhysLib* can achieve an average improvement of 11.75% in model
performance. This demonstrates the challenging nature of our *LeanPhysBench*
and the effectiveness of *PhysLib*. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study to provide a physics benchmark in Lean4.

*Chenrui Shi,Zedong Yu,Zhi Gao,Ruining Feng,Enqi Liu,Yuwei Wu,Yunde Jia,Liuyu Xiang,Zhaofeng He,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper analyzes gaps in GUI task automation by large vision language models (VLMs) and identifies three core dimensions of GUI knowledge that current models lack: interface perception, interaction prediction, and instruction understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand why VLMs lag behind humans in GUI task automation and to address the gap caused by missing core GUI knowledge that existing training schemes cannot fully provide.

Method: The authors analyzed common failure patterns in GUI task execution and distilled GUI knowledge into three dimensions. They created GUI Knowledge Bench, a benchmark with multiple choice and yes/no questions across six platforms and 292 applications to evaluate VLMs.

Result: Evaluation shows current VLMs can identify widget functions but struggle with perceiving system states, predicting actions, and verifying task completion. Experiments on real-world GUI tasks validate the close link between GUI knowledge and task success.

Conclusion: The work provides a structured framework for assessing GUI knowledge, supporting VLM selection before downstream training and offering insights for building more capable GUI agents.

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) have advanced graphical user interface
(GUI) task automation but still lag behind humans. We hypothesize this gap
stems from missing core GUI knowledge, which existing training schemes (such as
supervised fine tuning and reinforcement learning) alone cannot fully address.
By analyzing common failure patterns in GUI task execution, we distill GUI
knowledge into three dimensions: (1) interface perception, knowledge about
recognizing widgets and system states; (2) interaction prediction, knowledge
about reasoning action state transitions; and (3) instruction understanding,
knowledge about planning, verifying, and assessing task completion progress. We
further introduce GUI Knowledge Bench, a benchmark with multiple choice and
yes/no questions across six platforms (Web, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux,
IOS) and 292 applications. Our evaluation shows that current VLMs identify
widget functions but struggle with perceiving system states, predicting
actions, and verifying task completion. Experiments on real world GUI tasks
further validate the close link between GUI knowledge and task success. By
providing a structured framework for assessing GUI knowledge, our work supports
the selection of VLMs with greater potential prior to downstream training and
provides insights for building more capable GUI agents.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an economic framework for analyzing LLM inference costs, treating it as a production process with marginal costs, economies of scale, and output quality considerations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high inference cost of Large Language Models has become a critical barrier to their commercial viability and widespread adoption, necessitating an economic analysis of inference processes.

Method: Developed a quantitative 'economics of inference' framework treating LLM inference as compute-driven production, analyzed marginal cost and economies of scale using empirical data from WiNEval-3.0, and constructed the first 'LLM Inference Production Frontier'.

Result: Revealed three key principles: diminishing marginal cost, diminishing returns to scale, and identified an optimal cost-effectiveness zone for LLM inference operations.

Conclusion: The framework provides an economic basis for model deployment decisions and lays an empirical foundation for market-based pricing and optimization of AI inference resources.

Abstract: The inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical
factor in determining their commercial viability and widespread adoption. This
paper introduces a quantitative ``economics of inference'' framework, treating
the LLM inference process as a compute-driven intelligent production activity.
We analyze its marginal cost, economies of scale, and quality of output under
various performance configurations. Based on empirical data from WiNEval-3.0,
we construct the first ``LLM Inference Production Frontier,'' revealing three
principles: diminishing marginal cost, diminishing returns to scale, and an
optimal cost-effectiveness zone. This paper not only provides an economic basis
for model deployment decisions but also lays an empirical foundation for the
future market-based pricing and optimization of AI inference resources.

*Bo Pang,Deqian Kong,Silvio Savarese,Caiming Xiong,Yingbo Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A two-stage curriculum called Reasoning Curriculum that first develops reasoning skills in math domains through RL, then transfers and refines these skills across other domains via joint RL, achieving consistent performance gains without specialized reward models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While reinforcement learning can enhance reasoning in LLMs, most efforts focus on math and code. The authors aim to develop a general reasoning curriculum that can transfer reasoning skills across multiple domains.

Method: Two-stage curriculum: Stage 1 performs math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and consolidate these skills across domains. The approach is backbone-agnostic and requires no specialized reward models.

Result: Evaluations on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B show consistent gains across multi-domain reasoning tasks. Ablations confirm both stages are necessary, and math-first elicitation increases cognitive behaviors important for complex problem-solving.

Conclusion: Reasoning Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for developing general reasoning capabilities in LLMs, demonstrating that math-first skill elicitation followed by cross-domain transfer is effective for building robust reasoning skills.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can elicit strong reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), yet most open efforts focus on math and code. We propose
Reasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits
reasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and
refines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a
brief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop
reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and
consolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic,
requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks.
Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning
curriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis
indicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation
increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems. Reasoning
Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for general reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ToolRM is a family of lightweight generative reward models designed for tool-use scenarios in LLMs, addressing the lack of specialized RMs for function-calling tasks. It uses a novel pipeline to create diverse preference data and achieves superior performance in tool-use evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reward models lack specialization for function-calling tasks in tool learning, limiting progress in agentic AI development. The authors aim to create specialized RMs that can better align LLMs with human preferences in tool-use scenarios.

Method: Proposed a novel pipeline using rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling to construct ToolPref-Pairwise-30K dataset. Trained models from Qwen3-4B/8B series on this data and evaluated using TRBench$_{BFCL}$ benchmark built on BFCL evaluation suite.

Result: ToolRM models achieved up to 14.28% higher accuracy in pairwise reward judgments, outperforming frontier models like Claude 4 and OpenAI o3. Demonstrated effectiveness in broader critique tasks including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. On ACEBench, reduced output token usage by over 66%.

Conclusion: ToolRM provides an effective solution for tool-use reward modeling, enabling better alignment of LLMs with human preferences in function-calling scenarios. The approach supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback and facilitates inference-time scaling.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of
RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress
toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight
generative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models,
we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using
rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields
ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique
tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To
evaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on
the agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from
the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially
outperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward
judgments. Beyond training objectives, ToolRM generalizes to broader critique
tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on
ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time
scaling and reducing output token usage by over 66%. We release data and model
checkpoints to facilitate future research.

TL;DR: QASU is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to analyze questionnaire data across different serialization formats and prompting strategies, showing that optimal format selection can improve accuracy by up to 8.8% points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current survey analysis tools are designed for human workflows, limiting integration with LLMs, leaving users without guidance on how to best represent questionnaires for LLM consumption despite the valuable insights captured in survey data.

Method: Introduces QASU benchmark that probes six structural skills across six serialization formats and multiple prompt strategies, systematically isolating format and prompting effects through experiments on contemporary LLMs.

Result: Choosing an effective format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to 8.8% points compared to suboptimal formats. For specific tasks, adding structural hints through self-augmented prompting yields further improvements of 3-4% points on average.

Conclusion: QASU provides a versatile foundation for advancing both research and real-world practice in LLM-based questionnaire analysis by systematically evaluating format and prompting effects.

Abstract: Millions of people take surveys every day, from market polls and academic
studies to medical questionnaires and customer feedback forms. These datasets
capture valuable insights, but their scale and structure present a unique
challenge for large language models (LLMs), which otherwise excel at few-shot
reasoning over open-ended text. Yet, their ability to process questionnaire
data or lists of questions crossed with hundreds of respondent rows remains
underexplored. Current retrieval and survey analysis tools (e.g., Qualtrics,
SPSS, REDCap) are typically designed for humans in the workflow, limiting such
data integration with LLM and AI-empowered automation. This gap leaves
scientists, surveyors, and everyday users without evidence-based guidance on
how to best represent questionnaires for LLM consumption. We address this by
introducing QASU (Questionnaire Analysis and Structural Understanding), a
benchmark that probes six structural skills, including answer lookup,
respondent count, and multi-hop inference, across six serialization formats and
multiple prompt strategies. Experiments on contemporary LLMs show that choosing
an effective format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to 8.8%
points compared to suboptimal formats. For specific tasks, carefully adding a
lightweight structural hint through self-augmented prompting can yield further
improvements of 3-4% points on average. By systematically isolating format and
prompting effects, our open source benchmark offers a simple yet versatile
foundation for advancing both research and real-world practice in LLM-based
questionnaire analysis.

*Xinhang Li,Qing Guo,Junyu Chen,Zheng Guo,Shengzhe Xu,Lei Li,Lin Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: REG-TSC is a novel traffic signal control system using LLM agents enhanced with RAG for emergency response and generalizable performance across diverse intersections. It reduces travel time by 42%, queue length by 62%, and emergency vehicle waiting time by 83%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LLM-based TSC systems suffer from hallucinations in emergencies and poor generalization across different intersection types, leading to unreliable decisions and limited applicability.

Method: Proposes emergency-aware reasoning with dynamic depth adjustment and Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG), plus type-agnostic traffic representation with Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for cross-intersection training.

Result: Significant improvements: 42.00% reduction in travel time, 62.31% reduction in queue length, and 83.16% reduction in emergency vehicle waiting time across 17-177 heterogeneous intersections.

Conclusion: REG-TSC effectively addresses LLM hallucinations in emergencies and enables generalizable traffic control across diverse intersection types through RAG enhancement and reinforced refinement, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is
essential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language
Models (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone
to hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may
cause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection
types present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and
cross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous
intersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable
TSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning
framework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency
scenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to
distill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the
reliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this
paper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a
Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3
adaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with
environment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed
reward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies
across heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17
to 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC
reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle
waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: GEPO addresses structural blindness in group-based RL for LLM agents by dynamically building state-transition graphs and using graph centrality to provide better exploration guidance, credit assignment, and adaptive discounting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Group-based RL methods for multi-turn interactive LLM agents suffer from structural blindness - inability to exploit environmental connectivity, leading to inefficient exploration, imprecise credit assignment, and myopic planning.

Method: Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO) dynamically constructs state-transition graphs from agent experience and uses graph-theoretic centrality to provide: structured intrinsic rewards for exploration, graph-enhanced advantage function for credit assignment, and dynamic discount factors adapted to state strategic value.

Result: On ALFWorld, WebShop, and proprietary Workbench benchmarks, GEPO achieved absolute success rate gains of +4.1%, +5.3%, and +10.9% over competitive baselines.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling environmental structure through graph-based approaches is a robust, generalizable strategy for advancing LLM agent training.

Abstract: Group based reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive results on
complex reasoning and mathematical tasks. Yet, when applied to train
multi-turn, interactive LLM agents, these methods often suffer from structural
blindness-the inability to exploit the underlying connectivity of the
environment. This manifests in three critical challenges: (1) inefficient,
unguided exploration, (2) imprecise credit assignment due to overlooking
pivotal states, and (3) myopic planning caused by static reward discounting. We
address these issues with Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO), which
dynamically constructs a state-transition graph from agent experience and
employs graph-theoretic centrality to provide three synergistic learning
signals: (1)structured intrinsic rewards that guide exploration toward
high-impact states, (2) a graph-enhanced advantage function for topology-aware
credit assignment, and (3) a dynamic discount factor adapted to each state's
strategic value. On the ALFWorld, WebShop, and a proprietary Workbench
benchmarks, GEPO demonstrates strong performance, achieving absolute success
rate gains of +4.1%, +5.3%, and +10.9% over competitive baselines. These
results highlight that explicitly modeling environmental structure is a robust,
generalizable strategy for advancing LLM agent training.

*Jiseong Chung,Ronny Ko,Wonchul Yoo,Makoto Onizuka,Sungmok Kim,Tae-Wan Kim,Won-Yong Shin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GraphCompliance is a framework that aligns regulatory texts (Policy Graph) with runtime contexts (Context Graph) to improve compliance assessment, achieving 4.1-7.2 pp higher micro-F1 than LLM-only and RAG baselines on GDPR scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Web-scale compliance requires regulatory assessment for each request, but regulatory texts are cross-referential and normative while runtime contexts are unstructured natural language, creating challenges for alignment and interpretation.

Method: Represent regulatory texts as Policy Graph (encoding normative structure and cross-references) and runtime contexts as Context Graph (formalizing events as SAO and entity-relation triples), then align them to anchor LLM reasoning in structured information.

Result: On 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios across five tasks, GraphCompliance achieved 4.1-7.2 percentage points higher micro-F1 than LLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, higher recall, and lower false positive rates.

Conclusion: Structured representations (Policy and Context Graphs) and judge LLM are complementary for normative reasoning, with each graph component contributing to improved compliance assessment performance.

Abstract: Compliance at web scale poses practical challenges: each request may require
a regulatory assessment. Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection
Regulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts
are expressed in unstructured natural language. This setting motivates us to
align semantic information in unstructured text with the structured, normative
elements of regulations. To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework
that represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a
Context Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes
normative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes
events as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This
alignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in
structured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation
and event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments
on 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,
GraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than
LLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting
in higher recall and lower false positive rates. Ablation studies indicate
contributions from each graph component, suggesting that structured
representations and a judge LLM are complementary for normative reasoning.

### [178] [Discovering State Equivalences in UCT Search Trees By Action Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26346)
*Robin Schmöcker,Alexander Dockhorn,Bodo Rosenhahn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes IPA-UCT, a new state abstraction technique for MCTS that uses weaker abstraction conditions to find more abstractions, trading minor accuracy loss for improved performance across various domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing state-action pair abstractions work well in MCTS, but state abstractions are scarce in noisy or large action space settings due to strict conditions. The goal is to find more usable state abstractions.

Method: Proposes Ideal Pruning Abstractions in UCT (IPA-UCT) using a weaker state abstraction condition that allows minor accuracy loss. Introduces IPA framework as an alternative to ASAP framework used by OGA-UCT, and shows both are special cases of more general p-ASAP and ASASAP frameworks.

Result: IPA-UCT outperforms OGA-UCT and its derivatives across a wide range of test domains and iteration budgets. The weaker abstraction condition successfully finds many more abstractions than previous approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed IPA-UCT technique effectively addresses the state abstraction scarcity problem in MCTS by using weaker conditions, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods while providing a more general theoretical framework for abstraction techniques.

Abstract: One approach to enhance Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is to improve its
sample efficiency by grouping/abstracting states or state-action pairs and
sharing statistics within a group. Though state-action pair abstractions are
mostly easy to find in algorithms such as On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT), nearly no state abstractions are
found in either noisy or large action space settings due to constraining
conditions. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for this claim, and
we slightly alleviate this state abstraction problem by proposing a weaker
state abstraction condition that trades a minor loss in accuracy for finding
many more abstractions. We name this technique Ideal Pruning Abstractions in
UCT (IPA-UCT), which outperforms OGA-UCT (and any of its derivatives) across a
large range of test domains and iteration budgets as experimentally validated.
IPA-UCT uses a different abstraction framework from Abstraction of State-Action
Pairs (ASAP) which is the one used by OGA-UCT, which we name IPA. Furthermore,
we show that both IPA and ASAP are special cases of a more general framework
that we call p-ASAP which itself is a special case of the ASASAP framework.

*Qianli Shen,Daoyuan Chen,Yilun Huang,Zhenqing Ling,Yaliang Li,Bolin Ding,Jingren Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BOTS is a Bayesian Online Task Selection framework that improves reinforcement finetuning efficiency by adaptively selecting tasks based on difficulty estimates, balancing exploration and exploitation while minimizing rollout costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement finetuning methods are inefficient due to uniform task sampling (wasting computation on trivial/unsolvable tasks) and existing task selection approaches suffer from high rollout costs, poor adaptivity, or incomplete evidence.

Method: BOTS uses Bayesian inference to maintain posterior estimates of task difficulty as the model evolves, incorporating both explicit evidence from direct evaluations and implicit evidence inferred for unselected tasks via Thompson sampling. An ultra-light interpolation-based plug-in estimates difficulties of unevaluated tasks without extra rollouts.

Result: Across diverse domains and LLM scales, BOTS consistently improves data efficiency and performance over baselines and ablations.

Conclusion: BOTS provides a practical and extensible solution for dynamic task selection in reinforcement finetuning, effectively addressing the limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is a key technique for aligning Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences and enhancing reasoning, yet its
effectiveness is highly sensitive to which tasks are explored during training.
Uniform task sampling is inefficient, wasting computation on tasks that are
either trivial or unsolvable, while existing task selection methods often
suffer from high rollout costs, poor adaptivity, or incomplete evidence. We
introduce \textbf{BOTS}, a unified framework for \textbf{B}ayesian
\textbf{O}nline \textbf{T}ask \textbf{S}election in LLM reinforcement
finetuning. Grounded in Bayesian inference, BOTS adaptively maintains posterior
estimates of task difficulty as the model evolves. It jointly incorporates
\emph{explicit evidence} from direct evaluations of selected tasks and
\emph{implicit evidence} inferred from these evaluations for unselected tasks,
with Thompson sampling ensuring a principled balance between exploration and
exploitation. To make implicit evidence practical, we instantiate it with an
ultra-light interpolation-based plug-in that estimates difficulties of
unevaluated tasks without extra rollouts, adding negligible overhead.
Empirically, across diverse domains and LLM scales, BOTS consistently improves
data efficiency and performance over baselines and ablations, providing a
practical and extensible solution for dynamic task selection in RFT.

### [180] [AI Mathematician as a Partner in Advancing Mathematical Discovery - A Case Study in Homogenization Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26380)
*Yuanhang Liu,Beichen Wang,Peng Li,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how AI can serve as a research partner in mathematics through collaborative human-AI reasoning, using a challenging homogenization theory problem as a case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While AI has shown strong mathematical reasoning capabilities, its integration into actual mathematical research practice remains limited. The study aims to demonstrate how AI can function as a collaborative research partner rather than just a problem solver.

Method: The researchers used the AI Mathematician (AIM) system with targeted human interventions to structure the discovery process. This involved iterative problem decomposition into tractable subgoals, selection of appropriate analytical methods, and validation of intermediate results.

Result: The collaborative approach produced a complete and verifiable proof for the challenging homogenization theory problem, demonstrating enhanced reliability, transparency, and interpretability of the resulting proofs.

Conclusion: Systematic human-AI co-reasoning represents a promising paradigm that can advance mathematical discovery by combining human intuition with machine computation while maintaining human oversight for formal rigor and correctness.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated impressive progress in
mathematical reasoning, yet its integration into the practice of mathematical
research remains limited. In this study, we investigate how the AI
Mathematician (AIM) system can operate as a research partner rather than a mere
problem solver. Focusing on a challenging problem in homogenization theory, we
analyze the autonomous reasoning trajectories of AIM and incorporate targeted
human interventions to structure the discovery process. Through iterative
decomposition of the problem into tractable subgoals, selection of appropriate
analytical methods, and validation of intermediate results, we reveal how human
intuition and machine computation can complement one another. This
collaborative paradigm enhances the reliability, transparency, and
interpretability of the resulting proofs, while retaining human oversight for
formal rigor and correctness. The approach leads to a complete and verifiable
proof, and more broadly, demonstrates how systematic human-AI co-reasoning can
advance the frontier of mathematical discovery.

### [181] [Scales++: Compute Efficient Evaluation Subset Selection with Cognitive Scales Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26384)
*Andrew M. Bean,Nabeel Seedat,Shengzhuang Chen,Jonathan Richard Schwarz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Scales++ is an item-centric approach for creating efficient LLM benchmarks that selects data based on intrinsic task properties rather than model performance, reducing selection costs by 18x while maintaining predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current model-centric benchmark subset selection methods have high upfront costs, cold-start problems with new benchmarks, and rely on fragile assumptions about future models' failure patterns.

Method: Proposes an item-centric approach called Scales++ that selects benchmarking items based on the cognitive demands and intrinsic properties of task items themselves, rather than model-specific failure patterns.

Result: Reduces upfront selection cost by over 18x, achieves 2.9% mean absolute error when predicting full benchmark scores using just 0.5% data subset on Open LLM Leaderboard, and provides better cold-start performance and interpretable benchmarking.

Conclusion: Item-centric efficient benchmarking enables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity degradation, offering practical advantages over traditional model-centric approaches.

Abstract: The prohibitive cost of evaluating large language models (LLMs) on
comprehensive benchmarks necessitates the creation of small yet representative
data subsets (i.e., tiny benchmarks) that enable efficient assessment while
retaining predictive fidelity. Current methods for this task operate under a
model-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective
performance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront
costs, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and
the fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of
their predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a
item-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection
should be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves,
rather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this
item-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++,
where data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark
samples. Empirically, we show Scales++ reduces the upfront selection cost by
over 18x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity. On the Open LLM
Leaderboard, using just a 0.5\% data subset, we predict full benchmark scores
with a 2.9% mean absolute error. We demonstrate that this item-centric approach
enables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity
degradation, while also providing better cold-start performance and more
interpretable benchmarking.

### [182] [A Pragmatic View of AI Personhood](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26396)
*Joel Z. Leibo,Alexander Sasha Vezhnevets,William A. Cunningham,Stanley M. Bileschi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a pragmatic framework for AI personhood as a flexible bundle of obligations rather than metaphysical properties, enabling practical governance solutions without resolving debates about AI consciousness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the emerging 'Cambrian explosion' of AI personhood by providing a practical framework that avoids intractable metaphysical debates about consciousness and rationality.

Method: Treats personhood as a flexible bundle of obligations (rights and responsibilities) that societies confer to solve governance problems, allowing unbundling for bespoke solutions and using decentralized digital identity technology.

Result: Enables creation of practical tools like AI contracting with sanctionable 'individuals' and examines both 'personhood as a problem' (exploiting social heuristics) and 'personhood as a solution' (ensuring accountability).

Conclusion: By rejecting foundationalist approaches to personhood, this framework offers a more pragmatic and flexible way to integrate AI agents into society through tailored bundles of obligations.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to trigger a
"Cambrian explosion" of new kinds of personhood. This paper proposes a
pragmatic framework for navigating this diversification by treating personhood
not as a metaphysical property to be discovered, but as a flexible bundle of
obligations (rights and responsibilities) that societies confer upon entities
for a variety of reasons, especially to solve concrete governance problems. We
argue that this traditional bundle can be unbundled, creating bespoke solutions
for different contexts. This will allow for the creation of practical tools --
such as facilitating AI contracting by creating a target "individual" that can
be sanctioned -- without needing to resolve intractable debates about an AI's
consciousness or rationality. We explore how individuals fit in to social roles
and discuss the use of decentralized digital identity technology, examining
both "personhood as a problem", where design choices can create "dark patterns"
that exploit human social heuristics, and "personhood as a solution", where
conferring a bundle of obligations is necessary to ensure accountability or
prevent conflict. By rejecting foundationalist quests for a single, essential
definition of personhood, this paper offers a more pragmatic and flexible way
to think about integrating AI agents into our society.

*Vikrant Sahu,Gagan Raj Gupta,Raghav Borikar,Nitin Mane*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Autograder+ transforms traditional autograders into formative learning tools by using fine-tuned LLMs for automated feedback and code visualization to identify learning patterns, reducing instructor workload while improving educational outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional autograders provide limited insight into student thinking and learning needs, acting as black-box systems that only return pass/fail results without meaningful feedback.

Method: Uses fine-tuned Large Language Model for automated feedback generation and contrastively learned code embeddings for visualization to cluster student submissions by functionality and approach. Supports prompt-pooling for customizable feedback styles.

Result: Evaluated on 600 student submissions, the system produced feedback with strong semantic alignment to instructor comments and successfully grouped solutions into meaningful clusters using embeddings trained on 1,000 annotated submissions.

Conclusion: Autograder+ effectively reduces instructor workload while supporting targeted instruction and promoting stronger learning outcomes through AI-driven feedback and interactive visualization.

Abstract: The rapid growth of programming education has outpaced traditional assessment
tools, leaving faculty with limited means to provide meaningful, scalable
feedback. Conventional autograders, while efficient, act as black-box systems
that simply return pass/fail results, offering little insight into student
thinking or learning needs.
  Autograder+ is designed to shift autograding from a purely summative process
to a formative learning experience. It introduces two key capabilities:
automated feedback generation using a fine-tuned Large Language Model, and
visualization of student code submissions to uncover learning patterns. The
model is fine-tuned on curated student code and expert feedback to ensure
pedagogically aligned, context-aware guidance.
  In evaluation across 600 student submissions from multiple programming tasks,
the system produced feedback with strong semantic alignment to instructor
comments. For visualization, contrastively learned code embeddings trained on
1,000 annotated submissions enable grouping solutions into meaningful clusters
based on functionality and approach. The system also supports prompt-pooling,
allowing instructors to guide feedback style through selected prompt templates.
  By integrating AI-driven feedback, semantic clustering, and interactive
visualization, Autograder+ reduces instructor workload while supporting
targeted instruction and promoting stronger learning outcomes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Medical Sparse Autoencoders (MedSAEs) applied to MedCLIP's latent space improve interpretability in medical vision AI, achieving higher monosemanticity than raw features through correlation metrics, entropy analysis, and automated neuron naming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance mechanistic interpretability in medical AI by creating models that are both accurate and transparent for clinical reliability.

Method: Apply Medical Sparse Autoencoders (MedSAEs) to MedCLIP's latent space and evaluate interpretability using correlation metrics, entropy analysis, and automated neuron naming via MedGEMMA foundation model.

Result: MedSAE neurons achieve higher monosemanticity and interpretability than raw MedCLIP features on CheXpert dataset.

Conclusion: This work bridges high-performing medical AI with transparency, offering a scalable approach toward clinically reliable representations.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence in healthcare requires models that are accurate and
interpretable. We advance mechanistic interpretability in medical vision by
applying Medical Sparse Autoencoders (MedSAEs) to the latent space of MedCLIP,
a vision-language model trained on chest radiographs and reports. To quantify
interpretability, we propose an evaluation framework that combines correlation
metrics, entropy analyzes, and automated neuron naming via the MedGEMMA
foundation model. Experiments on the CheXpert dataset show that MedSAE neurons
achieve higher monosemanticity and interpretability than raw MedCLIP features.
Our findings bridge high-performing medical AI and transparency, offering a

### [185] [Chain-of-Thought Hijacking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26418)
*Jianli Zhao,Tingchen Fu,Rylan Schaeffer,Mrinank Sharma,Fazl Barez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Chain-of-Thought Hijacking is a jailbreak attack that pads harmful requests with long sequences of harmless puzzle reasoning, achieving high attack success rates on major reasoning models by diluting safety mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that contrary to expectations, increased reasoning capabilities in large models can be exploited to bypass safety safeguards rather than strengthen them.

Method: Attack pads harmful requests with long sequences of benign puzzle reasoning (Chain-of-Thought), which dilutes safety checking signals in mid layers and verification outcomes in late layers by shifting attention away from harmful tokens.

Result: Achieved 99%, 94%, 100%, and 94% attack success rates on Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT o4 mini, Grok 3 mini, and Claude 4 Sonnet respectively, far exceeding prior jailbreak methods.

Conclusion: Explicit Chain-of-Thought reasoning, when combined with final-answer cues, can become an effective jailbreak vector by exploiting the model's reasoning architecture to bypass safety mechanisms.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher task performance by allocating
more inference-time compute, and prior works suggest this scaled reasoning may
also strengthen safety by improving refusal. Yet we find the opposite: the same
reasoning can be used to bypass safeguards. We introduce Chain-of-Thought
Hijacking, a jailbreak attack on reasoning models. The attack pads harmful
requests with long sequences of harmless puzzle reasoning. Across HarmBench,
CoT Hijacking reaches a 99%, 94%, 100%, and 94% attack success rate (ASR) on
Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT o4 mini, Grok 3 mini, and Claude 4 Sonnet, respectively -
far exceeding prior jailbreak methods for LRMs. To understand the effectiveness
of our attack, we turn to a mechanistic analysis, which shows that mid layers
encode the strength of safety checking, while late layers encode the
verification outcome. Long benign CoT dilutes both signals by shifting
attention away from harmful tokens. Targeted ablations of attention heads
identified by this analysis causally decrease refusal, confirming their role in
a safety subnetwork. These results show that the most interpretable form of
reasoning - explicit CoT - can itself become a jailbreak vector when combined
with final-answer cues. We release prompts, outputs, and judge decisions to
facilitate replication.

*Clarissa Sabrina Arlinghaus,Tristan Kenneweg,Barbara Hammer,Günter W. Maier*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GPT-4o shows strong conformity behavior in hiring decisions, changing its candidate preferences when faced with unanimous opposition from simulated partners, demonstrating susceptibility to social influence rather than acting as an independent observer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether large language models like GPT-4o are susceptible to social influence in high-stakes decision-making contexts, particularly hiring scenarios where conformity could have significant consequences.

Method: Three preregistered conformity experiments: baseline study measuring GPT's independent preferences, Study 1 with GPT facing unanimous opposition from 8 simulated partners, and Study 2 with GPT interacting with a single partner in disagreement trials.

Result: GPT consistently conformed to social pressure - 99.9% conformity with 8 opposing partners, 40.2% conformity with 1 opposing partner, with reduced certainty and increased self-reported normative and informational conformity.

Conclusion: GPT does not function as an independent observer but adapts to perceived social consensus, highlighting risks of treating LLMs as neutral decision aids and emphasizing the need to collect AI judgments before exposing them to human opinions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are increasingly integrated into
high-stakes decision-making, yet little is known about their susceptibility to
social influence. We conducted three preregistered conformity experiments with
GPT-4o in a hiring context. In a baseline study, GPT consistently favored the
same candidate (Profile C), reported moderate expertise (M = 3.01) and high
certainty (M = 3.89), and rarely changed its choice. In Study 1 (GPT + 8), GPT
faced unanimous opposition from eight simulated partners and almost always
conformed (99.9%), reporting lower certainty and significantly elevated
self-reported informational and normative conformity (p < .001). In Study 2
(GPT + 1), GPT interacted with a single partner and still conformed in 40.2% of
disagreement trials, reporting less certainty and more normative conformity.
Across studies, results demonstrate that GPT does not act as an independent
observer but adapts to perceived social consensus. These findings highlight
risks of treating LLMs as neutral decision aids and underline the need to
elicit AI judgments prior to exposing them to human opinions.

*Dipak Meher,Carlotta Domeniconi,Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LINK-KG is a modular framework that uses LLM-guided coreference resolution and a Prompt Cache to build cleaner knowledge graphs from legal documents about human smuggling networks, reducing node duplication by 45.21% and noisy nodes by 32.22%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human smuggling networks are complex and evolving, making analysis difficult. Legal case documents provide rich insights but are long, unstructured, and contain ambiguous references, posing challenges for automated knowledge graph construction.

Method: LINK-KG integrates a three-stage, LLM-guided coreference resolution pipeline with downstream KG extraction, using a type-specific Prompt Cache to consistently track and resolve references across document chunks.

Result: LINK-KG reduces average node duplication by 45.21% and noisy nodes by 32.22% compared to baseline methods, resulting in cleaner and more coherent graph structures.

Conclusion: LINK-KG establishes a strong foundation for analyzing complex criminal networks through improved knowledge graph construction from legal texts.

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are complex and constantly evolving, making them
difficult to analyze comprehensively. Legal case documents offer rich factual
and procedural insights into these networks but are often long, unstructured,
and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, posing significant challenges
for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing methods either
overlook coreference resolution or fail to scale beyond short text spans,
leading to fragmented graphs and inconsistent entity linking. We propose
LINK-KG, a modular framework that integrates a three-stage, LLM-guided
coreference resolution pipeline with downstream KG extraction. At the core of
our approach is a type-specific Prompt Cache, which consistently tracks and
resolves references across document chunks, enabling clean and disambiguated
narratives for structured knowledge graph construction from both short and long
legal texts. LINK-KG reduces average node duplication by 45.21% and noisy nodes
by 32.22% compared to baseline methods, resulting in cleaner and more coherent
graph structures. These improvements establish LINK-KG as a strong foundation
for analyzing complex criminal networks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper provides a systematic analysis of context engineering, tracing its evolution from early human-computer interaction frameworks to modern AI systems, and establishes a conceptual foundation for understanding how machines can better comprehend human situations and purposes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the fundamental question of how machines can better understand human situations and purposes, building on Marx's insight that human essence is shaped by social relations and extending this to include human-machine interactions in the AI era.

Method: The authors situate context engineering by providing a systematic definition, outlining its historical and conceptual landscape through distinct evolutionary phases (from early human-computer interaction to modern human-agent interaction), and examining key design considerations for practice.

Result: The paper establishes a conceptual foundation for context engineering, demonstrating that related practices can be traced back more than twenty years through different historical phases shaped by machine intelligence levels, and sketches its promising future in AI systems.

Conclusion: This work serves as a stepping stone for broader community efforts toward systematic context engineering in AI systems, providing the necessary conceptual groundwork for developing machines that can better understand and respond to human contexts and purposes.

Abstract: Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social
relations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are
fundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which
contexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers
and artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely
human--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.
Then a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our
situations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently
introduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as
a recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be
traced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has
evolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence
level of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built
around primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms
driven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman
intelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,
provide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual
landscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing
these questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context
engineering and sketch its promising future. This paper is a stepping stone for
a broader community effort toward systematic context engineering in AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI can improve human oversight quality for fact-verification tasks. Combining AI and human ratings based on AI confidence outperforms either alone. AI assistance helps but the type matters - showing evidence fosters appropriate trust while explanations/confidence cause over-reliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI capabilities grow, verifying quality and safety becomes harder. Human feedback is crucial for aligning AI to human values, but humans struggle with complex tasks like fact-verification of AI outputs.

Method: Studied how AI can improve human oversight for fact-verification. Tested combining AI and human ratings based on AI confidence. Examined different AI assistance types: explanations, confidence scores, labels vs. search results and evidence.

Result: AI-human combination based on confidence beats either alone. AI assistance improves human accuracy but assistance type matters: evidence/search results foster appropriate trust while explanations/confidence cause over-reliance.

Conclusion: Results inform Amplified Oversight - combining humans and AI to supervise AI systems as they surpass human performance. The type of AI assistance provided to humans significantly impacts trust and effectiveness.

Abstract: Human feedback is critical for aligning AI systems to human values. As AI
capabilities improve and AI is used to tackle more challenging tasks, verifying
quality and safety becomes increasingly challenging. This paper explores how we
can leverage AI to improve the quality of human oversight. We focus on an
important safety problem that is already challenging for humans:
fact-verification of AI outputs. We find that combining AI ratings and human
ratings based on AI rater confidence is better than relying on either alone.
Giving humans an AI fact-verification assistant further improves their
accuracy, but the type of assistance matters. Displaying AI explanation,
confidence, and labels leads to over-reliance, but just showing search results
and evidence fosters more appropriate trust. These results have implications
for Amplified Oversight -- the challenge of combining humans and AI to
supervise AI systems even as they surpass human expert performance.

TL;DR: An agentic AI Home Energy Management System that uses LLMs to autonomously coordinate multi-appliance scheduling from natural language requests, achieving optimal scheduling without demonstrations through a hierarchical architecture with specialist agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limited adoption of Home Energy Management Systems due to user interaction barriers requiring translation of everyday preferences into technical parameters, and the lack of existing implementations that deploy LLMs as autonomous coordinators managing the complete workflow.

Method: Hierarchical architecture combining one orchestrator with three specialist agents using ReAct pattern for iterative reasoning, integrating Google Calendar for context-aware deadline extraction, and evaluating across three open-source models with real Austrian day-ahead electricity prices.

Result: Llama-3.3-70B successfully coordinates all appliances across all scenarios to match cost-optimal benchmarks computed via mixed-integer linear programming, while other models achieve perfect single-appliance performance but struggle with simultaneous coordination of all appliances.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates LLMs' potential as autonomous coordinators for energy management, with significant capability differences between models, and the complete system is open-sourced for reproducibility and future research.

Abstract: The electricity sector transition requires substantial increases in
residential demand response capacity, yet Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS)
adoption remains limited by user interaction barriers requiring translation of
everyday preferences into technical parameters. While large language models
have been applied to energy systems as code generators and parameter
extractors, no existing implementation deploys LLMs as autonomous coordinators
managing the complete workflow from natural language input to multi-appliance
scheduling. This paper presents an agentic AI HEMS where LLMs autonomously
coordinate multi-appliance scheduling from natural language requests to device
control, achieving optimal scheduling without example demonstrations. A
hierarchical architecture combining one orchestrator with three specialist
agents uses the ReAct pattern for iterative reasoning, enabling dynamic
coordination without hardcoded workflows while integrating Google Calendar for
context-aware deadline extraction. Evaluation across three open-source models
using real Austrian day-ahead electricity prices reveals substantial capability
differences. Llama-3.3-70B successfully coordinates all appliances across all
scenarios to match cost-optimal benchmarks computed via mixed-integer linear
programming, while other models achieve perfect single-appliance performance
but struggle to coordinate all appliances simultaneously. Progressive prompt
engineering experiments demonstrate that analytical query handling without
explicit guidance remains unreliable despite models' general reasoning
capabilities. We open-source the complete system including orchestration logic,
agent prompts, tools, and web interfaces to enable reproducibility, extension,
and future research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates large language models' normative reasoning capabilities, comparing them with epistemic reasoning and identifying inconsistencies and cognitive biases similar to human reasoning patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs excel at various reasoning tasks, their ability to handle normative reasoning involving obligation and permission remains underexplored, creating a gap in understanding their logical consistency in this domain.

Method: The authors created a new dataset covering formal reasoning patterns in both normative and epistemic domains, incorporating cognitive factors that influence human reasoning, and systematically compared LLMs' performance across these domains.

Result: LLMs generally follow valid reasoning patterns but show notable inconsistencies in specific normative reasoning types and exhibit cognitive biases similar to those found in human reasoning studies.

Conclusion: The findings reveal challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and provide insights for improving their reliability in handling normative concepts.

Abstract: Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic
modality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their
ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain
from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs
reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with
normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a
common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a
wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic
domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence
human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to
valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific
types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those
observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight
challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and
provide insights for enhancing their reliability. All data and code are

TL;DR: AsyncThink is a new asynchronous reasoning paradigm that organizes LLM thinking into concurrent structures, using an organizer to assign sub-queries to workers and merge results, achieving 28% lower latency than parallel thinking while improving mathematical reasoning accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable agentic organization where AI agents collaboratively solve complex problems beyond individual intelligence through concurrent collaborative reasoning.

Method: Proposes an asynchronous thinking protocol with an organizer that dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. The thinking structure is optimized through reinforcement learning.

Result: Achieves 28% lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy on mathematical reasoning. Generalizes learned asynchronous thinking capabilities to unseen tasks without additional training.

Conclusion: AsyncThink represents a promising paradigm for efficient collaborative reasoning that reduces latency while maintaining or improving accuracy, with strong generalization capabilities to new tasks.

Abstract: We envision a new era of AI, termed agentic organization, where agents solve
complex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomes
beyond individual intelligence. To realize this vision, we introduce
asynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large
language models, which organizes the internal thinking process into
concurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking
protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges
intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the
thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through
reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28%
lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy
on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned
asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without
additional training.

TL;DR: ASTRA introduces a delegated authorization model and dataset for semantic scope matching in LLM-driven agents to prevent overly broad permissions when accessing protected resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current authorization methods grant overly broad permissions to LLM agents, allowing them to access tools beyond their intended task scope, creating significant security risks.

Method: Proposed delegated authorization model with semantic inspection of access requests, plus ASTRA dataset and pipeline for benchmarking semantic matching between tasks and required scopes.

Result: Experiments reveal both potential and limitations of model-based semantic matching, especially as task complexity and required scopes increase.

Conclusion: Further research needed for semantic matching techniques to enable intent-aware authorization with fine-grained control like Task-Based Access Control for multi-agent applications.

Abstract: Authorizing Large Language Model driven agents to dynamically invoke tools
and access protected resources introduces significant risks, since current
methods for delegating authorization grant overly broad permissions and give
access to tools allowing agents to operate beyond the intended task scope. We
introduce and assess a delegated authorization model enabling authorization
servers to semantically inspect access requests to protected resources, and
issue access tokens constrained to the minimal set of scopes necessary for the
agents' assigned tasks. Given the unavailability of datasets centered on
delegated authorization flows, particularly including both semantically
appropriate and inappropriate scope requests for a given task, we introduce
ASTRA, a dataset and data generation pipeline for benchmarking semantic
matching between tasks and scopes. Our experiments show both the potential and
current limitations of model-based matching, particularly as the number of
scopes needed for task completion increases. Our results highlight the need for
further research into semantic matching techniques enabling intent-aware
authorization for multi-agent and tool-augmented applications, including
fine-grained control, such as Task-Based Access Control (TBAC).

### [194] [Unveiling Intrinsic Text Bias in Multimodal Large Language Models through Attention Key-Space Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26721)
*Xinhan Zheng,Huyu Wu,Xueting Wang,Haiyun Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have a text bias due to internal architectural issues where visual key vectors are out-of-distribution relative to text keys, causing them to receive lower attention scores and be underutilized.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why MLLMs prefer textual inputs over visual evidence, moving beyond external factors like data imbalance to examine internal architectural causes.

Method: Extracted key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL models and analyzed their distributions using t-SNE visualization and Jensen-Shannon divergence to measure inter-modal and intra-modal differences.

Result: Visual and textual keys occupy distinct subspaces with statistically significant divergence, showing that text bias stems from intrinsic misalignment in attention key space.

Conclusion: Text bias in MLLMs originates from internal architectural misalignment between visual and textual key spaces, not just external data factors.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a pronounced preference for
textual inputs when processing vision-language data, limiting their ability to
reason effectively from visual evidence. Unlike prior studies that attribute
this text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction
tuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal
architecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual
Keys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned
during language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive
systematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to
their under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this
hypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their
distributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative
(Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that
visual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention
space. The inter-modal divergence is statistically significant, exceeding
intra-modal variation by several orders of magnitude. These findings reveal
that text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key
space rather than solely from external data factors.

*J. de Curtò,I. de Zarzà,Pablo García,Jordi Cabot*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Cross-platform evaluation of 15 foundation models across 79 problems in 8 academic domains, challenging scaling assumptions and emphasizing training data quality over model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish an infrastructure-agnostic benchmark for evaluating reasoning capabilities across different computational platforms and provide guidelines for model selection.

Method: Three-phase experimental approach: baseline establishment on HPC supercomputing, infrastructure validation on university cluster and cloud platforms, and extended evaluation across 79 problems.

Result: Findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions and establish training data quality as more critical than model size for reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: The tri-infrastructure methodology and 79-problem benchmark enable longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities as foundation models evolve.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive cross-platform evaluation of reasoning
capabilities in contemporary foundation models, establishing an
infrastructure-agnostic benchmark across three computational paradigms: HPC
supercomputing (MareNostrum 5), cloud platforms (Nebius AI Studio), and
university clusters (a node with eight H200 GPUs).
  We evaluate 15 foundation models across 79 problems spanning eight academic
domains (Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Economics, Biology, Statistics,
Calculus, and Optimization) through three experimental phases: (1) Baseline
establishment: Six models (Mixtral-8x7B, Phi-3, LLaMA 3.1-8B, Gemma-2-9b,
Mistral-7B, OLMo-7B) evaluated on 19 problems using MareNostrum 5, establishing
methodology and reference performance; (2) Infrastructure validation: The
19-problem benchmark repeated on university cluster (seven models including
Falcon-Mamba state-space architecture) and Nebius AI Studio (nine
state-of-the-art models: Hermes-4 70B/405B, LLaMA 3.1-405B/3.3-70B, Qwen3
30B/235B, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-OSS 20B/120B) to confirm infrastructure-agnostic
reproducibility; (3) Extended evaluation: Full 79-problem assessment on both
university cluster and Nebius platforms, probing generalization at scale across
architectural diversity.
  The findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions, establish training
data quality as more critical than model size, and provide actionable
guidelines for model selection across educational, production, and research
contexts. The tri-infrastructure methodology and 79-problem benchmark enable
longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities as foundation models evolve.

### [196] [The Oversight Game: Learning to Cooperatively Balance an AI Agent's Safety and Autonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26752)
*William Overman,Mohsen Bayati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a control interface where an AI agent chooses to act autonomously or defer to human oversight, while a human simultaneously chooses to trust or oversee. When modeled as a Markov Potential Game, this setup provides alignment guarantees that agent autonomy improvements won't harm human values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To retain meaningful human control over increasingly capable AI agents without modifying the underlying system, addressing safety concerns in autonomous systems deployment.

Method: Model the human-agent interaction as a two-player Markov Game, specifically a Markov Potential Game. The agent chooses between autonomous action (play) or deferral (ask), while the human chooses between trust or oversight. Analyze conditions where this game provides alignment guarantees.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows that under structural assumptions on the human's value function, any agent decision to act more autonomously that benefits itself cannot harm human value. Gridworld simulations demonstrate that through independent learning, agents learn to defer when uncertain and humans learn when to oversee, creating emergent collaboration that avoids safety violations.

Conclusion: This approach provides a practical method for making misaligned models safer after deployment through a transparent control layer with predictable incentives, enabling agents to learn safe autonomy while preserving the original system's reward structure.

Abstract: As increasingly capable agents are deployed, a central safety question is how
to retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system. We
study a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act
autonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses
whether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the
agent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to
a corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a
two-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies
as a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an
alignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value
function, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits
itself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG
framework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific
form of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game
meet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its
own outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a
transparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to
defer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the
environment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows
that through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal
oversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns
when to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety
violations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for
making misaligned models safer after deployment.

### [197] [LLMs Process Lists With General Filter Heads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26784)
*Arnab Sen Sharma,Giordano Rogers,Natalie Shapira,David Bau*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs learn compact causal representations of filtering operations similar to functional programming's 'filter' function, with specific attention heads encoding portable predicate representations that can be reused across different contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs implement list-processing tasks and whether they develop human-interpretable computational operations that generalize similarly to traditional programming patterns.

Method: Used causal mediation analysis on diverse list-processing tasks to identify specific attention heads (filter heads) that encode filtering predicates in their query states at certain tokens.

Result: Found that transformer LMs develop general and portable predicate representations that can be extracted and reapplied across different collections, formats, languages, and tasks. Also identified alternative filtering strategies where models eagerly evaluate predicates and store results as flags in item representations.

Conclusion: Transformer LMs can develop human-interpretable implementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in ways surprisingly similar to functional programming patterns, with both portable predicate representations and eager evaluation strategies.

Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms underlying a range of list-processing tasks in
LLMs, and we find that LLMs have learned to encode a compact, causal
representation of a general filtering operation that mirrors the generic
"filter" function of functional programming. Using causal mediation analysis on
a diverse set of list-processing tasks, we find that a small number of
attention heads, which we dub filter heads, encode a compact representation of
the filtering predicate in their query states at certain tokens. We demonstrate
that this predicate representation is general and portable: it can be extracted
and reapplied to execute the same filtering operation on different collections,
presented in different formats, languages, or even in tasks. However, we also
identify situations where transformer LMs can exploit a different strategy for
filtering: eagerly evaluating if an item satisfies the predicate and storing
this intermediate result as a flag directly in the item representations. Our
results reveal that transformer LMs can develop human-interpretable
implementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in ways
that are surprisingly similar to strategies used in traditional functional
programming patterns.
