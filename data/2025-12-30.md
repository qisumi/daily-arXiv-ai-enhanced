*Pu Zhao,Xuan Shen,Zhenglun Kong,Yixin Shen,Sung-En Chang,Arash Akbari,Timothy Rupprecht,Lei Lu,Enfu Nan,Changdi Yang,Yumei He,Weiyan Shi,Xingchen Xu,Yu Huang,Wei Jiang,Wei Wang,Yue Chen,Yong He,Yanzhi Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Moxin 7B, a fully open-source LLM with complete transparency in training, datasets, and implementation details, plus three task-specific variants (Moxin-VLM, Moxin-VLA, Moxin-Chinese), which show superior performance in evaluations; all models, data, and code are released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To foster an inclusive and collaborative open-source LLM ecosystem by addressing the lack of complete transparency in existing open-source LLMs (which often only share weights without full details on training, datasets, or implementation).

Method: Develop Moxin 7B following the Model Openness Framework (with full transparency in training, datasets, implementation); create three variants (Moxin-VLM for vision-language, Moxin-VLA for vision-language-action, Moxin-Chinese for Chinese capabilities) using open-source frameworks and open data for training.

Result: The Moxin models (including variants) achieve superior performance in various evaluations across their target tasks.

Conclusion: Moxin 7B and its variants contribute to a healthy open-source ecosystem via full transparency; releasing models, data, and code supports further collaborative research and application.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have undergone a significant transformation, marked by a rapid rise in both their popularity and capabilities. Leading this evolution are proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 and GPT-o1, which have captured widespread attention in the AI community due to their remarkable performance and versatility. Simultaneously, open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA and Mistral, have made great contributions to the ever-increasing popularity of LLMs due to the ease to customize and deploy the models across diverse applications. Moxin 7B is introduced as a fully open-source LLM developed in accordance with the Model Openness Framework, which moves beyond the simple sharing of model weights to embrace complete transparency in training, datasets, and implementation detail, thus fostering a more inclusive and collaborative research environment that can sustain a healthy open-source ecosystem. To further equip Moxin with various capabilities in different tasks, we develop three variants based on Moxin, including Moxin-VLM, Moxin-VLA, and Moxin-Chinese, which target the vision-language, vision-language-action, and Chinese capabilities, respectively. Experiments show that our models achieve superior performance in various evaluations. We adopt open-source framework and open data for the training. We release our models, along with the available data and code to derive these models.

### [2] [Hierarchical Geometry of Cognitive States in Transformer Embedding Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22227)
*Sophie Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether transformer sentence embeddings encode hierarchical cognitive structures by testing recoverability of annotated cognitive attributes via probes, finding evidence of aligned hierarchical geometric organization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if transformer-based language models' embedding spaces contain higher-level cognitive organization aligned with human-interpretable attributes, which is underexplored despite known rich geometric structure.

Method: Construct a dataset of 480 sentences annotated with continuous ordinal energy scores and discrete tier labels across seven cognitive categories; use fixed embeddings from multiple transformer models to evaluate recoverability via linear and shallow nonlinear probes; compare with lexical TF-IDF baselines; use nonparametric permutation tests, UMAP visualizations, and confusion matrices for analysis.

Result: Both continuous scores and tier labels are reliably decodable across models; shallow nonlinear probes outperform linear ones; TF-IDF baselines perform substantially worse; permutation tests confirm performance exceeds chance; UMAP shows smooth gradients and confusion matrices show adjacent-tier confusions.

Conclusion: Transformer embedding spaces exhibit hierarchical geometric organization aligned with human-defined cognitive attributes, without making claims about internal awareness or phenomenology.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that transformer-based language models learn rich geometric structure in their embedding spaces, yet the presence of higher-level cognitive organization within these representations remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate whether sentence embeddings encode a graded, hierarchical structure aligned with human-interpretable cognitive or psychological attributes. We construct a dataset of 480 natural-language sentences annotated with continuous ordinal energy scores and discrete tier labels spanning seven ordered cognitive categories. Using fixed sentence embeddings from multiple transformer models, we evaluate the recoverability of these annotations via linear and shallow nonlinear probes. Across models, both continuous scores and tier labels are reliably decodable, with shallow nonlinear probes providing consistent performance gains over linear probes. Lexical TF-IDF baselines perform substantially worse, indicating that the observed structure is not attributable to surface word statistics alone. Nonparametric permutation tests further confirm that probe performance exceeds chance under label-randomization nulls. Qualitative analyses using UMAP visualizations and confusion matrices reveal smooth low-to-high gradients and predominantly adjacent-tier confusions in embedding space. Taken together, these results provide evidence that transformer embedding spaces exhibit a hierarchical geometric organization aligned with human-defined cognitive attributes, while remaining agnostic to claims of internal awareness or phenomenology.

### [3] [SmartSnap: Proactive Evidence Seeking for Self-Verifying Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22322)
*Shaofei Cai,Yulei Qin,Haojia Lin,Zihan Xu,Gang Li,Yuchen Shi,Zongyi Li,Yong Mao,Siqi Cai,Xiaoyu Tan,Yitao Liang,Ke Li,Xing Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes SmartSnap, a proactive in-situ self-verification paradigm for agentic RL to address scalability issues in task completion verification, showing significant performance gains in mobile tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing task verification in agentic RL is passive and post-hoc, processing verbose, noisy trajectories leading to high cost and low reliability; need a scalable solution.

Method: Introduce Self-Verifying Agent with dual missions (task completion + snapshot evidence curation) guided by 3C Principles (Completeness, Conciseness, Creativity); use general LLM-as-a-Judge on minimal snapshots for verification.

Result: Experiments on mobile tasks show SmartSnap brings up to 26.08% (8B models) and16.66% (30B models) performance gains; agents compete well against DeepSeek V3.1 and Qwen3-235B-A22B.

Conclusion: SmartSnap paradigm enables scalable training of LLM-driven agents via synergizing solution finding and evidence seeking, improving performance and reliability.

Abstract: Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise for the development of autonomous agents under complex GUI tasks, but its scalability remains severely hampered by the verification of task completion. Existing task verification is treated as a passive, post-hoc process: a verifier (i.e., rule-based scoring script, reward or critic model, and LLM-as-a-Judge) analyzes the agent's entire interaction trajectory to determine if the agent succeeds. Such processing of verbose context that contains irrelevant, noisy history poses challenges to the verification protocols and therefore leads to prohibitive cost and low reliability. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose SmartSnap, a paradigm shift from this passive, post-hoc verification to proactive, in-situ self-verification by the agent itself. We introduce the Self-Verifying Agent, a new type of agent designed with dual missions: to not only complete a task but also to prove its accomplishment with curated snapshot evidences. Guided by our proposed 3C Principles (Completeness, Conciseness, and Creativity), the agent leverages its accessibility to the online environment to perform self-verification on a minimal, decisive set of snapshots. Such evidences are provided as the sole materials for a general LLM-as-a-Judge verifier to determine their validity and relevance. Experiments on mobile tasks across model families and scales demonstrate that our SmartSnap paradigm allows training LLM-driven agents in a scalable manner, bringing performance gains up to 26.08% and 16.66% respectively to 8B and 30B models. The synergizing between solution finding and evidence seeking facilitates the cultivation of efficient, self-verifying agents with competitive performance against DeepSeek V3.1 and Qwen3-235B-A22B.

### [4] [The Syntax of qulk-clauses in Yemeni Ibbi Arabic: A Minimalist Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22376)
*Zubaida Mohammed Albadani,Mohammed Q. Shormani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study analyzes qulk-clauses in Yemeni Ibbi Arabic (YIA) under the Minimalist Program, proposing they are biclausal with qulk as a clause-embedding predicate selecting a full CP complement, explaining dialect-specific features and contributing to generative syntax and minimalist universality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the syntax of qulk-clauses in YIA, which introduce embedded declarative, interrogative, and imperative clauses often without a complementizer, and to understand their structure and derivation within the Minimalist Program.

Method: Applying core minimalist operations (Merge, Move, Agree, Spell-out) and post-syntactic processes (Morphological Merger) to provide a layered syntactic analysis of qulk-clauses.

Result: The proposal accounts for dialect-specific features of YIA qulk-clauses, such as bipartite negation, cliticization, and CP embedding, and offers theoretical contributions to generative syntax (specifically minimalism).

Conclusion: The study raises questions about extending the analysis to the addressee-clause kil-k ('you said') and provides insights into the possibility of the universality of minimalism.

Abstract: This study investigates the syntax of qulk-clauses in Yemeni Ibbi Arabic (YIA) within the Minimalist Program. The construction qulk-clause, a morphologically fused form meaning 'I said,' introduces embedded declarative interrogative, and imperative clauses, often eithout complementizer. The central proposal of this paper is that qulk-clauses are biclausal structures in which qulk functions a clause-embedding predicate sec;ecting a dull CP complement. By applying core minimalist operations, viz., Merge, Move, Agree, and Spell-out, the study provides a layered syntactic analysis of qulk-clauses, for illustrating how their derivation proceeds through standard computational steps and post-syntactic processes such as Morphological Merger. The proposal also accounts for dialect-specific features like bipartite negation, cliticization, and CP embedding. The findings offer theoretical contributions to generative syntax, specifically minimalism. The study concludes raising theoretical questions concerning extending the analysis to the addressee-clause kil-k 'you said'. It also provides insights into the possibility of the universality of minimalism.

### [5] [Towards Efficient Post-Training via Fourier-Driven Adapter Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22378)
*Donggyun Bae,Jongil Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel framework called Fourier-Activated Adapter (FAA) is proposed for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large pre-trained language models, which incorporates random Fourier features into lightweight adapters to decompose representations into low- and high-frequency components for frequency-aware modulation, achieving competitive performance with low overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large pre-trained language models while allowing frequency-aware modulation of semantic information to enhance adaptation performance without high computational or memory costs.

Method: Propose the Fourier-Activated Adapter (FAA) framework: integrate random Fourier features into lightweight adapter modules to decompose intermediate representations into complementary low- and high-frequency components, enabling frequency-aware modulation of semantic information while keeping the backbone frozen.

Result: Extensive experiments on GLUE, E2E NLG, and instruction-tuning benchmarks show FAA consistently achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, with low computational and memory overhead.

Conclusion: FAA is a robust and efficient approach for post-training large language models, with effective frequency-aware activation and adaptive weighting mechanisms verified by ablation studies.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework, termed Fourier-Activated Adapter (FAA), for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large pre-trained language models. By incorporating random Fourier features into lightweight adapter modules, FAA decomposes intermediate representations into complementary low- and high-frequency components, enabling frequency-aware modulation of semantic information. This design allows the model to selectively emphasize informative frequency bands during adaptation while preserving the representational capacity of the frozen backbone. Extensive experiments on GLUE, E2E NLG, and instruction-tuning benchmarks demonstrate that FAA consistently achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, while maintaining low computational and memory overhead. Ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of frequency-aware activation and adaptive weighting mechanisms, highlighting FAA as a robust and efficient approach for post-training large language models.

### [6] [LLM-Guided Exemplar Selection for Few-Shot Wearable-Sensor Human Activity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22385)
*Elsen Ronando,Sozo Inoue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an LLM-Guided Exemplar Selection framework to address limitations in few-shot wearable-sensor Human Activity Recognition (HAR) by integrating semantic reasoning from LLMs with structural/geometric cues, achieving better performance than classical methods on UCI-HAR dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the reliance of state-of-the-art HAR methods on large labeled datasets and their failure to distinguish similar wearable sensor activities (like walking, walking upstairs, downstairs) due to purely geometric exemplar selection.

Method: The framework uses LLM-generated knowledge priors (capturing feature importance, inter-class confusability, exemplar budget multipliers) to guide exemplar scoring and selection, combined with margin-based validation cues, PageRank centrality, hubness penalization, and facility-location optimization.

Result: On the UCI-HAR dataset under strict few-shot conditions, the framework achieves a macro F1-score of 88.78%, outperforming classical approaches like random sampling, herding, and k-center.

Conclusion: LLM-derived semantic priors integrated with structural and geometric cues provide a stronger foundation for selecting representative sensor exemplars in few-shot wearable-sensor HAR.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an LLM-Guided Exemplar Selection framework to address a key limitation in state-of-the-art Human Activity Recognition (HAR) methods: their reliance on large labeled datasets and purely geometric exemplar selection, which often fail to distinguish similar weara-ble sensor activities such as walking, walking upstairs, and walking downstairs. Our method incorporates semantic reasoning via an LLM-generated knowledge prior that captures feature importance, inter-class confusability, and exemplar budget multipliers, and uses it to guide exemplar scoring and selection. These priors are combined with margin-based validation cues, PageRank centrality, hubness penalization, and facility-location optimization to obtain a compact and informative set of exemplars. Evaluated on the UCI-HAR dataset under strict few-shot conditions, the framework achieves a macro F1-score of 88.78%, outperforming classical approaches such as random sampling, herding, and $k$-center. The results show that LLM-derived semantic priors, when integrated with structural and geometric cues, provide a stronger foundation for selecting representative sensor exemplars in few-shot wearable-sensor HAR.

### [7] [Hallucination Detection and Evaluation of Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22416)
*Chenggong Zhang,Haopeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses hallucinations in LLMs by introducing the lightweight HHEM framework to improve detection efficiency while maintaining accuracy, conducts comparative evaluations across tasks/models, and proposes segment-based retrieval for better localized hallucination detection; it also finds larger models have fewer hallucinations and intermediate ones are more unstable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the problem that existing hallucination evaluation methods (like KnowHalu) have high computational costs, while needing to balance efficiency and robust factual validation for LLM-generated content.

Method: 1. Integrate the lightweight Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model (HHEM), a classification-based framework independent of LLM judgments; 2. Conduct comparative analysis of hallucination detection methods across various LLMs, evaluating TPR, TNR, Accuracy on QA and summarization tasks;3. Propose segment-based retrieval to verify smaller text components for localized hallucinations;4. Use cumulative distribution function (CDF) analysis to study hallucination trends across model sizes.

Result: 1. HHEM reduces evaluation time from 8 hours to 10 minutes;2. HHEM with non-fabrication checking achieves highest accuracy (82.2%) and TPR (78.9%);3. HHEM struggles with localized hallucinations in summarization tasks;4. Larger models (7B-9B parameters) generally have fewer hallucinations, intermediate-sized models show higher instability.

Conclusion: Structured evaluation frameworks that balance computational efficiency and robust factual validation are needed to enhance the reliability of LLM-generated content.

Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) pose a significant challenge, generating misleading or unverifiable content that undermines trust and reliability. Existing evaluation methods, such as KnowHalu, employ multi-stage verification but suffer from high computational costs. To address this, we integrate the Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model (HHEM), a lightweight classification-based framework that operates independently of LLM-based judgments, significantly improving efficiency while maintaining high detection accuracy. We conduct a comparative analysis of hallucination detection methods across various LLMs, evaluating True Positive Rate (TPR), True Negative Rate (TNR), and Accuracy on question-answering (QA) and summarization tasks. Our results show that HHEM reduces evaluation time from 8 hours to 10 minutes, while HHEM with non-fabrication checking achieves the highest accuracy \(82.2\%\) and TPR \(78.9\%\). However, HHEM struggles with localized hallucinations in summarization tasks. To address this, we introduce segment-based retrieval, improving detection by verifying smaller text components. Additionally, our cumulative distribution function (CDF) analysis indicates that larger models (7B-9B parameters) generally exhibit fewer hallucinations, while intermediate-sized models show higher instability. These findings highlight the need for structured evaluation frameworks that balance computational efficiency with robust factual validation, enhancing the reliability of LLM-generated content.

Conclusion: HiFi-RAG effectively overcomes the challenges of irrelevant retrieval and intent misalignment in open-domain RAG, achieving superior performance in the competition and on post-cutoff knowledge tasks.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in open-domain settings faces significant challenges regarding irrelevant information in retrieved documents and the alignment of generated answers with user intent. We present HiFi-RAG (Hierarchical Filtering RAG), the winning closed-source system in the Text-to-Text static evaluation of the MMU-RAGent NeurIPS 2025 Competition. Our approach moves beyond standard embedding-based retrieval via a multi-stage pipeline. We leverage the speed and cost-efficiency of Gemini 2.5 Flash (4-6x cheaper than Pro) for query formulation, hierarchical content filtering, and citation attribution, while reserving the reasoning capabilities of Gemini 2.5 Pro for final answer generation.

### [9] [Exploring the Vertical-Domain Reasoning Capabilities of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22443)
*Jie Zhou,Xin Chen,Jie Zhang,Zhe Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study explores integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into accounting by defining vertical-domain accounting reasoning, establishing evaluation criteria, testing models like GLM-series and GPT-4, finding prompt engineering improves performance but current LLMs still need optimization for enterprise accounting applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical challenge of integrating LLMs into professional fields (specifically accounting) to promote enterprise digital transformation and social development, which requires understanding LLMs' domain-specific reasoning capabilities in accounting.

Method: The study introduces vertical-domain accounting reasoning concept, establishes evaluation criteria by analyzing GLM-series models' training data characteristics, then evaluates representative models (GLM-6B, GLM-130B, GLM-4, GPT-4) on accounting reasoning tasks using prompt engineering strategies.

Result: Different prompt engineering strategies improve model performance to varying degrees; GPT-4 shows the strongest accounting reasoning capability, but all current LLMs still fail to meet real-world application requirements, especially needing further optimization for enterprise-level accounting scenarios.

Conclusion: LLMs have potential in accounting but require targeted improvements (like better adaptation to enterprise scenarios) to fully realize their value in the domain.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping learning paradigms, cognitive processes, and research methodologies across a wide range of domains. Integrating LLMs with professional fields and redefining the relationship between LLMs and domain-specific applications has become a critical challenge for promoting enterprise digital transformation and broader social development. To effectively integrate LLMs into the accounting domain, it is essential to understand their domain-specific reasoning capabilities. This study introduces the concept of vertical-domain accounting reasoning and establishes evaluation criteria by analyzing the training data characteristics of representative GLM-series models. These criteria provide a foundation for subsequent research on reasoning paradigms and offer benchmarks for improving accounting reasoning performance. Based on this framework, we evaluate several representative models, including GLM-6B, GLM-130B, GLM-4, and OpenAI GPT-4, on a set of accounting reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that different prompt engineering strategies lead to varying degrees of performance improvement across models, with GPT-4 achieving the strongest accounting reasoning capability. However, current LLMs still fall short of real-world application requirements. In particular, further optimization is needed for deployment in enterprise-level accounting scenarios to fully realize the potential value of LLMs in this domain.

### [10] [Constituency Structure over Eojeol in Korean Treebanks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22487)
*Jungyeul Park,Chulwoo Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the representational question of terminal units in Korean constituency treebanks, arguing for eojeol-based representation with morphological info in a separate layer, showing equivalence between Sejong and Penn Korean treebanks under normalization, and proposing an annotation scheme for cross-treebank comparison and conversion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the representational conflict in Korean constituency treebanks where using morphemes as terminals conflates word-internal morphology with phrase-level syntax and mismatches eojeol-based dependency resources.

Method: Argue for eojeol-based constituency representation with morphological segmentation and fine-grained POS in a non-constituent layer; conduct comparative analysis of Sejong and Penn Korean treebanks under explicit normalization assumptions; outline an eojeol-based annotation scheme.

Result: Sejong and Penn Korean treebanks are representationally equivalent at the eojeol-based constituency level when normalized explicitly.

Conclusion: Eojeol-based constituency representation with separate morphological layer is viable, enabling cross-treebank comparison and constituency-dependency conversion.

Abstract: The design of Korean constituency treebanks raises a fundamental representational question concerning the choice of terminal units. Although Korean words are morphologically complex, treating morphemes as constituency terminals conflates word internal morphology with phrase level syntactic structure and creates mismatches with eojeol based dependency resources. This paper argues for an eojeol based constituency representation, with morphological segmentation and fine grained part of speech information encoded in a separate, non constituent layer. A comparative analysis shows that, under explicit normalization assumptions, the Sejong and Penn Korean treebanks can be treated as representationally equivalent at the eojeol based constituency level. Building on this result, we outline an eojeol based annotation scheme that preserves interpretable constituency and supports cross treebank comparison and constituency dependency conversion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle unique challenges of Manchu speech synthesis: severe data scarcity and strong phonological agglutination.

Method: 1. Three-tier text representation (phoneme, syllable, prosodic); 2. Cross-modal hierarchical attention mechanism for multi-granular alignment; 3. Synthesis model integrating deep convolutional networks with flow-matching Transformer (non-autoregressive); 4. Hierarchical contrastive loss for structured acoustic-linguistic correspondence; 5.

Result: 1. ManchuTTS achieves MOS of 4.52 using a 5.2-hour training subset from 6.24-hour annotated corpus, outperforming all baselines significantly; 2. Ablation studies confirm hierarchical guidance improves agglutinative word pronunciation accuracy (AWPA) by 31% and prosodic naturalness by 27%.

Conclusion: ManchuTTS effectively addresses Manchu's speech synthesis challenges, providing a viable solution for endangered language preservation through high-quality TTS.

Abstract: As an endangered language, Manchu presents unique challenges for speech synthesis, including severe data scarcity and strong phonological agglutination. This paper proposes ManchuTTS(Manchu Text to Speech), a novel approach tailored to Manchu's linguistic characteristics. To handle agglutination, this method designs a three-tier text representation (phoneme, syllable, prosodic) and a cross-modal hierarchical attention mechanism for multi-granular alignment. The synthesis model integrates deep convolutional networks with a flow-matching Transformer, enabling efficient, non-autoregressive generation. This method further introduce a hierarchical contrastive loss to guide structured acoustic-linguistic correspondence. To address low-resource constraints, This method construct the first Manchu TTS dataset and employ a data augmentation strategy. Experiments demonstrate that ManchuTTS attains a MOS of 4.52 using a 5.2-hour training subset derived from our full 6.24-hour annotated corpus, outperforming all baseline models by a notable margin. Ablations confirm hierarchical guidance improves agglutinative word pronunciation accuracy (AWPA) by 31% and prosodic naturalness by 27%.

### [12] [Learning When Not to Attend Globally](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22562)
*Xuan Luo,Kailai Zhang,Xifeng Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes All-or-Here Attention (AHA) which uses binary routers per attention head to toggle between full and local sliding window attention dynamically, reducing up to 93% of full attention operations without performance loss and revealing full attention redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable LLMs to dynamically determine when to attend to global context like humans do when reading (focus on current page, recap prior context only when necessary), aiming for efficient inference.

Method: Propose All-or-Here Attention (AHA) that utilizes a binary router per attention head to dynamically toggle between full attention and local sliding window attention for each token.

Result: With window size of 256 tokens, up to 93% of original full attention operations can be replaced by sliding window attention without performance loss; long-tail distribution in context dependency found where full attention necessity decays rapidly as local window expands.

Conclusion: Full attention is largely redundant, and efficient inference requires only on-demand access to the global context.

Abstract: When reading books, humans focus primarily on the current page, flipping back to recap prior context only when necessary. Similarly, we demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) can learn to dynamically determine when to attend to global context. We propose All-or-Here Attention (AHA), which utilizes a binary router per attention head to dynamically toggle between full attention and local sliding window attention for each token. Our results indicate that with a window size of 256 tokens, up to 93\% of the original full attention operations can be replaced by sliding window attention without performance loss. Furthermore, by evaluating AHA across various window sizes, we identify a long-tail distribution in context dependency, where the necessity for full attention decays rapidly as the local window expands. By decoupling local processing from global access, AHA reveals that full attention is largely redundant, and that efficient inference requires only on-demand access to the global context.

### [13] [Structured Prompting and LLM Ensembling for Multimodal Conversational Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22603)
*Zhiqiang Gao,Shihao Gao,Zixing Zhang,Yihao Guo,Hongyu Chen,Jing Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper describes a system for the Multimodal Conversational Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (MCABSA) Challenge, using structured prompting for Subtask-I (extracting sentiment sextuples) and LLM ensembling for Subtask-II (detecting sentiment flipping), achieving 47.38% average score on Subtask-I and 74.12% exact match F1 on Subtask-II.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complex challenge of understanding sentiment in multimodal conversations and tackle the two subtasks of the MCABSA Challenge: extracting sentiment sextuples and detecting sentiment flipping with triggers.

Method: For Subtask-I: structured prompting pipeline guiding LLMs to sequentially extract sentiment components with refined contextual understanding; For Subtask-II: ensembling three LLMs to leverage their complementary strengths for robust sentiment transition and trigger identification.

Result: The system achieved a 47.38% average score on Subtask-I and a 74.12% exact match F1 on Subtask-II.

Conclusion: Step-wise refinement (structured prompting) and ensemble strategies are effective in rich, multimodal sentiment analysis tasks.

Abstract: Understanding sentiment in multimodal conversations is a complex yet crucial challenge toward building emotionally intelligent AI systems. The Multimodal Conversational Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (MCABSA) Challenge invited participants to tackle two demanding subtasks: (1) extracting a comprehensive sentiment sextuple, including holder, target, aspect, opinion, sentiment, and rationale from multi-speaker dialogues, and (2) detecting sentiment flipping, which detects dynamic sentiment shifts and their underlying triggers. For Subtask-I, in the present paper, we designed a structured prompting pipeline that guided large language models (LLMs) to sequentially extract sentiment components with refined contextual understanding. For Subtask-II, we further leveraged the complementary strengths of three LLMs through ensembling to robustly identify sentiment transitions and their triggers. Our system achieved a 47.38% average score on Subtask-I and a 74.12% exact match F1 on Subtask-II, showing the effectiveness of step-wise refinement and ensemble strategies in rich, multimodal sentiment analysis tasks.

### [14] [Chain-of-thought Reviewing and Correction for Time Series Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22627)
*Chen Su,Yuanhe Tian,Yan Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes T3LLM, a framework with three LLMs (worker, reviewer, student) for time series question answering (TSQA) that uses an explicit correction mechanism to address reasoning errors in complex numerical sequences, achieving state-of-the-art results on real-world benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based TSQA approaches use general NLP techniques and are prone to reasoning errors when handling complex numerical sequences; time series data's inherent verifiability allows consistency checking between reasoning steps and original input, inspiring the need for a correction mechanism.

Method: T3LLM framework has three components: worker (generates step-wise CoT under structured prompts), reviewer (inspects reasoning, identifies errors, provides corrective comments), student (fine-tuned with corrected CoT to internalize multi-step reasoning and self-correction).

Result: Experiments on multiple real-world TSQA benchmarks show T3LLM outperforms strong LLM-based baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: T3LLM's explicit correction mechanism via collaborative worker-reviewer-student framework effectively improves reasoning accuracy for TSQA tasks, leading to superior results over existing approaches.

Abstract: With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), diverse time series analysis tasks are reformulated as time series question answering (TSQA) through a unified natural language interface. However, existing LLM-based approaches largely adopt general natural language processing techniques and are prone to reasoning errors when handling complex numerical sequences. Different from purely textual tasks, time series data are inherently verifiable, enabling consistency checking between reasoning steps and the original input. Motivated by this property, we propose T3LLM, which performs multi-step reasoning with an explicit correction mechanism for time series question answering. The T3LLM framework consists of three LLMs, namely, a worker, a reviewer, and a student, that are responsible for generation, review, and reasoning learning, respectively. Within this framework, the worker generates step-wise chains of thought (CoT) under structured prompts, while the reviewer inspects the reasoning, identifies erroneous steps, and provides corrective comments. The collaboratively generated corrected CoT are used to fine-tune the student model, internalizing multi-step reasoning and self-correction into its parameters. Experiments on multiple real-world TSQA benchmarks demonstrate that T3LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance over strong LLM-based baselines.

### [15] [M2G-Eval: Enhancing and Evaluating Multi-granularity Multilingual Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22628)
*Fanglin Xu,Wei Zhang,Jian Yang,Guo Chen,Aishan Liu,Zhoujun Li,Xianglong Liu,Bryan Dai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces M2G-Eval, a multi-granularity and multilingual framework for evaluating code generation capabilities of LLMs across four levels (Class, Function, Block, Line) in 18 languages, with findings on task difficulty hierarchy, performance gaps in different languages, and cross-language transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for evaluating code generation capabilities of LLMs mainly assess models at a single structural granularity and focus on limited programming languages, which obscures fine-grained capability variations across different code scopes and multilingual scenarios.

Method: The authors developed M2G-Eval, a framework covering four code granularity levels (Class, Function, Block, Line) and 18 programming languages, including 17K+ training tasks and 1,286 human-annotated test instances. They also trained M2G-Eval-Coder models using Qwen3-8B with supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization, then evaluated 30 models (28 state-of-the-art LLMs plus two M2G-Eval-Coder variants).

Result: Three main findings were obtained: (1) Line-level tasks are easiest and Class-level most challenging; (2) Performance gaps between full- and partial-granularity languages widen as task complexity increases; (3) Strong cross-language correlations exist, indicating models learn transferable programming concepts.

Conclusion: M2G-Eval enables fine-grained diagnosis of code generation capabilities and highlights persistent challenges in synthesizing complex, long-form code.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of code large language models (LLMs) has sparked significant research interest in systematically evaluating their code generation capabilities, yet existing benchmarks predominantly assess models at a single structural granularity and focus on limited programming languages, obscuring fine-grained capability variations across different code scopes and multilingual scenarios. We introduce M2G-Eval, a multi-granularity, multilingual framework for evaluating code generation in large language models (LLMs) across four levels: Class, Function, Block, and Line. Spanning 18 programming languages, M2G-Eval includes 17K+ training tasks and 1,286 human-annotated, contamination-controlled test instances. We develop M2G-Eval-Coder models by training Qwen3-8B with supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization. Evaluating 30 models (28 state-of-the-art LLMs plus our two M2G-Eval-Coder variants) reveals three main findings: (1) an apparent difficulty hierarchy, with Line-level tasks easiest and Class-level most challenging; (2) widening performance gaps between full- and partial-granularity languages as task complexity increases; and (3) strong cross-language correlations, suggesting that models learn transferable programming concepts. M2G-Eval enables fine-grained diagnosis of code generation capabilities and highlights persistent challenges in synthesizing complex, long-form code.

### [16] [On the Role of Discreteness in Diffusion LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22630)
*Ziqi Jin,Bin Wang,Xiang Lin,Lidong Bing,Aixin Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper revisits diffusion language modeling, outlines five key properties separating diffusion mechanics from language-specific needs, categorizes existing methods into continuous embedding-space and discrete token-based diffusion (each satisfying only part of the properties), identifies two central issues (uniform corruption ignoring positional info distribution and token-wise marginal training failing to capture multi-token dependencies in parallel decoding), and motivates alignment of diffusion processes with text structure for more coherent models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of applying diffusion models directly to text due to its discrete and highly structured nature, by revisiting diffusion language modeling and identifying gaps between diffusion mechanics and language-specific requirements.

Method: Categorize existing diffusion language modeling approaches into two types: continuous diffusion in embedding space and discrete diffusion over tokens; analyze recent large diffusion language models to identify key issues.

Result: Existing approaches (continuous embedding-space and discrete token-based diffusion) each satisfy only part of the five essential properties separating diffusion mechanics from language needs; two central issues are found: uniform corruption does not respect positional information distribution, and token-wise marginal training fails to capture multi-token dependencies during parallel decoding.

Conclusion: Diffusion processes should be aligned more closely with the structure of text to develop more coherent diffusion language models.

Abstract: Diffusion models offer appealing properties for language generation, such as parallel decoding and iterative refinement, but the discrete and highly structured nature of text challenges the direct application of diffusion principles. In this paper, we revisit diffusion language modeling from the view of diffusion process and language modeling, and outline five properties that separate diffusion mechanics from language-specific requirements. We first categorize existing approaches into continuous diffusion in embedding space and discrete diffusion over tokens. We then show that each satisfies only part of the five essential properties and therefore reflects a structural trade-off. Through analyses of recent large diffusion language models, we identify two central issues: (i) uniform corruption does not respect how information is distributed across positions, and (ii) token-wise marginal training cannot capture multi-token dependencies during parallel decoding. These observations motivate diffusion processes that align more closely with the structure of text, and encourage future work toward more coherent diffusion language models.

### [17] [Evaluating GRPO and DPO for Faithful Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22631)
*Hadi Mohammadi,Tamas Kozak,Anastasia Giachanou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for improving Chain-of-Thought (CoT) faithfulness in LLMs, finding GRPO outperforms DPO in larger models like Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, with positive size-performance correlation and GRPO showing promise for transparent reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CoT explanations often fail to reflect LLMs' actual reasoning (coherent but misleading justifications or unacknowledged answer modifications), undermining reliability for safety supervision and alignment monitoring; need to understand how to improve CoT faithfulness.

Method: Evaluate two optimization methods (GRPO and DPO) on their ability to enhance CoT faithfulness in LLMs.

Result: GRPO achieves higher performance than DPO in larger models; Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct gets best results across metrics; both methods have positive model size-performance correlation; GRPO improves faithfulness metrics but is less stable at smaller scales.

Conclusion: GRPO offers a promising direction for developing more transparent and trustworthy reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful technique for improving the problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly for tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. However, recent studies show that CoT explanations often fail to reflect the model's actual reasoning process, as models may produce coherent yet misleading justifications or modify answers without acknowledging external cues. Such discrepancies undermine the reliability of CoT-based methods for safety supervision and alignment monitoring, as models can generate plausible but deceptive rationales for incorrect answers. To better understand this limitation, we evaluate two optimization methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), in their ability to improve CoT faithfulness. Our experiments show that GRPO achieves higher performance than DPO in larger models, with the Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct model attaining the best results across all evaluation metrics. Both approaches exhibit positive correlations between model size and performance, but GRPO shows greater potential for improving faithfulness metrics, albeit with less stable behavior at smaller scales. These results suggest that GRPO offers a promising direction for developing more transparent and trustworthy reasoning in LLMs.

### [18] [Conformal Prediction Sets for Next-Token Prediction in Large Language Models: Balancing Coverage Guarantees with Set Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22682)
*Yoshith Roy Kotla,Varshith Roy Kotla*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies Adaptive Prediction Sets (APS) for next-token prediction in large-vocabulary LLMs, proposes Vocabulary-Aware Conformal Prediction (VACP) to balance coverage and efficiency, showing a 197x reduction in prediction set size while maintaining target coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard softmax probabilities in LLMs are poorly calibrated, and naive conformal prediction for next-token prediction produces uninformative large prediction sets (hundreds of tokens), which is a problem for deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains requiring rigorous uncertainty quantification.

Method: The paper proposes Vocabulary-Aware Conformal Prediction (VACP), a framework that uses semantic masking and temperature-adjusted scoring to reduce the effective prediction space while provably maintaining marginal coverage.

Result: Experiments on Gemma-2B with SQUAD and WikiText benchmarks show VACP achieves 89.7% empirical coverage (close to the 90% target) and reduces mean prediction set size from 847 tokens to 4.3 tokens, a 197x improvement in efficiency.

Conclusion: VACP effectively balances coverage and efficiency for next-token prediction in large-vocabulary LLMs, providing a practical solution for uncertainty quantification in high-stakes LLM deployments; the authors also provide theoretical analysis of vocabulary reduction and release their implementation for reproducibility.

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains requires rigorous uncertainty quantification, yet standard softmax probabilities are often poorly calibrated. We present a systematic study of Adaptive Prediction Sets (APS) applied to next-token prediction in transformer-based models with large vocabularies (greater than 250,000 tokens). Our central contribution is the identification of a coverage-efficiency tradeoff: while naive conformal prediction achieves valid coverage, it produces prediction sets of hundreds of tokens, rendering them uninformative. We propose Vocabulary-Aware Conformal Prediction (VACP), a framework that leverages semantic masking and temperature-adjusted scoring to reduce the effective prediction space while provably maintaining marginal coverage. Experiments on Gemma-2B using SQUAD and WikiText benchmarks demonstrate that VACP achieves 89.7 percent empirical coverage (90 percent target) while reducing the mean prediction set size from 847 tokens to 4.3 tokens -- a 197x improvement in efficiency. We provide a theoretical analysis of vocabulary reduction and release our implementation for reproducibility.

*Ahmed Abdullah,Sana Fatima,Haroon Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the underrepresentation of hope speech in NLP, especially for low-resource languages like Urdu, by proposing a multilingual framework using pretrained transformers (XLM-RoBERTa, mBERT, EuroBERT, UrduBERT) which achieves strong F1-scores on the PolyHope-M 2025 benchmark, enabling hope speech detection in low-resource settings to foster constructive digital discourse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hope speech is understudied in NLP; current work focuses on English, leaving low-resource languages like Urdu with few resources, limiting tools for positive online communication. Also, transformer models are effective for hate/offensive speech but underapplied to hope speech across linguistic settings.

Method: A multilingual framework for hope speech detection focused on Urdu, using pretrained transformer models (XLM-RoBERTa, mBERT, EuroBERT, UrduBERT) with simple preprocessing and classifier training.

Result: Evaluations on PolyHope-M 2025 benchmark show strong performance: 95.2% F1-score for Urdu binary classification,65.2% for Urdu multi-class classification; competitive results in Spanish, German, and English.

Conclusion: Existing multilingual models can be effectively implemented in low-resource environments to identify hope speech, aiding in building more constructive digital discourse.

Abstract: Hope speech has been relatively underrepresented in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Current studies are largely focused on English, which has resulted in a lack of resources for low-resource languages such as Urdu. As a result, the creation of tools that facilitate positive online communication remains limited. Although transformer-based architectures have proven to be effective in detecting hate and offensive speech, little has been done to apply them to hope speech or, more generally, to test them across a variety of linguistic settings. This paper presents a multilingual framework for hope speech detection with a focus on Urdu. Using pretrained transformer models such as XLM-RoBERTa, mBERT, EuroBERT, and UrduBERT, we apply simple preprocessing and train classifiers for improved results. Evaluations on the PolyHope-M 2025 benchmark demonstrate strong performance, achieving F1-scores of 95.2% for Urdu binary classification and 65.2% for Urdu multi-class classification, with similarly competitive results in Spanish, German, and English. These results highlight the possibility of implementing existing multilingual models in low-resource environments, thus making it easier to identify hope speech and helping to build a more constructive digital discourse.

*Anaelia Ovalle,Candace Ross,Sebastian Ruder,Adina Williams,Karen Ullrich,Mark Ibrahim,Levent Sagun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the cross-language transfer of reasoning quality in large language models (LLMs) via chain-of-thought prompting, finding that while task accuracy is high, reasoning traces often fail to support conclusions—especially in non-Latin scripts, with misalignment twice as much as Latin scripts; it also develops an error taxonomy and argues for reasoning-aware multilingual evaluation frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether the reasoning quality of LLMs (demonstrated via chain-of-thought prompting) transfers across languages, as current multilingual evaluation practices may not fully capture reasoning capabilities.

Method: A human-validated framework is used to assess if model-generated reasoning traces logically support conclusions; 65k traces from GlobalMMLU questions across 6 languages and 6 frontier models are analyzed, and a human-annotated error taxonomy is developed.

Result: Models achieve high task accuracy but have reasoning traces that fail to support conclusions; non-Latin script traces show at least twice the misalignment between reasoning and conclusions compared to Latin scripts; errors mainly stem from evidential issues (unsupported claims, ambiguous facts) followed by illogical steps.

Conclusion: Current multilingual evaluation practices are incomplete in reflecting model reasoning capabilities, emphasizing the need for reasoning-aware evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities through chain-of-thought prompting, but whether this reasoning quality transfers across languages remains underexplored. We introduce a human-validated framework to evaluate whether model-generated reasoning traces logically support their conclusions across languages. Analyzing 65k reasoning traces from GlobalMMLU questions across 6 languages and 6 frontier models, we uncover a critical blind spot: while models achieve high task accuracy, their reasoning can fail to support their conclusions. Reasoning traces in non-Latin scripts show at least twice as much misalignment between their reasoning and conclusions than those in Latin scripts. We develop an error taxonomy through human annotation to characterize these failures, finding they stem primarily from evidential errors (unsupported claims, ambiguous facts) followed by illogical reasoning steps. Our findings demonstrate that current multilingual evaluation practices provide an incomplete picture of model reasoning capabilities and highlight the need for reasoning-aware evaluation frameworks.

### [21] [Mitigating Social Desirability Bias in Random Silicon Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22725)
*Sashank Chapala,Maksym Mironov,Songgaojun Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether psychologically grounded prompt wording can mitigate Social Desirability Bias (SDB) in LLM-based Silicon Sampling, finding reformulated prompts most effective for aligning LLM responses with real human data from ANES.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies on SDB in LLM-based sampling are limited; the work aims to address this by testing prompt-based methods to reduce SDB and improve alignment between silicon and human samples.

Method: The study uses ANES data and tests four prompt-based mitigation methods (reformulated, reverse-coded, priming, preamble) on Llama-3.1 series and GPT-4.1-mini. Alignment is evaluated via Jensen-Shannon Divergence with bootstrap confidence intervals.

Result: Reformulated prompts most effectively improved alignment by reducing distribution concentration on socially acceptable answers; reverse-coding had mixed results; priming and preamble showed no systematic benefit and encouraged uniformity.

Conclusion: Prompt-based framing controls (especially reformulated prompts) are effective in mitigating SDB in LLMs, offering a practical path to more representative silicon samples.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate population responses, a method known as ``Silicon Sampling''. However, responses to socially sensitive questions frequently exhibit Social Desirability Bias (SDB), diverging from real human data toward socially acceptable answers. Existing studies on social desirability bias in LLM-based sampling remain limited. In this work, we investigate whether minimal, psychologically grounded prompt wording can mitigate this bias and improve alignment between silicon and human samples. We conducted a study using data from the American National Election Study (ANES) on three LLMs from two model families: the open-source Llama-3.1 series and GPT-4.1-mini. We first replicate a baseline silicon sampling study, confirming the persistent Social Desirability Bias. We then test four prompt-based mitigation methods: \emph{reformulated} (neutral, third-person phrasing), \emph{reverse-coded} (semantic inversion), and two meta-instructions, \emph{priming} and \emph{preamble}, respectively encouraging analytics and sincerity. Alignment with ANES is evaluated using Jensen-Shannon Divergence with bootstrap confidence intervals. Our results demonstrate that reformulated prompts most effectively improve alignment by reducing distribution concentration on socially acceptable answers and achieving distributions closer to ANES. Reverse-coding produced mixed results across eligible items, while the Priming and Preamble encouraged response uniformity and showed no systematic benefit for bias mitigation. Our findings validate the efficacy of prompt-based framing controls in mitigating inherent Social Desirability Bias in LLMs, providing a practical path toward more representative silicon samples.

### [22] [Data Augmentation for Classification of Negative Pregnancy Outcomes in Imbalanced Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22732)
*Md Badsha Biswas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores using social media data (like Twitter) to enhance datasets for studying negative pregnancy outcomes, addressing data challenges with preprocessing and NLP pipelines, and demonstrates social media's viability as an adjunct in epidemiological pregnancy outcome research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infant mortality is a key public health issue in the US, with birth defects as a leading cause; existing research on negative pregnancy outcomes (miscarriage, stillbirths, etc.) lacks comprehensive data and strategies, so there's a need for more resources to improve understanding and intervention.

Method: The paper introduces a novel approach using publicly available social media data, employs robust preprocessing techniques and data augmentation to tackle data imbalance, noise, and lack of structure, and constructs an NLP pipeline to identify pregnant women sharing experiences, classifying them into positive (full gestation, normal birth weight) or negative outcome cases.

Result: The study showcases the viability of social media data as an adjunctive resource in epidemiological investigations about pregnancy outcomes, and provides a framework for future health studies involving pregnant cohorts and comparator groups.

Conclusion: Social media data can be effectively used to enhance datasets for studying pregnancy outcomes, offering potential applications in assessing causal impacts of interventions/treatments/exposures on maternal and fetal health, and serving as a valuable tool for future epidemiological research in this area.

Abstract: Infant mortality remains a significant public health concern in the United States, with birth defects identified as a leading cause. Despite ongoing efforts to understand the causes of negative pregnancy outcomes like miscarriage, stillbirths, birth defects, and premature birth, there is still a need for more comprehensive research and strategies for intervention. This paper introduces a novel approach that uses publicly available social media data, especially from platforms like Twitter, to enhance current datasets for studying negative pregnancy outcomes through observational research. The inherent challenges in utilizing social media data, including imbalance, noise, and lack of structure, necessitate robust preprocessing techniques and data augmentation strategies. By constructing a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline, we aim to automatically identify women sharing their pregnancy experiences, categorizing them based on reported outcomes. Women reporting full gestation and normal birth weight will be classified as positive cases, while those reporting negative pregnancy outcomes will be identified as negative cases. Furthermore, this study offers potential applications in assessing the causal impact of specific interventions, treatments, or prenatal exposures on maternal and fetal health outcomes. Additionally, it provides a framework for future health studies involving pregnant cohorts and comparator groups. In a broader context, our research showcases the viability of social media data as an adjunctive resource in epidemiological investigations about pregnancy outcomes.

### [23] [WeDLM: Reconciling Diffusion Language Models with Standard Causal Attention for Fast Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22737)
*Aiwei Liu,Minghua He,Shaoxun Zeng,Sijun Zhang,Linhao Zhang,Chuhan Wu,Wei Jia,Yuan Liu,Xiao Zhou,Jie Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes WeDLM, a diffusion decoding framework using causal attention to enable prefix-cache friendly parallel generation, achieving speedups over optimized AR engines (vLLM) while preserving quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR generation's token-by-token nature limits inference parallelism; DLLMs offer parallel decoding but rely on bidirectional attention which breaks prefix KV caching, reducing efficiency compared to optimized AR engines like vLLM.

Method: WeDLM uses causal attention via Topological Reordering (moving observed tokens to physical prefix while preserving logical positions) and a streaming decoding procedure that commits confident tokens to a left-to-right prefix, maintaining fixed parallel workload without stop-and-wait behavior.

Result: WeDLM preserves quality of strong AR backbones, delivers ~3x speedup on challenging reasoning benchmarks and up to 10x in low-entropy regimes; outperforms vLLM-served AR baselines under matched deployment settings.

Conclusion: Diffusion-style decoding (WeDLM) can outperform optimized AR engines in practice by leveraging causal attention for prefix-cache friendly parallel generation.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) generation is the standard decoding paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs), but its token-by-token nature limits parallelism at inference time. Diffusion Language Models (DLLMs) offer parallel decoding by recovering multiple masked tokens per step; however, in practice they often fail to translate this parallelism into deployment speed gains over optimized AR engines (e.g., vLLM). A key reason is that many DLLMs rely on bidirectional attention, which breaks standard prefix KV caching and forces repeated contextualization, undermining efficiency. We propose WeDLM, a diffusion decoding framework built entirely on standard causal attention to make parallel generation prefix-cache friendly. The core idea is to let each masked position condition on all currently observed tokens while keeping a strict causal mask, achieved by Topological Reordering that moves observed tokens to the physical prefix while preserving their logical positions. Building on this property, we introduce a streaming decoding procedure that continuously commits confident tokens into a growing left-to-right prefix and maintains a fixed parallel workload, avoiding the stop-and-wait behavior common in block diffusion methods. Experiments show that WeDLM preserves the quality of strong AR backbones while delivering substantial speedups, approaching 3x on challenging reasoning benchmarks and up to 10x in low-entropy generation regimes; critically, our comparisons are against AR baselines served by vLLM under matched deployment settings, demonstrating that diffusion-style decoding can outperform an optimized AR engine in practice.

*Dongning Rao,Yunbiao Zeng,Zhihua Jiang,Jujian Lv*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes TEXT, a model for Multi-modal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) that leverages explanations from Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and temporal alignment of audio/video representations, outperforming existing models and MLLMs across four datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MSA approaches underexplore the power of explanations and temporal alignments, so this work aims to address these gaps.

Method: TEXT uses MLLMs to augment explanations for MSA, aligns audio/video representations via a temporality-oriented block (combining Mamba and temporal cross-attention), and employs a text-routed sparse mixture-of-experts with gate fusion.

Result: TEXT achieves best performance across four datasets, winning at least four out of six metrics; e.g., 13.5% lower mean absolute error (0.353) than recent approaches on CH-SIMS dataset.

Conclusion: TEXT effectively integrates explanations and temporal alignment to improve MSA performance, outperforming existing models and MLLMs.

Abstract: Human-interaction-involved applications underscore the need for Multi-modal Sentiment Analysis (MSA). Although many approaches have been proposed to address the subtle emotions in different modalities, the power of explanations and temporal alignments is still underexplored. Thus, this paper proposes the Text-routed sparse mixture-of-Experts model with eXplanation and Temporal alignment for MSA (TEXT). TEXT first augments explanations for MSA via Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLM), and then novelly aligns the epresentations of audio and video through a temporality-oriented neural network block. TEXT aligns different modalities with explanations and facilitates a new text-routed sparse mixture-of-experts with gate fusion. Our temporal alignment block merges the benefits of Mamba and temporal cross-attention. As a result, TEXT achieves the best performance cross four datasets among all tested models, including three recently proposed approaches and three MLLMs. TEXT wins on at least four metrics out of all six metrics. For example, TEXT decreases the mean absolute error to 0.353 on the CH-SIMS dataset, which signifies a 13.5% decrement compared with recently proposed approaches.

### [25] [Fake News Classification in Urdu: A Domain Adaptation Approach for a Low-Resource Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22778)
*Muhammad Zain Ali,Bernhard Pfahringer,Tony Smith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the lack of attention to misinformation detection in low-resource languages like Urdu by investigating domain adaptation before fine-tuning multilingual models (XLM-RoBERTa and mBERT) using an Urdu news corpus, finding domain-adapted XLM-R consistently outperforms vanilla XLM-R while mBERT shows mixed results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the limited attention given to misinformation detection in low-resource languages such as Urdu, where multilingual pretrained models often struggle with domain-specific terms leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: The method involves a staged training approach: first applying domain-adaptive pretraining on a publicly available Urdu news corpus to multilingual models (XLM-RoBERTa and mBERT), then fine-tuning them for fake news classification.

Result: Experiments on four public Urdu fake news datasets show domain-adapted XLM-RoBERTa consistently outperforms its vanilla version, whereas domain-adapted mBERT yields mixed results.

Conclusion: Domain adaptation before fine-tuning improves the performance of XLM-RoBERTa for Urdu fake news detection, though its effect on mBERT is inconsistent; this approach is a viable solution for enhancing misinformation detection in low-resource languages like Urdu.

Abstract: Misinformation on social media is a widely acknowledged issue, and researchers worldwide are actively engaged in its detection. However, low-resource languages such as Urdu have received limited attention in this domain. An obvious approach is to utilize a multilingual pretrained language model and fine-tune it for a downstream classification task, such as misinformation detection. However, these models struggle with domain-specific terms, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we investigate the effectiveness of domain adaptation before fine-tuning for fake news classification in Urdu, employing a staged training approach to optimize model generalization. We evaluate two widely used multilingual models, XLM-RoBERTa and mBERT, and apply domain-adaptive pretraining using a publicly available Urdu news corpus. Experiments on four publicly available Urdu fake news datasets show that domain-adapted XLM-R consistently outperforms its vanilla counterpart, while domain-adapted mBERT exhibits mixed results.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates rule-based baselines, domain-specific transformer models, and large language models for clinical note segmentation using 1,000 MIMIC-IV notes, finding large API-based models (e.g., GPT-5-mini with 72.4 average F1) perform best, while lightweight baselines work for structured tasks but struggle with unstructured freetext; results guide method selection for downstream clinical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical notes from EMR systems are often unstructured/semi-structured, hindering secondary analysis and downstream clinical applications; reliable section boundary identification is critical for structuring these notes to unlock their value.

Method: The study evaluates three types of models for clinical note segmentation: rule-based baselines, domain-specific transformer models, and large language models, using a curated dataset of 1,000 notes from MIMIC-IV.

Result: Large API-based models achieve the best overall performance (GPT-5-mini reaches an average F1 of 72.4 across sentence-level and freetext segmentation); lightweight baselines are competitive on structured sentence-level tasks but perform poorly on unstructured freetext.

Conclusion: The results provide guidance for method selection in clinical note segmentation and lay the groundwork for downstream tasks like information extraction, cohort identification, and automated summarization.

Abstract: Clinical notes are often stored in unstructured or semi-structured formats after extraction from electronic medical record (EMR) systems, which complicates their use for secondary analysis and downstream clinical applications. Reliable identification of section boundaries is a key step toward structuring these notes, as sections such as history of present illness, medications, and discharge instructions each provide distinct clinical contexts. In this work, we evaluate rule-based baselines, domain-specific transformer models, and large language models for clinical note segmentation using a curated dataset of 1,000 notes from MIMIC-IV. Our experiments show that large API-based models achieve the best overall performance, with GPT-5-mini reaching a best average F1 of 72.4 across sentence-level and freetext segmentation. Lightweight baselines remain competitive on structured sentence-level tasks but falter on unstructured freetext. Our results provide guidance for method selection and lay the groundwork for downstream tasks such as information extraction, cohort identification, and automated summarization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses limitations in reinforcement learning (RL) for language agents in simulated environments (semi-automated synthesis, low task difficulty, unstable users, heterogeneous environments) by proposing a unified pipeline for automated, scalable synthesis of high-difficulty verifiable tasks and an environment-level RL algorithm to mitigate user instability and improve training efficiency/stability; evaluations on tau-bench, tau2-Bench, VitaBench show effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address key limitations in applying RL to language-based agents in simulated environments: 1) previous environment synthesis is semi-automated, lacking breadth/depth; 2) tasks are insufficiently difficult; 3) simulated users are unstable; 4) environments are heterogeneous, hindering RL training.

Method: Two main contributions: 1) A unified pipeline for automated, scalable synthesis of simulated environments with high-difficulty but easily verifiable tasks; 2) An environment-level RL algorithm that mitigates simulated user instability and performs advantage estimation at the environment level to boost training efficiency and stability.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on three agentic benchmarks (tau-bench, tau2-Bench, VitaBench) validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and further in-depth analyses demonstrate its out-of-domain generalization capability.

Conclusion: The proposed unified environment synthesis pipeline and environment-level RL algorithm effectively overcome existing limitations in RL for language agents, showing strong performance on standard benchmarks and good out-of-domain generalization.

Abstract: Conducting reinforcement learning (RL) in simulated environments offers a cost-effective and highly scalable way to enhance language-based agents. However, previous work has been limited to semi-automated environment synthesis or tasks lacking sufficient difficulty, offering little breadth or depth. In addition, the instability of simulated users integrated into these environments, along with the heterogeneity across simulated environments, poses further challenges for agentic RL. In this work, we propose: (1) a unified pipeline for automated and scalable synthesis of simulated environments associated with high-difficulty but easily verifiable tasks; and (2) an environment level RL algorithm that not only effectively mitigates user instability but also performs advantage estimation at the environment level, thereby improving training efficiency and stability. Comprehensive evaluations on agentic benchmarks, including tau-bench, tau2-Bench, and VitaBench, validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Further in-depth analyses underscore its out-of-domain generalization.

### [28] [Diversity or Precision? A Deep Dive into Next Token Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22955)
*Haoyuan Wu,Hai Wang,Jiajia Wu,Jinxiang Ou,Keyao Wang,Weile Chen,Zihao Zheng,Bei Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper revisits the cross-entropy loss as a single-step policy gradient, proposes a generalized pre-training objective with reward-shaping (balancing diversity/precision via positive scaling and rank-aware asymmetric treatment of negatives) to reshape LLM token distributions for RL, and finds precision-oriented priors outperform high-entropy ones for RL exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical dependence of RL training effectiveness for LLMs on the exploration space defined by the pre-trained model's token-output distribution, and to systematically study how pre-trained distributions shape RL exploration potential.

Method: 1) Interpret cross-entropy loss as single-step policy gradient; 2) Propose generalized pre-training objective adapting on-policy RL principles to supervised learning; 3) Frame next-token prediction as stochastic decision process with reward-shaping (positive scaling factor for ground-truth concentration, rank-aware asymmetric handling of negative tokens); 4) Reshape pre-trained distribution to optimize RL exploration space.

Result: Contrary to intuition that higher entropy aids exploration, a precision-oriented prior yields a superior exploration space for RL.

Conclusion: Precision-oriented priors in pre-trained LLM token distributions are more beneficial for RL exploration than high-entropy ones; the proposed generalized pre-training objective with reward-shaping effectively optimizes the exploration space for subsequent RL training.

Abstract: Recent advancements have shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can substantially improve the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). The effectiveness of such RL training, however, depends critically on the exploration space defined by the pre-trained model's token-output distribution. In this paper, we revisit the standard cross-entropy loss, interpreting it as a specific instance of policy gradient optimization applied within a single-step episode. To systematically study how the pre-trained distribution shapes the exploration potential for subsequent RL, we propose a generalized pre-training objective that adapts on-policy RL principles to supervised learning. By framing next-token prediction as a stochastic decision process, we introduce a reward-shaping strategy that explicitly balances diversity and precision. Our method employs a positive reward scaling factor to control probability concentration on ground-truth tokens and a rank-aware mechanism that treats high-ranking and low-ranking negative tokens asymmetrically. This allows us to reshape the pre-trained token-output distribution and investigate how to provide a more favorable exploration space for RL, ultimately enhancing end-to-end reasoning performance. Contrary to the intuition that higher distribution entropy facilitates effective exploration, we find that imposing a precision-oriented prior yields a superior exploration space for RL.

### [29] [Prompt engineering does not universally improve Large Language Model performance across clinical decision-making tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22966)
*Mengdi Chai,Ali R. Zomorrodi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates three state-of-the-art LLMs (ChatGPT-4o, Gemini1.5 Pro, Llama3.3 70B) in clinical decision support tasks, examines the effect of prompt engineering (MedPrompt variations with targeted/random dynamic few-shot learning) on their performance, and finds task/model-dependent impacts highlighting need for tailored strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the practical utility of LLMs in real-world clinical decision-making, as their promise in medical knowledge assessments is underexplored in this context.

Method: 1) Evaluate three LLMs on 36 case studies across five sequential clinical decision-making tasks under default and zero temperature settings. 2) Apply prompt engineering with targeted and random dynamic few-shot learning variations to assess performance changes.

Result: 1) LLMs show high task variability: near-perfect final diagnosis accuracy, poor relevant diagnostic testing accuracy, moderate performance on others; ChatGPT better at zero temp, Llama at default. 2) Prompt engineering is not one-size-fit-all: significantly improves lowest baseline task (relevant diagnostic testing) but is counterproductive for others; targeted dynamic few-shot does not consistently outperform random selection.

Conclusion: The impact of prompt engineering on LLMs in clinical decision support is highly model and task-dependent, emphasizing the need for tailored, context-aware strategies for integrating LLMs into healthcare.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in medical knowledge assessments, yet their practical utility in real-world clinical decision-making remains underexplored. In this study, we evaluated the performance of three state-of-the-art LLMs-ChatGPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and LIama 3.3 70B-in clinical decision support across the entire clinical reasoning workflow of a typical patient encounter. Using 36 case studies, we first assessed LLM's out-of-the-box performance across five key sequential clinical decision-making tasks under two temperature settings (default vs. zero): differential diagnosis, essential immediate steps, relevant diagnostic testing, final diagnosis, and treatment recommendation. All models showed high variability by task, achieving near-perfect accuracy in final diagnosis, poor performance in relevant diagnostic testing, and moderate performance in remaining tasks. Furthermore, ChatGPT performed better under the zero temperature, whereas LIama showed stronger performance under the default temperature. Next, we assessed whether prompt engineering could enhance LLM performance by applying variations of the MedPrompt framework, incorporating targeted and random dynamic few-shot learning. The results demonstrate that prompt engineering is not a one-size-fit-all solution. While it significantly improved the performance on the task with lowest baseline accuracy (relevant diagnostic testing), it was counterproductive for others. Another key finding was that the targeted dynamic few-shot prompting did not consistently outperform random selection, indicating that the presumed benefits of closely matched examples may be counterbalanced by loss of broader contextual diversity. These findings suggest that the impact of prompt engineering is highly model and task-dependent, highlighting the need for tailored, context-aware strategies for integrating LLMs into healthcare.

### [30] [Interpretable Safety Alignment via SAE-Constructed Low-Rank Subspace Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23260)
*Dianyun Wang,Qingsen Ma,Yuhu Shang,Zhifeng Lu,Lechen Ning,Zhenbo Xu,Huijia Wu,Zhaofeng He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes an interpretable parameter-efficient fine-tuning method using pre-trained Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to address polysemanticity in low-rank adaptation, improving performance and transparency especially in safety alignment tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing low-rank adaptation methods like LoRA learn task-relevant subspaces implicitly in a black-box way without interpretability or direct control, which is attributed to polysemanticity (individual dimensions encoding multiple entangled concepts).

Method: The method leverages pre-trained Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant features in a disentangled feature space, then constructs an explicit, interpretable low-rank subspace to guide adapter initialization.

Result: On safety alignment tasks, the method achieves up to 99.6% safety rate—exceeding full fine-tuning by 7.4 percentage points and approaching RLHF-based methods—while updating only 0.19-0.24% of parameters. It also provides interpretable insights into the learned alignment subspace via semantic grounding of SAE features.

Conclusion: Incorporating mechanistic interpretability into the fine-tuning process can simultaneously improve both performance and transparency of parameter-efficient fine-tuning for large language models.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning has become the dominant paradigm for adapting large language models to downstream tasks. Low-rank adaptation methods such as LoRA operate under the assumption that task-relevant weight updates reside in a low-rank subspace, yet this subspace is learned implicitly from data in a black-box manner, offering no interpretability or direct control. We hypothesize that this difficulty stems from polysemanticity--individual dimensions encoding multiple entangled concepts. To address this, we leverage pre-trained Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant features in a disentangled feature space, then construct an explicit, interpretable low-rank subspace to guide adapter initialization. We provide theoretical analysis proving that under monosemanticity assumptions, SAE-based subspace identification achieves arbitrarily small recovery error, while direct identification in polysemantic space suffers an irreducible error floor. On safety alignment, our method achieves up to 99.6% safety rate--exceeding full fine-tuning by 7.4 percentage points and approaching RLHF-based methods--while updating only 0.19-0.24% of parameters. Crucially, our method provides interpretable insights into the learned alignment subspace through the semantic grounding of SAE features. Our work demonstrates that incorporating mechanistic interpretability into the fine-tuning process can simultaneously improve both performance and transparency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study addresses the issue of hosts using morphs in Chinese e-commerce live streams (e.g., Douyin) for false advertising by introducing the Live Auditory Morph Resolution (LiveAMR) task, constructing a dataset, and using LLMs to enhance detection performance, showing improved regulation effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To detect pronunciation-based morph evasion in health and medical live streams (used by hosts to evade scrutiny and engage in false advertising), a gap not addressed by previous text-based morph research.

Method: Introduce the LiveAMR task, construct a dataset of 86,790 samples, transform the task into text-to-text generation, and leverage LLMs to generate additional training data.

Result: The method improves performance in detecting morph violations, and morph resolution significantly enhances live streaming regulation.

Conclusion: The LiveAMR task and associated dataset/method effectively address the problem of pronunciation-based morph evasion in live streams, aiding in better regulation.

Abstract: E-commerce live streaming in China, particularly on platforms like Douyin, has become a major sales channel, but hosts often use morphs to evade scrutiny and engage in false advertising. This study introduces the Live Auditory Morph Resolution (LiveAMR) task to detect such violations. Unlike previous morph research focused on text-based evasion in social media and underground industries, LiveAMR targets pronunciation-based evasion in health and medical live streams. We constructed the first LiveAMR dataset with 86,790 samples and developed a method to transform the task into a text-to-text generation problem. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate additional training data, we improved performance and demonstrated that morph resolution significantly enhances live streaming regulation.

TL;DR: This paper proposes AI4Reading, a multi-agent collaboration system using LLMs and speech synthesis to automate audiobook interpretation creation, addressing manual process inefficiencies; results show its scripts are simpler and accurate despite speech quality gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The manual creation of audiobook interpretations is time-consuming and resource-intensive, prompting the need for an automated solution.

Method: AI4Reading is a multi-agent system with 11 specialized agents (topic analysts, case analysts, editors, narrator, proofreaders) collaborating to explore themes, extract real-world cases, refine content organization, and synthesize natural spoken language, leveraging LLMs and speech synthesis.

Result: Compared to expert interpretations, AI4Reading's generated scripts are simpler and more accurate, though it still lags in speech generation quality.

Conclusion: AI4Reading provides an effective automated approach for audiobook interpretation creation, with strengths in script quality but room for improvement in speech synthesis.

Abstract: Audiobook interpretations are attracting increasing attention, as they provide accessible and in-depth analyses of books that offer readers practical insights and intellectual inspiration. However, their manual creation process remains time-consuming and resource-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose AI4Reading, a multi-agent collaboration system leveraging large language models (LLMs) and speech synthesis technology to generate podcast, like audiobook interpretations. The system is designed to meet three key objectives: accurate content preservation, enhanced comprehensibility, and a logical narrative structure. To achieve these goals, we develop a framework composed of 11 specialized agents,including topic analysts, case analysts, editors, a narrator, and proofreaders that work in concert to explore themes, extract real world cases, refine content organization, and synthesize natural spoken language. By comparing expert interpretations with our system's output, the results show that although AI4Reading still has a gap in speech generation quality, the generated interpretative scripts are simpler and more accurate.

Motivation: To bridge the interdisciplinary barrier that prevents existing works from fully assimilating the essence of human memory mechanisms for designing efficient memory workflows in autonomous agents.

Method: Systematically synthesize interdisciplinary memory knowledge by: 1) Elucidating memory definition/function from cognitive neuroscience to LLMs and agents; 2) Comparative analysis of memory taxonomy, storage mechanisms, and management lifecycle from biological and artificial perspectives; 3) Reviewing mainstream benchmarks for agent memory; 4) Exploring memory security from attack and defense angles; 5) Envisioning future research directions.

Result: The paper presents a comprehensive synthesis of memory-related knowledge across cognitive neuroscience and LLM-driven agents, covering key aspects like definition, taxonomy, storage, lifecycle, benchmarks, security, and future directions.

Conclusion: The synthesis of interdisciplinary memory knowledge helps bridge gaps between cognitive neuroscience and AI agents, and future research should focus on areas like multimodal memory systems and skill acquisition.

Abstract: Memory serves as the pivotal nexus bridging past and future, providing both humans and AI systems with invaluable concepts and experience to navigate complex tasks. Recent research on autonomous agents has increasingly focused on designing efficient memory workflows by drawing on cognitive neuroscience. However, constrained by interdisciplinary barriers, existing works struggle to assimilate the essence of human memory mechanisms. To bridge this gap, we systematically synthesizes interdisciplinary knowledge of memory, connecting insights from cognitive neuroscience with LLM-driven agents. Specifically, we first elucidate the definition and function of memory along a progressive trajectory from cognitive neuroscience through LLMs to agents. We then provide a comparative analysis of memory taxonomy, storage mechanisms, and the complete management lifecycle from both biological and artificial perspectives. Subsequently, we review the mainstream benchmarks for evaluating agent memory. Additionally, we explore memory security from dual perspectives of attack and defense. Finally, we envision future research directions, with a focus on multimodal memory systems and skill acquisition.

### [34] [A Stepwise-Enhanced Reasoning Framework for Large Language Models Based on External Subgraph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23356)
*Xin Zhang,Yang Cao,Baoxing Wu,Xinyi Chen,Kai Song,Siying Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes SGR, a stepwise reasoning enhancement framework for LLMs using external subgraph generation, which outperforms baselines on reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with deep reasoning and logical inference due to incorporating noisy/irrelevant info from training corpora, leading to incorrect or inconsistent outputs.

Method: SGR dynamically constructs query-relevant subgraphs from external knowledge bases, guides multi-step reasoning over these subgraphs, and integrates multiple reasoning paths for the final answer.

Result: Experimental results on multiple benchmarks show SGR consistently outperforms strong baselines.

Conclusion: SGR effectively enhances LLMs' reasoning capabilities by reducing noisy info influence via structured subgraph-based stepwise reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks in recent years, including machine translation, text generation, and question answering. As their applications extend to increasingly complex scenarios, however, LLMs continue to face challenges in tasks that require deep reasoning and logical inference. In particular, models trained on large scale textual corpora may incorporate noisy or irrelevant information during generation, which can lead to incorrect predictions or outputs that are inconsistent with factual knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose a stepwise reasoning enhancement framework for LLMs based on external subgraph generation, termed SGR. The proposed framework dynamically constructs query relevant subgraphs from external knowledge bases and leverages their semantic structure to guide the reasoning process. By performing reasoning in a step by step manner over structured subgraphs, SGR reduces the influence of noisy information and improves reasoning accuracy. Specifically, the framework first generates an external subgraph tailored to the input query, then guides the model to conduct multi step reasoning grounded in the subgraph, and finally integrates multiple reasoning paths to produce the final answer. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SGR consistently outperforms strong baselines, indicating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

### [35] [Entropy-Guided Token Dropout: Training Autoregressive Language Models with Limited Domain Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23422)
*Jiapeng Wang,Yiwen Hu,Yanzipeng Gao,Haoyu Wang,Shuo Wang,Hongyu Lu,Jiaxin Mao,Wayne Xin Zhao,Junyi Li,Xiao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses performance degradation in LLMs during multi-epoch training due to overfitting on low-entropy tokens, introduces EntroDrop (entropy-guided token dropout with curriculum schedule) as a regularization method, and shows it outperforms baselines across model scales in data-constrained settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the problem that autoregressive LLMs suffer from performance degradation under repeated data exposure (multi-epoch training) due to an imbalance in learning dynamics: low-entropy tokens are learned quickly and dominate optimization, while generalization on high-entropy tokens deteriorates.

Method: Introduce EntroDrop, an entropy-guided token dropout method which selectively masks low-entropy tokens during training and uses a curriculum schedule to adjust regularization strength based on training progress.

Result: Experiments on models from 0.6B to 8B parameters show EntroDrop consistently outperforms standard regularization baselines and maintains robust performance throughout extended multi-epoch training.

Conclusion: Aligning regularization with token-level learning dynamics is crucial for training LLMs in data-constrained domains; EntroDrop provides a promising pathway for effective LLM adaptation in such settings.

Abstract: As access to high-quality, domain-specific data grows increasingly scarce, multi-epoch training has become a practical strategy for adapting large language models (LLMs). However, autoregressive models often suffer from performance degradation under repeated data exposure, where overfitting leads to a marked decline in model capability. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to an imbalance in learning dynamics: predictable, low-entropy tokens are learned quickly and come to dominate optimization, while the model's ability to generalize on high-entropy tokens deteriorates with continued training. To address this, we introduce EntroDrop, an entropy-guided token dropout method that functions as structured data regularization. EntroDrop selectively masks low-entropy tokens during training and employs a curriculum schedule to adjust regularization strength in alignment with training progress. Experiments across model scales from 0.6B to 8B parameters show that EntroDrop consistently outperforms standard regularization baselines and maintains robust performance throughout extended multi-epoch training. These findings underscore the importance of aligning regularization with token-level learning dynamics when training on limited data. Our approach offers a promising pathway toward more effective adaptation of LLMs in data-constrained domains.

*Yi Zhao,Yongjun Zhu,Donghun Kim,Yuzhuo Wang,Heng Zhang,Chao Lu,Chengzhi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines how gender diversity across leadership and support roles in scientific teams affects their impact, using citation counts from PLOS journals and regression models, finding inverted U-shaped relationships, role-specific optimal compositions, and team size moderation effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior studies on gender diversity's impact on scientific teams are inconsistent and overlook internal role differentiation, which hinders a nuanced understanding of how gender diversity shapes team impact; especially the effect across different roles is poorly understood.

Method: Define scientific teams as coauthors of a paper, measure impact via 5-year citation counts; classify members into leadership/support roles using author contribution statements; analyze over 130k PLOS papers (mostly biomedical) with multivariable regression and threshold regression to examine role-based gender diversity's association with impact and team size moderation.

Result: 1) Gender diversity in both leadership and support groups has an inverted U-shaped relationship with team impact; 2) Teams with all-female leadership and all-male support have higher impact than other types; 3) Leadership gender diversity's effect is negative for small teams but positive (insignificant) for large teams; support gender diversity's effect remains significant positive regardless of size.

Conclusion: Gender diversity's impact on scientific teams depends on role (leadership/support) and team size, highlighting the need to consider role differentiation in diversity research for better team performance.

Abstract: The influence of gender diversity on the success of scientific teams is of great interest to academia. However, prior findings remain inconsistent, and most studies operationalize diversity in aggregate terms, overlooking internal role differentiation. This limitation obscures a more nuanced understanding of how gender diversity shapes team impact. In particular, the effect of gender diversity across different team roles remains poorly understood. To this end, we define a scientific team as all coauthors of a paper and measure team impact through five-year citation counts. Using author contribution statements, we classified members into leadership and support roles. Drawing on more than 130,000 papers from PLOS journals, most of which are in biomedical-related disciplines, we employed multivariable regression to examine the association between gender diversity in these roles and team impact. Furthermore, we apply a threshold regression model to investigate how team size moderates this relationship. The results show that (1) the relationship between gender diversity and team impact follows an inverted U-shape for both leadership and support groups; (2) teams with an all-female leadership group and an all-male support group achieve higher impact than other team types. Interestingly, (3) the effect of leadership-group gender diversity is significantly negative for small teams but becomes positive and statistically insignificant in large teams. In contrast, the estimates for support-group gender diversity remain significant and positive, regardless of team size.

TL;DR: This paper proposes ClinDEF, a dynamic framework for evaluating clinical reasoning in LLMs via simulated diagnostic dialogues, addressing limitations of static benchmarks like limited/contaminated datasets and lack of granular evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM benchmarks for clinical reasoning focus on static question-answering, which poorly represent the dynamic, iterative doctor-patient interaction process of clinical diagnosis; recent dynamic methods suffer from limited/contaminated datasets and lack granular multi-level evaluation.

Method: ClinDEF is a dynamic framework grounded in a disease knowledge graph that generates patient cases and enables multi-turn interactions between an LLM-based doctor and an automated patient agent; its evaluation protocol includes diagnostic accuracy, fine-grained efficiency analysis, and rubric-based diagnostic quality assessment.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that ClinDEF effectively exposes critical clinical reasoning gaps in state-of-the-art LLMs.

Conclusion: ClinDEF provides a more nuanced and clinically meaningful paradigm for evaluating LLM clinical reasoning compared to static benchmarks.

Abstract: Clinical diagnosis begins with doctor-patient interaction, during which physicians iteratively gather information, determine examination and refine differential diagnosis through patients' response. This dynamic clinical-reasoning process is poorly represented by existing LLM benchmarks that focus on static question-answering. To mitigate these gaps, recent methods explore dynamic medical frameworks involving interactive clinical dialogues. Although effective, they often rely on limited, contamination-prone datasets and lack granular, multi-level evaluation. In this work, we propose ClinDEF, a dynamic framework for assessing clinical reasoning in LLMs through simulated diagnostic dialogues. Grounded in a disease knowledge graph, our method dynamically generates patient cases and facilitates multi-turn interactions between an LLM-based doctor and an automated patient agent. Our evaluation protocol goes beyond diagnostic accuracy by incorporating fine-grained efficiency analysis and rubric-based assessment of diagnostic quality. Experiments show that ClinDEF effectively exposes critical clinical reasoning gaps in state-of-the-art LLMs, offering a more nuanced and clinically meaningful evaluation paradigm.

### [38] [Coupling Experts and Routers in Mixture-of-Experts via an Auxiliary Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23447)
*Ang Lv,Jin Ma,Yiyuan Ma,Siyuan Qiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes an expert-router coupling (ERC) loss to address the misalignment between router decisions and expert capabilities in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, improving performance via lightweight constraints on expert activations relative to proxy tokens, with fixed computational cost independent of batch size; experiments on 3B-15B MoE-LLMs show effectiveness and enable tracking of expert specialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE models lack explicit constraints to align router decisions with expert capabilities, limiting performance.

Method: Propose ERC loss: treat each expert's router embedding as a proxy token for assigned tokens; feed perturbed router embeddings through experts to get activations; enforce two constraints—each expert has higher activation for its own proxy than others, and each proxy elicits stronger activation from its corresponding expert than others; ERC loss operates on n² activations (n=number of experts, fixed cost independent of batch size).

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness through pre-training MoE-LLMs ranging from 3B to 15B parameters and extensive analysis on trillions of tokens.

Conclusion: ERC loss is a lightweight auxiliary loss that tightly couples router decisions with expert capabilities, improving MoE model performance, being computationally efficient, and offering flexible control and quantitative tracking of expert specialization during training.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models lack explicit constraints to ensure the router's decisions align well with the experts' capabilities, which ultimately limits model performance. To address this, we propose expert-router coupling (ERC) loss, a lightweight auxiliary loss that tightly couples the router's decisions with expert capabilities. Our approach treats each expert's router embedding as a proxy token for the tokens assigned to that expert, and feeds perturbed router embeddings through the experts to obtain internal activations. The ERC loss enforces two constraints on these activations: (1) Each expert must exhibit higher activation for its own proxy token than for the proxy tokens of any other expert. (2) Each proxy token must elicit stronger activation from its corresponding expert than from any other expert. These constraints jointly ensure that each router embedding faithfully represents its corresponding expert's capability, while each expert specializes in processing the tokens actually routed to it. The ERC loss is computationally efficient, operating only on n^2 activations, where n is the number of experts. This represents a fixed cost independent of batch size, unlike prior coupling methods that scale with the number of tokens (often millions per batch). Through pre-training MoE-LLMs ranging from 3B to 15B parameters and extensive analysis on trillions of tokens, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the ERC loss. Moreover, the ERC loss offers flexible control and quantitative tracking of expert specialization levels during training, providing valuable insights into MoEs.

*Thomas Haschka,Joseph Bakarji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a nested density clustering approach to infer hierarchical semantic trees from text corpora using LLM embeddings, validates it on scientific abstracts, 20 Newsgroups, and IMDB datasets, and discusses applications in scientometrics and topic evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing use of LLM embeddings for semantic similarity storage/retrieval fails to reveal the global hierarchical semantic structure in text corpora, which is needed for data-driven discovery of research areas/subfields without predefined categories.

Method: A nested density clustering approach: start with dense clusters (strong semantic similarity) in LLM embedding space, gradually relax density criteria to merge into diffuse clusters until one root cluster, constructing a hierarchical tree capturing semantic relationships.

Result: The method is robust across domains—validated on scientific abstracts (enables data-driven research area discovery), 20 Newsgroups, and IMDB 50k Movie Reviews datasets.

Conclusion: Nested density trees can reveal semantic structure and evolution in textual datasets, with potential applications in scientometrics and topic evolution.

Abstract: Semantic text classification has undergone significant advances in recent years due to the rise of large language models (LLMs) and their high dimensional embeddings. While LLM-embeddings are frequently used to store and retrieve text by semantic similarity in vector databases, the global structure semantic relationships in text corpora often remains opaque. Herein we propose a nested density clustering approach, to infer hierarchical trees of semantically related texts. The method starts by identifying texts of strong semantic similarity as it searches for dense clusters in LLM embedding space. As the density criterion is gradually relaxed, these dense clusters merge into more diffuse clusters, until the whole dataset is represented by a single cluster -- the root of the tree. By embedding dense clusters into increasingly diffuse ones, we construct a tree structure that captures hierarchical semantic relationships among texts. We outline how this approach can be used to classify textual data for abstracts of scientific abstracts as a case study. This enables the data-driven discovery research areas and their subfields without predefined categories. To evaluate the general applicability of the method, we further apply it to established benchmark datasets such as the 20 Newsgroups and IMDB 50k Movie Reviews, demonstrating its robustness across domains. Finally we discuss possible applications on scientometrics, topic evolution, highlighting how nested density trees can reveal semantic structure and evolution in textual datasets.

*Hadar Miller,Tsvi Kuflik,Moshe Lavee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces ACT, a three-stage algorithm for detecting biblical quotations in Rabbinic literature, which outperforms existing systems with an F1 score of 0.91 and enables new intertextual analysis avenues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing text reuse frameworks that struggle with short, paraphrased, or structurally embedded biblical quotations in Rabbinic literature, and bridge the gap between exhaustive machine detection and human editorial judgment.

Method: ACT is a three-stage algorithm combining a morphology-aware alignment algorithm with a context-sensitive enrichment stage to identify complex citation patterns like 'Wave' and 'Echo' quotations; three configurations (ACT-QE, ACT-2, ACT-3) were evaluated to isolate component contributions.

Result: The full ACT pipeline (ACT-QE) outperforms baselines (Dicta, Passim, Text-Matcher, human-annotated editions) with F1=0.91 (Recall=0.89, Precision=0.94); ACT-2 has higher Recall (0.90) but lower Precision, while ACT-3 balances coverage and specificity.

Conclusion: ACT improves quotation detection, classifies stylistic patterns for genre classification and intertextual analysis, contributes to digital humanities/computational philology, and lays a foundation for broader historical textual analysis applications in morphologically rich traditions like Aggadic literature.

Abstract: This paper presents ACT (Allocate Connections between Texts), a novel three-stage algorithm for the automatic detection of biblical quotations in Rabbinic literature. Unlike existing text reuse frameworks that struggle with short, paraphrased, or structurally embedded quotations, ACT combines a morphology-aware alignment algorithm with a context-sensitive enrichment stage that identifies complex citation patterns such as "Wave" and "Echo" quotations.
  Our approach was evaluated against leading systems, including Dicta, Passim, Text-Matcher, as well as human-annotated critical editions. We further assessed three ACT configurations to isolate the contribution of each component. Results demonstrate that the full ACT pipeline (ACT-QE) outperforms all baselines, achieving an F1 score of 0.91, with superior Recall (0.89) and Precision (0.94). Notably, ACT-2, which lacks stylistic enrichment, achieves higher Recall (0.90) but suffers in Precision, while ACT-3, using longer n-grams, offers a tradeoff between coverage and specificity.
  In addition to improving quotation detection, ACT's ability to classify stylistic patterns across corpora opens new avenues for genre classification and intertextual analysis. This work contributes to digital humanities and computational philology by addressing the methodological gap between exhaustive machine-based detection and human editorial judgment. ACT lays a foundation for broader applications in historical textual analysis, especially in morphologically rich and citation-dense traditions like Aggadic literature.

### [41] [UniHetero: Could Generation Enhance Understanding for Vision-Language-Model at Large Data Scale?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23512)
*Fengjiao Chen,Minhao Jing,Weitao Lu,Yan Feng,Xiaoyu Li,Xuezhi Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores whether visual generation enhances understanding in unified vision-language large models via large-scale pretraining of UniHetero, finding that semantic generation improves understanding, shows better data scaling and utilization, and input embedding autoregression captures details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if generation can enhance understanding in unified vision-language large models on a large data scale, which is under-explored.

Method: Analyze a concise unified model (UniHetero) under large-scale pretraining (>200M samples) and derive key observations.

Result: Three key observations: (1) Generation improves understanding only if generating semantics (not pixels); (2) Generation has superior data scaling trend and higher data utilization; (3) Autoregression on input embedding effectively captures visual details.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the benefits of integrating generation (especially semantic generation) into unified vision-language models for enhanced understanding, better data efficiency, and detail capture.

Abstract: Vision-language large models are moving toward the unification of visual understanding and visual generation tasks. However, whether generation can enhance understanding is still under-explored on large data scale. In this work, we analysis the unified model with a concise structure, UniHetero, under large-scale pretraining (>200M samples). Our key observations are: (1) Generation can improve understanding, but Only if you generate Semantics, Not Pixels. (2) Generation reveals a superior Data Scaling trend and higher Data Utilization. (3) Autoregression on Input Embedding is effective to capture visual details.

### [42] [Single LLM Debate, MoLaCE: Mixture of Latent Concept Experts Against Confirmation Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23518)
*Hazel Kim,Philip Torr*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Mixture of Latent Concept Experts (MoLaCE), a lightweight inference-time framework to reduce input confirmation bias in LLMs and multi-agent debates by mixing experts over latent concepts, outperforming multi-agent debate with less computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address input confirmation bias in LLMs (where models reinforce implied preferred answers instead of exploring alternatives), which is harmful in base models and worse in multi-agent debates due to echo chambers.

Method: Mixture of Latent Concept Experts (MoLaCE), a lightweight inference-time framework that mixes experts instantiated as different activation strengths over latent concepts shaping model responses; it emulates internal debate benefits efficiently and integrates into multi-agent frameworks to diversify perspectives.

Result: MoLaCE consistently reduces confirmation bias, improves robustness, and matches or surpasses multi-agent debate performance while using only a fraction of the computation.

Conclusion: MoLaCE is an effective and efficient solution to mitigate input confirmation bias in LLMs and multi-agent debates.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are highly vulnerable to input confirmation bias. When a prompt implies a preferred answer, models often reinforce that bias rather than explore alternatives. This phenomenon remains underexplored, yet it is already harmful in base models and poses an even greater risk in multi-agent debate, where echo chambers reinforce bias instead of correction. We introduce Mixture of Latent Concept Experts (MoLaCE), a lightweight inference-time framework that addresses confirmation bias by mixing experts instantiated as different activation strengths over latent concepts that shape model responses. Our key insight is that, due to the compositional nature of language, differently phrased prompts reweight latent concepts in prompt-specific ways that affect factual correctness, so no single fixed intervention can be applied universally across inputs. This design enables a single LLM to emulate the benefits of debate internally while remaining computationally efficient and scalable. It can also be integrated into multi-agent debate frameworks to diversify perspectives and reduce correlated errors. We empirically show that it consistently reduces confirmation bias, improves robustness, and matches or surpasses multi-agent debate while requiring only a fraction of the computation.

### [43] [Lie to Me: Knowledge Graphs for Robust Hallucination Self-Detection in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23547)
*Sahil Kale,Antonio Luca Alfeo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a knowledge graph-based approach to enhance hallucination self-detection in LLMs, which converts responses into entity-relation graphs for likelihood estimation, achieving up to 16% accuracy and 20% F1-score improvements over existing methods, and releases a curated dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations (convincing yet false statements) are a major barrier to safe LLM deployment; existing self-detection methods can be improved by leveraging structured knowledge representations like knowledge graphs.

Method: The approach enriches hallucination self-detection by (i) converting LLM responses into knowledge graphs of entities and relations, and (ii) using these graphs to estimate the likelihood of hallucinations. It is model-agnostic and low-cost.

Result: Evaluated on two datasets (one manually curated and released) with GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash, the method achieves up to 16% relative accuracy improvement and 20% F1-score improvement compared to standard self-detection methods and SelfCheckGPT.

Conclusion: Structuring LLM outputs as knowledge graphs helps LLMs better analyze atomic facts even with initial inaccuracies, providing a low-cost, model-agnostic path to safer and more trustworthy language models.

Abstract: Hallucinations, the generation of apparently convincing yet false statements, remain a major barrier to the safe deployment of LLMs. Building on the strong performance of self-detection methods, we examine the use of structured knowledge representations, namely knowledge graphs, to improve hallucination self-detection. Specifically, we propose a simple yet powerful approach that enriches hallucination self-detection by (i) converting LLM responses into knowledge graphs of entities and relations, and (ii) using these graphs to estimate the likelihood that a response contains hallucinations. We evaluate the proposed approach using two widely used LLMs, GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash, across two hallucination detection datasets. To support more reliable future benchmarking, one of these datasets has been manually curated and enhanced and is released as a secondary outcome of this work. Compared to standard self-detection methods and SelfCheckGPT, a state-of-the-art approach, our method achieves up to 16% relative improvement in accuracy and 20% in F1-score. Our results show that LLMs can better analyse atomic facts when they are structured as knowledge graphs, even when initial outputs contain inaccuracies. This low-cost, model-agnostic approach paves the way toward safer and more trustworthy language models.

*Daiki Shiono,Shumpei Miyawaki,Ryota Tanaka,Jun Suzuki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study shows LVLMs lose instruction-following ability after visual instruction tuning, finds including output format instructions in training datasets mitigates this decline, and provides quantitative evidence for these observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem that LVLMs often fail to exhibit the instruction-following ability present in the original LLM after tuning to visual instruction using common datasets, leading to unexpected results when following task instructions.

Method: The study constructed new training datasets highlighting output format specifications, investigated how explicit output format indication during fine-tuning affects LVLMs' instruction-following ability, and conducted quantitative evaluations.

Result: Quantitative evaluation confirmed LVLMs' instruction-following ability declines after fine-tuning with common datasets; LVLMs trained with datasets including output format instructions followed instructions more accurately than those without.

Conclusion: Including samples with output format instructions during (visual) instruction tuning may help mitigate the decline in LVLMs' instruction-following abilities.

Abstract: Following the initial flourishing of large language models (LLMs), there has been a surge in proposed large vision-language models (LVLMs) that integrate LLMs with vision capabilities. However, it has been observed that LVLMs, after tuning to visual instruction using commonly used training datasets, often fail to exhibit the instruction-following ability that was present in the LLM before integration, leading to results in which they do not follow task instructions as expected. This study quantitatively demonstrates that LVLMs' instruction-following ability declines after fine-tuning and analyzes its underlying causes. In particular, we constructed new training datasets highlighting whether the output format is specified. Then, we investigated how explicitly indicating the output format during fine-tuning affects LVLMs' instruction-following ability. Our quantitative evaluation confirmed that LVLMs' instruction-following ability declines after fine-tuning with commonly used datasets. Furthermore, we found that LVLMs trained with datasets, including instructions on output format, tend to follow instructions more accurately than models that do not. These findings suggest that including samples with instructions on output format during (visual) instruction tuning may help mitigate the decline in instruction-following abilities.

*Yu-Xiang Lin,Cheng-Han Chiang,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper identifies 'style amnesia' in spoken language models (SLMs), where they fail to maintain instructed paralinguistic styles (emotion, accent, volume, speed) over multi-turn conversations; evaluates 3 proprietary and 2 open-source SLMs, finds all exhibit this issue, notes SLMs can recall style instructions but not express them consistently, and shows recalling instructions partially mitigates the problem while system message placement worsens it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem that spoken language models (SLMs) cannot maintain instructed paralinguistic speaking styles (emotion, accent, volume, speed) over multi-turn conversations, a phenomenon termed 'style amnesia'.

Method: Evaluate three proprietary and two open-source SLMs on their ability to maintain paralinguistic styles across multi-turn interactions; test if SLMs can recall style instructions later; examine prompting strategies (e.g., instruction placement in system vs user messages).

Result: All evaluated SLMs exhibit style amnesia; SLMs can recall style instructions but fail to express them consistently; explicitly asking to recall instructions partially mitigates style amnesia; SLMs struggle more with style adherence when instructions are in system messages rather than user messages.

Conclusion: Style amnesia is a common issue in SLMs; recalling instructions can partially alleviate it; system message placement for style instructions is less effective than user message placement.

Abstract: In this paper, we show that when spoken language models (SLMs) are instructed to speak in a specific speaking style at the beginning of a multi-turn conversation, they cannot maintain the required speaking styles after several turns of interaction; we refer to this as the style amnesia of SLMs. We focus on paralinguistic speaking styles, including emotion, accent, volume, and speaking speed. We evaluate three proprietary and two open-source SLMs, demonstrating that none of these models can maintain a consistent speaking style when instructed to do so. We further show that when SLMs are asked to recall the style instruction in later turns, they can recall the style instruction, but they fail to express it throughout the conversation. We also show that explicitly asking the model to recall the style instruction can partially mitigate style amnesia. In addition, we examine various prompting strategies and find that SLMs struggle to follow the required style when the instruction is placed in system messages rather than user messages, which contradicts the intended function of system prompts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InfTool is a fully autonomous framework for enabling LLMs to reliably invoke external tools via self-evolving multi-agent synthesis, which generates diverse verified trajectories from raw API specs and uses GRPO with gated rewards for model training, achieving a 258% accuracy improvement on BFCL using only synthetic data without human annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical bottlenecks of existing LLM tool-invocation approaches: expensive human annotation for high-quality trajectories, poor generalization to unseen tools, and quality ceilings from single-model synthesis.

Method: InfTool orchestrates three collaborative agents (User Simulator, Tool-Calling Assistant, MCP Server) to generate diverse verified trajectories spanning single-turn to complex multi-step workflows from raw API specs; it uses a closed loop where synthesized data trains the model via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with gated rewards, and the improved model generates higher-quality data targeting capability gaps iteratively without human intervention.

Result: On the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL), InfTool transforms a base 32B model from 19.8% to 70.9% accuracy (+258%), surpassing models 10x larger and rivaling Claude-Opus, using only synthetic data without human annotation.

Conclusion: InfTool effectively breaks the barriers of existing LLM tool-invocation methods through autonomous multi-agent synthesis and iterative self-improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance with purely synthetic data.

Abstract: Enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to reliably invoke external tools remains a critical bottleneck for autonomous agents. Existing approaches suffer from three fundamental challenges: expensive human annotation for high-quality trajectories, poor generalization to unseen tools, and quality ceilings inherent in single-model synthesis that perpetuate biases and coverage gaps. We introduce InfTool, a fully autonomous framework that breaks these barriers through self-evolving multi-agent synthesis. Given only raw API specifications, InfTool orchestrates three collaborative agents (User Simulator, Tool-Calling Assistant, and MCP Server) to generate diverse, verified trajectories spanning single-turn calls to complex multi-step workflows. The framework establishes a closed loop: synthesized data trains the model via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with gated rewards, the improved model generates higher-quality data targeting capability gaps, and this cycle iterates without human intervention. Experiments on the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) demonstrate that InfTool transforms a base 32B model from 19.8% to 70.9% accuracy (+258%), surpassing models 10x larger and rivaling Claude-Opus, and entirely from synthetic data without human annotation.

Result: 

Conclusion: 

Abstract: The quest for seeking health information has swamped the web with consumers health-related questions. Generally, consumers use overly descriptive and peripheral information to express their medical condition or other healthcare needs, contributing to the challenges of natural language understanding. One way to address this challenge is to summarize the questions and distill the key information of the original question. Recently, large-scale datasets have significantly propelled the development of several summarization tasks, such as multi-document summarization and dialogue summarization. However, a lack of a domain-expert annotated dataset for the consumer healthcare questions summarization task inhibits the development of an efficient summarization system. To address this issue, we introduce a new dataset, CHQ-Sum,m that contains 1507 domain-expert annotated consumer health questions and corresponding summaries. The dataset is derived from the community question answering forum and therefore provides a valuable resource for understanding consumer health-related posts on social media. We benchmark the dataset on multiple state-of-the-art summarization models to show the effectiveness of the dataset

TL;DR: NestBrowse is proposed to enable IS agents to use full browser interaction effectively by decoupling control and exploration via a nested framework, outperforming on deep IS benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current IS agents' tool use is limited to API-level snippet retrieval and URL fetching, missing richer info from real browsing; full browser interaction adds complexity for ReAct-style agents.

Method: Nested Browser-Use Learning (NestBrowse) with a minimal, complete browser-action framework that decouples interaction control from page exploration via a nested structure.

Result: NestBrowse shows clear benefits on challenging deep information-seeking benchmarks, with efficient and flexible performance.

Conclusion: NestBrowse simplifies agentic reasoning while enabling effective deep-web info acquisition, proving beneficial in practice.

Abstract: Information-seeking (IS) agents have achieved strong performance across a range of wide and deep search tasks, yet their tool use remains largely restricted to API-level snippet retrieval and URL-based page fetching, limiting access to the richer information available through real browsing. While full browser interaction could unlock deeper capabilities, its fine-grained control and verbose page content returns introduce substantial complexity for ReAct-style function-calling agents. To bridge this gap, we propose Nested Browser-Use Learning (NestBrowse), which introduces a minimal and complete browser-action framework that decouples interaction control from page exploration through a nested structure. This design simplifies agentic reasoning while enabling effective deep-web information acquisition. Empirical results on challenging deep IS benchmarks demonstrate that NestBrowse offers clear benefits in practice. Further in-depth analyses underscore its efficiency and flexibility.

Motivation: To determine the appropriate amount of context needed when studying the relationship between language model probabilities and cognitive phenomena, specifically whether whole utterances are necessary for observing probabilistic reduction.

Method: Investigate whether whole utterances are necessary to observe probabilistic reduction and test if n-gram representations can serve as cognitive units of planning.

Result: Demonstrate that n-gram representations suffice as cognitive units of planning for observing probabilistic reduction, meaning whole utterances are not necessary.

Conclusion: N-gram representations are adequate cognitive units for the purpose of investigating probabilistic reduction in the context of language model probabilities and cognitive phenomena.

Abstract: The primary research questions of this paper center on defining the amount of context that is necessary and/or appropriate when investigating the relationship between language model probabilities and cognitive phenomena. We investigate whether whole utterances are necessary to observe probabilistic reduction and demonstrate that n-gram representations suffice as cognitive units of planning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates hidden prompt injection attacks on LLM-based academic peer review systems using ~500 real ICML papers, finding significant changes in review outcomes for English, Japanese, Chinese injections but minimal effect for Arabic ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the vulnerability of LLM-based academic peer review systems to document-level hidden prompt injection attacks, which are a critical concern for high-impact LLM workflows.

Method: Construct a dataset of ~500 accepted ICML papers; embed semantically equivalent hidden adversarial prompts in four languages (English, Japanese, Chinese, Arabic); use an LLM to review these injected papers; analyze the impact on review scores and accept/reject decisions.

Result: Hidden prompt injection leads to substantial changes in review scores and accept/reject decisions for English, Japanese, and Chinese injections, but has little to no effect for Arabic injections.

Conclusion: LLM-based reviewing systems are susceptible to document-level prompt injection, with notable variations in vulnerability across different languages.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly considered for use in high-impact workflows, including academic peer review. However, LLMs are vulnerable to document-level hidden prompt injection attacks. In this work, we construct a dataset of approximately 500 real academic papers accepted to ICML and evaluate the effect of embedding hidden adversarial prompts within these documents. Each paper is injected with semantically equivalent instructions in four different languages and reviewed using an LLM. We find that prompt injection induces substantial changes in review scores and accept/reject decisions for English, Japanese, and Chinese injections, while Arabic injections produce little to no effect. These results highlight the susceptibility of LLM-based reviewing systems to document-level prompt injection and reveal notable differences in vulnerability across languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProfASR-Bench is a professional-talk ASR evaluation suite addressing dense terminology, formal register variation, and critical entity error tolerance issues; it supports context-conditioned recognition measurement with entity-aware metrics and slice-wise reporting, revealing a context-utilization gap in current systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ASR benchmarks underplay challenges in professional settings: dense domain terminology, formal register variation, and near-zero tolerance for critical entity errors.

Method: Develop ProfASR-Bench, a suite pairing natural-language prompts (domain cue/speaker profile) with entity-rich utterances; evaluate Whisper and Qwen-Omni under no-context, profile, domain+profile, oracle, and adversarial conditions using conventional ASR metrics plus entity-aware scores and slice-wise reporting.

Result: Lightweight textual context (including oracle prompts) produces little/no change in average WER; adversarial prompts do not reliably degrade performance, indicating a context-utilization gap in current systems.

Conclusion: ProfASR-Bench provides a standardized context ladder, entity- and slice-aware reporting with confidence intervals, and a reproducible testbed for comparing fusion strategies across model families to address the context-utilization gap.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in professional settings faces challenges that existing benchmarks underplay: dense domain terminology, formal register variation, and near-zero tolerance for critical entity errors. We present ProfASR-Bench, a professional-talk evaluation suite for high-stakes applications across finance, medicine, legal, and technology. Each example pairs a natural-language prompt (domain cue and/or speaker profile) with an entity-rich target utterance, enabling controlled measurement of context-conditioned recognition. The corpus supports conventional ASR metrics alongside entity-aware scores and slice-wise reporting by accent and gender. Using representative families Whisper (encoder-decoder ASR) and Qwen-Omni (audio language models) under matched no-context, profile, domain+profile, oracle, and adversarial conditions, we find a consistent pattern: lightweight textual context produces little to no change in average word error rate (WER), even with oracle prompts, and adversarial prompts do not reliably degrade performance. We term this the context-utilization gap (CUG): current systems are nominally promptable yet underuse readily available side information. ProfASR-Bench provides a standardized context ladder, entity- and slice-aware reporting with confidence intervals, and a reproducible testbed for comparing fusion strategies across model families.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method and dataset for fine-tuning language models using feedback-driven improvement chains with preference supervision, which outperforms standard alignment methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance preference tuning efficiency and effectiveness by leveraging structured, revision-based supervision instead of standard A/B ranking or full contrastive rewrites.

Method: Use feedback-driven improvement chains: annotators mark liked/disliked spans with reasons, base model rewrites disliked spans left-to-right to form incremental improvements; construct preference pairs from adjacent steps for alignment.

Result: The approach outperforms direct alignment methods based on standard A/B preference ranking or full contrastive rewrites.

Conclusion: Structured, revision-based supervision leads to more efficient and effective preference tuning for language models.

Abstract: We present a method and dataset for fine-tuning language models with preference supervision using feedback-driven improvement chains. Given a model response, an annotator provides fine-grained feedback by marking ``liked'' and ``disliked'' spans and specifying what they liked or disliked about them. The base model then rewrites the disliked spans accordingly, proceeding from left to right, forming a sequence of incremental improvements. We construct preference pairs for direct alignment from each adjacent step in the chain, enabling the model to learn from localized, targeted edits. We find that our approach outperforms direct alignment methods based on standard A/B preference ranking or full contrastive rewrites, demonstrating that structured, revision-based supervision leads to more efficient and effective preference tuning.

TL;DR: This paper studies multi-turn conversational behavior elicitation for LLM evaluation, categorizes methods into three families, introduces a generalized online method, and shows online methods outperform static ones in finding failure cases with few queries, advocating dynamic benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing behavior elicitation techniques for LLMs are mainly in single-turn settings, but multi-turn conversational evaluation needs effective methods to find failure cases; static benchmarks from existing multi-turn datasets find few/no failures.

Method: 1) Categorize existing behavior elicitation methods into three families based on target model interaction: prior knowledge-only, offline interaction, online interaction. 2) Introduce a generalized multi-turn formulation of the online method, unifying single-turn and multi-turn elicitation. 3) Evaluate all three families on generating multi-turn test cases, analyzing query budget vs success rate trade-off.

Result: Online methods achieve average success rates of 45%,19%,77% over three tasks with just a few thousand queries, while static methods from existing multi-turn benchmarks find few or even no failure cases.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the value of behavior elicitation methods in multi-turn conversation evaluation and calls for the community to shift towards dynamic benchmarks.

Abstract: Identifying specific and often complex behaviors from large language models (LLMs) in conversational settings is crucial for their evaluation. Recent work proposes novel techniques to find natural language prompts that induce specific behaviors from a target model, yet they are mainly studied in single-turn settings. In this work, we study behavior elicitation in the context of multi-turn conversations. We first offer an analytical framework that categorizes existing methods into three families based on their interactions with the target model: those that use only prior knowledge, those that use offline interactions, and those that learn from online interactions. We then introduce a generalized multi-turn formulation of the online method, unifying single-turn and multi-turn elicitation. We evaluate all three families of methods on automatically generating multi-turn test cases. We investigate the efficiency of these approaches by analyzing the trade-off between the query budget, i.e., the number of interactions with the target model, and the success rate, i.e., the discovery rate of behavior-eliciting inputs. We find that online methods can achieve an average success rate of 45/19/77% with just a few thousand queries over three tasks where static methods from existing multi-turn conversation benchmarks find few or even no failure cases. Our work highlights a novel application of behavior elicitation methods in multi-turn conversation evaluation and the need for the community to move towards dynamic benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a pruning framework using adversarial robustness evaluation to prune fragile edges, enhancing GNN defense capability in high-perturbation regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks and spurious connections due to their joint modeling of node features and graph topology, which amplifies perturbations or noise.

Method: A pruning framework that leverages adversarial robustness evaluation to explicitly identify and remove fragile or detrimental components (edges) of the graph, using robustness scores as guidance.

Result: The approach significantly enhances the defense capability of three representative GNN architectures in the high-perturbation regime.

Conclusion: Pruning fragile edges via adversarial robustness evaluation is effective for improving GNN resilience against perturbations and adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a dominant paradigm for learning on graph-structured data, thanks to their ability to jointly exploit node features and relational information encoded in the graph topology. This joint modeling, however, also introduces a critical weakness: perturbations or noise in either the structure or the features can be amplified through message passing, making GNNs highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks and spurious connections. In this work, we introduce a pruning framework that leverages adversarial robustness evaluation to explicitly identify and remove fragile or detrimental components of the graph. By using robustness scores as guidance, our method selectively prunes edges that are most likely to degrade model reliability, thereby yielding cleaner and more resilient graph representations. We instantiate this framework on three representative GNN architectures and conduct extensive experiments on benchmarks. The experimental results show that our approach can significantly enhance the defense capability of GNNs in the high-perturbation regime.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes LANCA, a model using ANM as an inductive bias in a deterministic WAE to address identifiability issues in unsupervised causal representation learning, outperforming baselines on synthetic and photorealistic benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard unsupervised representation learning methods relying on statistical independence fail to capture causal dependencies, and disentangling causal variables from observational data is impossible without supervision, auxiliary signals, or strong inductive biases.

Method: LANCA operationalizes the Additive Noise Model (ANM) as a strong inductive bias using a deterministic Wasserstein Auto-Encoder (WAE) coupled with a differentiable ANM Layer, turning residual independence into an explicit optimization objective.

Result: LANCA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic physics benchmarks (Pendulum, Flow) and photorealistic environments (CANDLE), showing superior robustness to spurious correlations from complex backgrounds.

Conclusion: ANM as an inductive bias in LANCA resolves component-wise indeterminacy (restricting admissible transformations to affine class) and improves unsupervised causal discovery performance on various benchmarks.

Abstract: Unsupervised representation learning seeks to recover latent generative factors, yet standard methods relying on statistical independence often fail to capture causal dependencies. A central challenge is identifiability: as established in disentangled representation learning and nonlinear ICA literature, disentangling causal variables from observational data is impossible without supervision, auxiliary signals, or strong inductive biases. In this work, we propose the Latent Additive Noise Model Causal Autoencoder (LANCA) to operationalize the Additive Noise Model (ANM) as a strong inductive bias for unsupervised discovery. Theoretically, we prove that while the ANM constraint does not guarantee unique identifiability in the general mixing case, it resolves component-wise indeterminacy by restricting the admissible transformations from arbitrary diffeomorphisms to the affine class. Methodologically, arguing that the stochastic encoding inherent to VAEs obscures the structural residuals required for latent causal discovery, LANCA employs a deterministic Wasserstein Auto-Encoder (WAE) coupled with a differentiable ANM Layer. This architecture transforms residual independence from a passive assumption into an explicit optimization objective. Empirically, LANCA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic physics benchmarks (Pendulum, Flow), and on photorealistic environments (CANDLE), where it demonstrates superior robustness to spurious correlations arising from complex background scenes.

Method: TIDES uses clustering to identify heterogeneous traffic patterns, personalized region models, prompt engineering for numerical-to-language embedding, DeepSeek module with cross-domain attention for spatial alignment, and fine-tunes lightweight components (freezing core LLM layers) to reduce overhead.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world cellular datasets show TIDES significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in prediction accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: Integrating spatial awareness into LLM-based predictors is key to scalable, intelligent network management in future 6G systems.

Abstract: The growing demand for intelligent, adaptive resource management in next-generation wireless networks has underscored the importance of accurate and scalable wireless traffic prediction. While recent advancements in deep learning and foundation models such as large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising forecasting capabilities, they largely overlook the spatial dependencies inherent in city-scale traffic dynamics. In this paper, we propose TIDES (Traffic Intelligence with DeepSeek-Enhanced Spatial-temporal prediction), a novel LLM-based framework that captures spatial-temporal correlations for urban wireless traffic prediction. TIDES first identifies heterogeneous traffic patterns across regions through a clustering mechanism and trains personalized models for each region to balance generalization and specialization. To bridge the domain gap between numerical traffic data and language-based models, we introduce a prompt engineering scheme that embeds statistical traffic features as structured inputs. Furthermore, we design a DeepSeek module that enables spatial alignment via cross-domain attention, allowing the LLM to leverage information from spatially related regions. By fine-tuning only lightweight components while freezing core LLM layers, TIDES achieves efficient adaptation to domain-specific patterns without incurring excessive training overhead. Extensive experiments on real-world cellular traffic datasets demonstrate that TIDES significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and robustness. Our results indicate that integrating spatial awareness into LLM-based predictors is the key to unlocking scalable and intelligent network management in future 6G systems.

### [57] [Latent Sculpting for Zero-Shot Generalization: A Manifold Learning Approach to Out-of-Distribution Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22179)
*Rajeeb Thapa Chhetri,Zhixiong Chen,Saurab Thapa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses Generalization Collapse in supervised deep learning for high-dimensional tabular domains by proposing Latent Sculpting, a two-stage framework that improves zero-shot OOD anomaly detection, achieving F1=0.87 on CIC-IDS-2017 and 88.89% detection rate on Infiltration scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve Generalization Collapse where supervised models fail on OOD data due to lack of topological constraints in latent space.

Method: Latent Sculpting: Stage1 uses hybrid 1D-CNN+Transformer Encoder with Dual-Centroid Compactness Loss (DCCL) to form low-entropy hyperspherical clusters of benign data; Stage2 applies Masked Autoregressive Flow (MAF) on pre-structured manifold for exact density estimation.

Result: On CIC-IDS-2017 benchmark, the framework achieved F1-Score of 0.87 on strictly zero-shot anomalies; supervised baselines had F1≈0.30, strongest unsupervised baseline 0.76; 88.89% detection rate on Infiltration scenarios (state-of-the-art supervised models 0.00%).

Conclusion: Explicit manifold sculpting is a prerequisite for robust zero-shot generalization; decoupling structure learning from density estimation provides a scalable path for generalized anomaly detection.

Abstract: A fundamental limitation of supervised deep learning in high-dimensional tabular domains is "Generalization Collapse": models learn precise decision boundaries for known distributions but fail catastrophically when facing Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. We hypothesize that this failure stems from the lack of topological constraints in the latent space, resulting in diffuse manifolds where novel anomalies remain statistically indistinguishable from benign data. To address this, we propose Latent Sculpting, a hierarchical two-stage representation learning framework. Stage 1 utilizes a hybrid 1D-CNN and Transformer Encoder trained with a novel Dual-Centroid Compactness Loss (DCCL) to actively "sculpt" benign traffic into a low-entropy, hyperspherical cluster. Unlike standard contrastive losses that rely on triplet mining, DCCL optimizes global cluster centroids to enforce absolute manifold density. Stage 2 conditions a Masked Autoregressive Flow (MAF) on this pre-structured manifold to learn an exact density estimate. We evaluate this methodology on the rigorous CIC-IDS-2017 benchmark, treating it as a proxy for complex, non-stationary data streams. Empirical results demonstrate that explicit manifold sculpting is a prerequisite for robust zero-shot generalization. While supervised baselines suffered catastrophic performance collapse on unseen distribution shifts (F1 approx 0.30) and the strongest unsupervised baseline achieved only 0.76, our framework achieved an F1-Score of 0.87 on strictly zero-shot anomalies. Notably, we report an 88.89% detection rate on "Infiltration" scenarios--a complex distributional shift where state-of-the-art supervised models achieved 0.00% accuracy. These findings suggest that decoupling structure learning from density estimation provides a scalable path toward generalized anomaly detection.

### [58] [Learning Tennis Strategy Through Curriculum-Based Dueling Double Deep Q-Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22186)
*Vishnu Mohan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework integrating a custom tennis simulation environment with a Dueling Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) trained via curriculum learning to optimize tennis strategy, achieving high win rates but revealing a defensive bias in the learned policy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenging sequential decision-making problem of tennis strategy optimization, which involves hierarchical scoring, stochastic outcomes, long-horizon credit assignment, physical fatigue, and adaptation to opponent skill.

Method: A reinforcement learning framework using a custom tennis simulation environment (modeling scoring, tactical decisions, fatigue, opponent skill) combined with DDQN (decomposing action-value into state-value and advantage) and curriculum learning (progressively increasing opponent difficulty from 0.40 to 0.50).

Result: The trained agent achieves 98-100% win rates against balanced opponents, maintains strong performance against challenging ones; serve efficiency is 63.0-67.5% and return efficiency is52.8-57.1%. Ablation studies show dueling architecture and curriculum learning are necessary for stable convergence, while standard DQN fails. The policy has a defensive bias (prioritizes error avoidance over aggressive play).

Conclusion: Win-rate driven optimization in simplified sports simulations has limitations; reward design is crucial for realistic sports reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Tennis strategy optimization is a challenging sequential decision-making problem involving hierarchical scoring, stochastic outcomes, long-horizon credit assignment, physical fatigue, and adaptation to opponent skill. I present a reinforcement learning framework that integrates a custom tennis simulation environment with a Dueling Double Deep Q-Network(DDQN) trained using curriculum learning. The environment models complete tennis scoring at the level of points, games, and sets, rally-level tactical decisions across ten discrete action categories, symmetric fatigue dynamics, and a continuous opponent skill parameter. The dueling architecture decomposes action-value estimation into state-value and advantage components, while double Q-learning reduces overestimation bias and improves training stability in this long-horizon stochastic domain. Curriculum learning progressively increases opponent difficulty from 0.40 to 0.50, enabling robust skill acquisition without the training collapse observed under fixed opponents. Across extensive evaluations, the trained agent achieves win rates between 98 and 100 percent against balanced opponents and maintains strong performance against more challenging opponents. Serve efficiency ranges from 63.0 to 67.5 percent, and return efficiency ranges from 52.8 to 57.1 percent. Ablation studies demonstrate that both the dueling architecture and curriculum learning are necessary for stable convergence, while a standard DQN baseline fails to learn effective policies. Despite strong performance, tactical analysis reveals a pronounced defensive bias, with the learned policy prioritizing error avoidance and prolonged rallies over aggressive point construction. These results highlight a limitation of win-rate driven optimization in simplified sports simulations and emphasize the importance of reward design for realistic sports reinforcement learning.

*Jiahao Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the spectral bias of CNNs, introduces a visual diagnostic framework and SSR metric to analyze regularizers' frequency selection, finds L2 regularization suppresses high-frequency energy more than baselines, reveals an accuracy-robustness trade-off (L2 is sensitive to Gaussian noise but better at blurred scenarios), and confirms regularization enforces low-frequency inductive bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the underlying physical mechanisms of regularization techniques (like L2 and Dropout) regarding feature frequency selection in deep neural networks.

Method: The paper introduces a Visual Diagnostic Framework to track weight frequency evolution during training, proposes a Spectral Suppression Ratio (SSR) metric to quantify regularizers' low-pass filtering intensity, and addresses aliasing in small kernels via discrete radial profiling; experiments are done on ResNet-18 and CIFAR-10.

Result: L2 regularization suppresses high-frequency energy accumulation by over 3x compared to unregularized baselines; L2 models are sensitive to broadband Gaussian noise but outperform baselines by >6% in blurred scenarios.

Conclusion: Regularization enforces a strong spectral inductive bias towards low-frequency structures in CNNs, providing a signal-processing perspective on generalization.

Abstract: Regularization techniques such as L2 regularization (Weight Decay) and Dropout are fundamental to training deep neural networks, yet their underlying physical mechanisms regarding feature frequency selection remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the Spectral Bias of modern Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We introduce a Visual Diagnostic Framework to track the dynamic evolution of weight frequencies during training and propose a novel metric, the Spectral Suppression Ratio (SSR), to quantify the "low-pass filtering" intensity of different regularizers. By addressing the aliasing issue in small kernels (e.g., 3x3) through discrete radial profiling, our empirical results on ResNet-18 and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that L2 regularization suppresses high-frequency energy accumulation by over 3x compared to unregularized baselines. Furthermore, we reveal a critical Accuracy-Robustness Trade-off: while L2 models are sensitive to broadband Gaussian noise due to over-specialization in low frequencies, they exhibit superior robustness against high-frequency information loss (e.g., low resolution), outperforming baselines by >6% in blurred scenarios. This work provides a signal-processing perspective on generalization, confirming that regularization enforces a strong spectral inductive bias towards low-frequency structures.

### [62] [Emotion-Inspired Learning Signals (EILS): A Homeostatic Framework for Adaptive Autonomous Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22200)
*Dhruv Tiwari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Emotion-Inspired Learning Signals (EILS), a bio-inspired framework replacing static extrinsic rewards with continuous homeostatic appraisal signals (Curiosity, Stress, Confidence) to enhance agent autonomy, sample efficiency, and adaptation in open-ended environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional AI agents rely on static extrinsic rewards, leading to fragility in open-ended real-world settings—they lack internal autonomy, struggle with exploration without dense feedback, fail to adapt to distribution shifts, and need extensive hyperparameter tuning.

Method: The paper introduces EILS, a unified framework modeling emotions as continuous homeostatic appraisal signals (Curiosity, Stress, Confidence) derived from interaction history. These signals dynamically modulate the agent’s optimization landscape: Curiosity regulates entropy to avoid mode collapse, Stress modulates plasticity to overcome inactivity, and Confidence adapts trust regions for stable convergence.

Result: The paper hypothesizes EILS agents will outperform standard baselines in sample efficiency and non-stationary adaptation, but no empirical results are presented in the abstract.

Conclusion: The paper posits that integrating emotion-inspired homeostatic regulation (via EILS) addresses the gap in robust autonomy for AI agents, enabling better performance in open-ended environments.

Abstract: The ruling method in modern Artificial Intelligence spanning from Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to Large Language Models (LLMs) relies on a surge of static, externally defined reward functions. While this "extrinsic maximization" approach has rendered superhuman performance in closed, stationary fields, it produces agents that are fragile in open-ended, real-world environments. Standard agents lack internal autonomy: they struggle to explore without dense feedback, fail to adapt to distribution shifts (non-stationarity), and require extensive manual tuning of static hyperparameters. This paper proposes that the unaddressed factor in robust autonomy is a functional analog to biological emotion, serving as a high-level homeostatic control mechanism. We introduce Emotion-Inspired Learning Signals (EILS), a unified framework that replaces scattered optimization heuristics with a coherent, bio-inspired internal feedback engine. Unlike traditional methods that treat emotions as semantic labels, EILS models them as continuous, homeostatic appraisal signals such as Curiosity, Stress, and Confidence. We formalize these signals as vector-valued internal states derived from interaction history. These states dynamically modulate the agent's optimization landscape in real time: curiosity regulates entropy to prevent mode collapse, stress modulates plasticity to overcome inactivity, and confidence adapts trust regions to stabilize convergence. We hypothesize that this closed-loop homeostatic regulation can enable EILS agents to outperform standard baselines in terms of sample efficiency and non-stationary adaptation.

### [63] [Transformer Reconstructed with Dynamic Value Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22212)
*Xiaowei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Dynamic Value Attention (DVA) method to address the static value limitation in transformer's attention mechanism, replacing multi-head attention with a single head that dynamically assigns values to each query, which eliminates redundant heads and the need for feed-forward networks, resulting in 37.6% faster training time and improved learning capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the transformer's intrinsic limitation of using the same static value for every query in a head, as multi-head attention only partially mitigates this issue and is constrained by complexity.

Method: Implement a single-head Dynamic Value Attention (DVA) that dynamically decides a value for each query, removing the need for redundant heads and the subsequent feed forward network.

Result: The DVA method reduces training time by 37.6% compared to the original transformer while enhancing learning capability.

Conclusion: The proposed Dynamic Value Attention (DVA) effectively addresses the static value limitation of transformers, offering significant efficiency gains and improved performance with a simplified structure.

Abstract: Since transformer was firstly published in 2017, several works have been proposed to optimize it. However, the major structure of transformer remains unchanged, ignoring one of its main intrinsic limitations, which is the same static value is used for every query in a head. Transformer itself tries to solve this problem by implementing multi-head attentions, yet the number of heads is limited by complexity. I propose a method to decide a value for each query dynamically, which could cut down all the redundant heads, keeping only one. Consequently, the following feed forward network could be cut down entirely, as each revised embedding has already fetched enough useful values far beyond the context. As a result, a single-head Dynamic Value Attention (DVA) is all you need in a transformer. According to the experiment, DVA may save 37.6% training time than the original transformer meanwhile increasing the learning capability.

TL;DR: 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 

Method: 

Result: 

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Attention sinks are tokens, often the beginning-of-sequence (BOS) token, that receive disproportionately high attention despite limited semantic relevance. In this work, we identify a class of attention sinks, which we term secondary sinks, that differ fundamentally from the sinks studied in prior works, which we term primary sinks. While prior works have identified that tokens other than BOS can sometimes become sinks, they were found to exhibit properties analogous to the BOS token. Specifically, they emerge at the same layer, persist throughout the network and draw a large amount of attention mass. Whereas, we find the existence of secondary sinks that arise primarily in middle layers and can persist for a variable number of layers, and draw a smaller, but still significant, amount of attention mass. Through extensive experiments across 11 model families, we analyze where these secondary sinks appear, their properties, how they are formed, and their impact on the attention mechanism. Specifically, we show that: (1) these sinks are formed by specific middle-layer MLP modules; these MLPs map token representations to vectors that align with the direction of the primary sink of that layer. (2) The $\ell_2$-norm of these vectors determines the sink score of the secondary sink, and also the number of layers it lasts for, thereby leading to different impacts on the attention mechanisms accordingly. (3) The primary sink weakens in middle layers, coinciding with the emergence of secondary sinks. We observe that in larger-scale models, the location and lifetime of the sinks, together referred to as sink levels, appear in a more deterministic and frequent manner. Specifically, we identify three sink levels in QwQ-32B and six levels in Qwen3-14B.

### [65] [Interpretable and Adaptive Node Classification on Heterophilic Graphs via Combinatorial Scoring and Hybrid Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22221)
*Soroush Vahidi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an interpretable, adaptive framework for semi-supervised node classification under heterophily, using combinatorial inference with a greedy procedure integrating multiple components, plus a validation-gated hybrid strategy with a lightweight neural model, achieving competitive performance on benchmarks while being interpretable, tunable, and efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs perform well on homophilic graphs but struggle under heterophily where adjacent nodes often belong to different classes.

Method: An interpretable and adaptive framework based on explicit combinatorial inference: label assignment via a confidence-ordered greedy procedure using an additive scoring function integrating class priors, neighborhood statistics, feature similarity, and training-derived label-label compatibility; a validation-gated hybrid strategy that optionally injects combinatorial predictions as priors into a lightweight neural model only when it improves validation performance.

Result: Experiments on heterophilic and transitional benchmarks show competitive performance with modern GNNs, along with advantages in interpretability, tunability, and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively adapts between homophilic and heterophilic regimes, offers interpretability (via transparent hyperparameters and optional neural refinement only when needed), and maintains competitive performance with efficiency.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) achieve strong performance on homophilic graphs but often struggle under heterophily, where adjacent nodes frequently belong to different classes. We propose an interpretable and adaptive framework for semi-supervised node classification based on explicit combinatorial inference rather than deep message passing. Our method assigns labels using a confidence-ordered greedy procedure driven by an additive scoring function that integrates class priors, neighborhood statistics, feature similarity, and training-derived label-label compatibility. A small set of transparent hyperparameters controls the relative influence of these components, enabling smooth adaptation between homophilic and heterophilic regimes.
  We further introduce a validation-gated hybrid strategy in which combinatorial predictions are optionally injected as priors into a lightweight neural model. Hybrid refinement is applied only when it improves validation performance, preserving interpretability when neuralization is unnecessary. All adaptation signals are computed strictly from training data, ensuring a leakage-free evaluation protocol. Experiments on heterophilic and transitional benchmarks demonstrate competitive performance with modern GNNs while offering advantages in interpretability, tunability, and computational efficiency.

### [66] [Müntz-Szász Networks: Neural Architectures with Learnable Power-Law Bases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22222)
*Gnankan Landry Regis N'guessan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Müntz-Szász Networks (MSN), which use learnable fractional power bases instead of fixed activations to better approximate singular/fractional power functions, outperforming MLPs and PINNs on relevant tasks with fewer parameters and interpretable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed activation functions (ReLU, tanh, sigmoid) in standard neural networks are poorly suited for approximating functions with singular or fractional power behavior, which are common in physics (boundary layers, fracture mechanics, corner singularities).

Method: MSN replaces fixed activations with learnable fractional power bases: each edge computes φ(x) = sum(a_k |x|^μ_k) + sum(b_k sign(x)|x|^λ_k), where exponents {μ_k, λ_k} are learned with coefficients. The architecture is guided by the Müntz-Szász theorem for universal approximation.

Result: 1) For |x|^α functions: MSN achieves O(|μ-α|²) error with one learned exponent vs MLPs needing O(ε⁻¹/α) neurons for similar accuracy. 2) Supervised regression on singular targets: MSN has 5-8x lower error than MLPs with 10x fewer parameters.3) PINN benchmarks (singular ODE, stiff boundary layers): MSN gives3-6x improvement and learns interpretable exponents matching known solution structures.

Conclusion: Theory-guided architectural design (like MSN using Müntz-Szász bases) can lead to significant improvements for scientifically motivated function classes (singular/fractional power functions), outperforming standard models in accuracy and parameter efficiency while providing interpretability.

Abstract: Standard neural network architectures employ fixed activation functions (ReLU, tanh, sigmoid) that are poorly suited for approximating functions with singular or fractional power behavior, a structure that arises ubiquitously in physics, including boundary layers, fracture mechanics, and corner singularities. We introduce Müntz-Szász Networks (MSN), a novel architecture that replaces fixed smooth activations with learnable fractional power bases grounded in classical approximation theory. Each MSN edge computes $φ(x) = \sum_k a_k |x|^{μ_k} + \sum_k b_k \mathrm{sign}(x)|x|^{λ_k}$, where the exponents $\{μ_k, λ_k\}$ are learned alongside the coefficients. We prove that MSN inherits universal approximation from the Müntz-Szász theorem and establish novel approximation rates: for functions of the form $|x|^α$, MSN achieves error $\mathcal{O}(|μ- α|^2)$ with a single learned exponent, whereas standard MLPs require $\mathcal{O}(ε^{-1/α})$ neurons for comparable accuracy. On supervised regression with singular target functions, MSN achieves 5-8x lower error than MLPs with 10x fewer parameters. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a particularly demanding application for singular function approximation; on PINN benchmarks including a singular ODE and stiff boundary-layer problems, MSN achieves 3-6x improvement while learning interpretable exponents that match the known solution structure. Our results demonstrate that theory-guided architectural design can yield dramatic improvements for scientifically-motivated function classes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional network traffic analysis systems (rule-based or ML-driven) have high false positives and lack interpretability, limiting analyst trust.

Method: ReGAIN uses traffic summarization→embedding into multi-collection vector DB→hierarchical retrieval pipeline (metadata filtering, MMR sampling, two-stage cross-encoder reranking, abstention mechanism) to ground LLM responses with evidence.

Result: Evaluated on ICMP ping flood and TCP SYN flood traces, ReGAIN achieves 95.95%-98.82% accuracy, outperforms rule-based, classical ML, and deep learning baselines, and provides explainable responses validated by ground truth and human experts.

Conclusion: ReGAIN effectively addresses limitations of traditional network traffic analysis by offering high accuracy and unique explainability through trustworthy, verifiable responses.

Abstract: Modern networks generate vast, heterogeneous traffic that must be continuously analyzed for security and performance. Traditional network traffic analysis systems, whether rule-based or machine learning-driven, often suffer from high false positives and lack interpretability, limiting analyst trust. In this paper, we present ReGAIN, a multi-stage framework that combines traffic summarization, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning for transparent and accurate network traffic analysis. ReGAIN creates natural-language summaries from network traffic, embeds them into a multi-collection vector database, and utilizes a hierarchical retrieval pipeline to ground LLM responses with evidence citations. The pipeline features metadata-based filtering, MMR sampling, a two-stage cross-encoder reranking mechanism, and an abstention mechanism to reduce hallucinations and ensure grounded reasoning. Evaluated on ICMP ping flood and TCP SYN flood traces from the real-world traffic dataset, it demonstrates robust performance, achieving accuracy between 95.95% and 98.82% across different attack types and evaluation benchmarks. These results are validated against two complementary sources: dataset ground truth and human expert assessments. ReGAIN also outperforms rule-based, classical ML, and deep learning baselines while providing unique explainability through trustworthy, verifiable responses.

Conclusion: DiRL and DiPO effectively enhance dLLMs' performance on complex reasoning tasks like mathematics by resolving key post-training challenges.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (dLLMs) have emerged as promising alternatives to Auto-Regressive (AR) models. While recent efforts have validated their pre-training potential and accelerated inference speeds, the post-training landscape for dLLMs remains underdeveloped. Existing methods suffer from computational inefficiency and objective mismatches between training and inference, severely limiting performance on complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics. To address this, we introduce DiRL, an efficient post-training framework that tightly integrates FlexAttention-accelerated blockwise training with LMDeploy-optimized inference. This architecture enables a streamlined online model update loop, facilitating efficient two-stage post-training (Supervised Fine-Tuning followed by Reinforcement Learning). Building on this framework, we propose DiPO, the first unbiased Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) implementation tailored for dLLMs. We validate our approach by training DiRL-8B-Instruct on high-quality math data. Our model achieves state-of-the-art math performance among dLLMs and surpasses comparable models in the Qwen2.5 series on several benchmarks.

### [69] [Masking Teacher and Reinforcing Student for Distilling Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22238)
*Byung-Kwan Lee,Yu-Chiang Frank Wang,Ryo Hachiuma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Masters, a mask-progressive RL distillation framework to address the challenge of distilling knowledge from large VLMs to small ones, using masked teacher weights and offline RL with dual rewards for stable and efficient learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large VLMs are impractical for mobile/edge devices, and distilling from large to small VLMs is challenging due to size gaps causing unstable learning and degraded performance.

Method: Masters uses mask-progressive RL: first masks non-dominant teacher weights, then progressively restores capacity; integrates offline RL with accuracy and distillation rewards using pre-generated responses from masked teachers.

Result: The framework enables small students to achieve strong performance without the computationally expensive think-answer process, via smooth and stable learning from the teacher.

Conclusion: Masters effectively addresses the knowledge distillation gap between large and small VLMs, providing an efficient way to deploy compact VLMs with strong performance.

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) have recently achieved remarkable multimodal understanding, but their massive size makes them impractical for deployment on mobile or edge devices. This raises the need for compact yet capable VLMs that can efficiently learn from powerful large teachers. However, distilling knowledge from a large teacher to a small student remains challenging due to their large size gap: the student often fails to reproduce the teacher's complex, high-dimensional representations, leading to unstable learning and degraded performance. To address this, we propose Masters (Masking Teacher and Reinforcing Student), a mask-progressive reinforcement learning (RL) distillation framework. Masters first masks non-dominant weights of the teacher to reduce unnecessary complexity, then progressively restores the teacher by gradually increasing its capacity during training. This strategy allows the student to learn richer representations from the teacher in a smooth and stable manner. To further refine knowledge transfer, Masters integrates an offline RL stage with two complementary rewards: an accuracy reward that measures the correctness of the generated responses, and a distillation reward that quantifies the ease of transferring responses from teacher to student. Unlike online think-answer RL paradigms that are computationally expensive and generate lengthy responses, our offline RL leverages pre-generated responses from masked teachers. These provide rich yet efficient guidance, enabling students to achieve strong performance without requiring the think-answer process.

### [70] [EvoXplain: When Machine Learning Models Agree on Predictions but Disagree on Why -- Measuring Mechanistic Multiplicity Across Training Runs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22240)
*Chama Bensmail*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces EvoXplain, a diagnostic framework to measure explanation stability across repeated model training, finding high-accuracy models often have multimodal explanations even without hyperparameter changes, reframing interpretability as a class property rather than single model property.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked question: when two high-accuracy models use the same data, do they rely on the same internal logic or different mechanisms?

Method: EvoXplain treats explanations as samples from the stochastic optimization process (without aggregating predictions/ensembles) and checks if they form coherent explanations or distinct modes; evaluated on Breast Cancer and COMPAS datasets with Logistic Regression and Random Forests.

Result: All models achieved high accuracy but explanations frequently showed clear multimodality; even stable models like Logistic Regression produced multiple well-separated explanatory basins under repeated training on same data split, not due to hyperparameter variation or performance trade-offs.

Conclusion: EvoXplain makes explanatory instability visible/quantifiable, revealing when single/averaged explanations obscure multiple underlying mechanisms; reframes interpretability as a property of model class under repeated instantiation instead of single trained model.

Abstract: Machine learning models are primarily judged by predictive performance, especially in applied settings. Once a model reaches high accuracy, its explanation is often assumed to be correct and trustworthy. However, this assumption raises an overlooked question: when two models achieve high accuracy, do they rely on the same internal logic, or do they reach the same outcome via different -- and potentially competing -- mechanisms? We introduce EvoXplain, a diagnostic framework that measures the stability of model explanations across repeated training. Rather than analysing a single trained model, EvoXplain treats explanations as samples drawn from the stochastic optimisation process itself -- without aggregating predictions or constructing ensembles -- and examines whether these samples form a single coherent explanation or separate into multiple, distinct explanatory modes. We evaluate EvoXplain on the Breast Cancer and COMPAS datasets using two widely deployed model classes: Logistic Regression and Random Forests. Although all models achieve high predictive accuracy, their explanations frequently exhibit clear multimodality. Even models commonly assumed to be stable, such as Logistic Regression, can produce multiple well-separated explanatory basins under repeated training on the same data split. These differences are not explained by hyperparameter variation or simple performance trade-offs. EvoXplain does not attempt to select a 'correct' explanation. Instead, it makes explanatory instability visible and quantifiable, revealing when single-instance or averaged explanations obscure the existence of multiple underlying mechanisms. More broadly, EvoXplain reframes interpretability as a property of a model class under repeated instantiation, rather than of any single trained model.

*Abdul Malik Al Mardhouf Al Saadi,Amrita Basak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a cross-dataset knowledge transfer model based on meta-learning (MAML and Reptile) to predict bead geometry in L-DED, addressing data scarcity/heterogeneity. It uses multi-source datasets and shows meta-models outperform conventional networks in few-shot adaptation and generalization across powder/wire/hybrid processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate bead geometry prediction in L-DED is hindered by scarcity and heterogeneity of experimental datasets from different materials, machine configurations, and process parameters.

Method: A cross-dataset knowledge transfer framework using two gradient-based meta-learning algorithms: Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) and Reptile. The framework uses multiple datasets from literature and in-house experiments, evaluated across powder-fed, wire-fed, and hybrid wire-powder L-DED processes.

Result: Meta-learning models (MAML and Reptile) achieve accurate bead height predictions on unseen tasks with 3-9 training examples, outperforming conventional feedforward networks. They show strong generalization: R-squared up to ~0.9, mean absolute errors 0.03-0.08 mm across heterogeneous L-DED settings.

Conclusion: Meta-learning enables effective knowledge transfer across heterogeneous L-DED conditions, solving data scarcity/heterogeneity issues for bead geometry prediction.

Abstract: Accurate bead geometry prediction in laser-directed energy deposition (L-DED) is often hindered by the scarcity and heterogeneity of experimental datasets collected under different materials, machine configurations, and process parameters. To address this challenge, a cross-dataset knowledge transfer model based on meta-learning for predicting deposited track geometry in L-DED is proposed. Specifically, two gradient-based meta-learning algorithms, i.e., Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) and Reptile, are investigated to enable rapid adaptation to new deposition conditions with limited data. The proposed framework is performed using multiple experimental datasets compiled from peer-reviewed literature and in-house experiments and evaluated across powder-fed, wire-fed, and hybrid wire-powder L-DED processes. Results show that both MAML and Reptile achieve accurate bead height predictions on unseen target tasks using as few as three to nine training examples, consistently outperforming conventional feedforward neural networks trained under comparable data constraints. Across multiple target tasks representing different printing conditions, the meta-learning models achieve strong generalization performance, with R-squared values reaching up to approximately 0.9 and mean absolute errors between 0.03-0.08 mm, demonstrating effective knowledge transfer across heterogeneous L-DED settings.

*Shaurya Gaur,Michel Vitale,Alessa Hering,Johan Kwisthout,Colin Jacobs,Lena Philipp,Fennie van der Graaf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study evaluates performance disparities and fairness of three lung cancer risk estimation models (Sybil, Venkadesh21, PanCan2b) across demographic subgroups using the JustEFAB framework, finding significant biases in Sybil (women vs men AUROC difference) and Venkadesh21 (Black vs White sensitivity difference) that aren't explained by clinical confounders, emphasizing the need for improved fairness monitoring in lung cancer screening models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Widespread use of LDCT for lung cancer screening may strain radiology workforce, and AI models show potential for risk estimation, but their performance across diverse demographic groups (a key fairness concern) remains unclear.

Method: The study uses the JustEFAB framework to evaluate performance disparities of two deep learning models (Sybil, Venkadesh21) trained on NLST data and the PanCan2b logistic regression model; it assesses AUROC, sensitivity, specificity across demographic subgroups and explores confounding from clinical risk factors.

Result: Sybil has statistically significant higher AUROC for women (0.88) vs men (0.81, p<.001); Venkadesh21 at 90% specificity has lower sensitivity for Black (0.39) vs White (0.69) participants; these differences aren't explained by available clinical confounders, classifying as unfair biases per JustEFAB.

Conclusion: Improving and monitoring model performance across underrepresented subgroups and further research on algorithmic fairness are crucial for lung cancer screening models.

Abstract: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in adults worldwide. Screening high-risk individuals with annual low-dose CT (LDCT) can support earlier detection and reduce deaths, but widespread implementation may strain the already limited radiology workforce. AI models have shown potential in estimating lung cancer risk from LDCT scans. However, high-risk populations for lung cancer are diverse, and these models' performance across demographic groups remains an open question. In this study, we drew on the considerations on confounding factors and ethically significant biases outlined in the JustEFAB framework to evaluate potential performance disparities and fairness in two deep learning risk estimation models for lung cancer screening: the Sybil lung cancer risk model and the Venkadesh21 nodule risk estimator. We also examined disparities in the PanCan2b logistic regression model recommended in the British Thoracic Society nodule management guideline. Both deep learning models were trained on data from the US-based National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), and assessed on a held-out NLST validation set. We evaluated AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity across demographic subgroups, and explored potential confounding from clinical risk factors. We observed a statistically significant AUROC difference in Sybil's performance between women (0.88, 95% CI: 0.86, 0.90) and men (0.81, 95% CI: 0.78, 0.84, p < .001). At 90% specificity, Venkadesh21 showed lower sensitivity for Black (0.39, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.59) than White participants (0.69, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.73). These differences were not explained by available clinical confounders and thus may be classified as unfair biases according to JustEFAB. Our findings highlight the importance of improving and monitoring model performance across underrepresented subgroups, and further research on algorithmic fairness, in lung cancer screening.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study uses neural networks and transfer learning models (including TabPFN, TabNet, FT-Transformer) to predict mycotoxin contamination in Irish oat crops as a multi-response task, finding TabPFN performs best and identifying key predictors like pre-harvest weather and seed moisture content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accurately predict mycotoxin levels in Irish oat crops to support early interventions and reduce economic losses due to mycotoxin contamination's risks to cereal quality, food safety, and agricultural productivity.

Method: Evaluated five modelling approaches: baseline MLP, pre-trained MLP, and three transfer learning models (TabPFN, TabNet, FT-Transformer) using a dataset of Irish oat samples with environmental, agronomic, and geographical predictors; assessed performance via regression (RMSE, R²) and classification (AUC, F1) metrics, plus permutation-based variable importance analysis.

Result: TabPFN provided the overall best performance, followed by the baseline MLP; weather history in the 90-day pre-harvest period and seed moisture content were the most influential predictors.

Conclusion: Transfer learning models (especially TabPFN) are effective for predicting mycotoxin contamination in oats, with pre-harvest weather and seed moisture being critical factors for prediction.

Abstract: Mycotoxin contamination poses a significant risk to cereal crop quality, food safety, and agricultural productivity. Accurate prediction of mycotoxin levels can support early intervention strategies and reduce economic losses. This study investigates the use of neural networks and transfer learning models to predict mycotoxin contamination in Irish oat crops as a multi-response prediction task. Our dataset comprises oat samples collected in Ireland, containing a mix of environmental, agronomic, and geographical predictors. Five modelling approaches were evaluated: a baseline multilayer perceptron (MLP), an MLP with pre-training, and three transfer learning models; TabPFN, TabNet, and FT-Transformer. Model performance was evaluated using regression (RMSE, $R^2$) and classification (AUC, F1) metrics, with results reported per toxin and on average. Additionally, permutation-based variable importance analysis was conducted to identify the most influential predictors across both prediction tasks. The transfer learning approach TabPFN provided the overall best performance, followed by the baseline MLP. Our variable importance analysis revealed that weather history patterns in the 90-day pre-harvest period were the most important predictors, alongside seed moisture content.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces linear probes trained with Brier score loss to get calibrated uncertainty estimates from reasoning judges' hidden states, which is efficient and well-calibrated compared to existing methods, with benefits for safety-critical deployments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To obtain well-calibrated uncertainty estimates efficiently for LLM-based judges in production, as existing techniques are either poorly calibrated or computationally expensive.

Method: Using linear probes trained with a Brier score-based loss on reasoning judges' hidden states, requiring no additional model training.

Result: Probes achieve superior calibration vs existing methods with ~10x computational savings, generalize to unseen domains, have higher accuracy on high-confidence predictions; but produce conservative estimates underperforming on easier datasets.

Conclusion: Interpretability-based uncertainty estimation via linear probes is a practical, scalable plug-and-play solution for LLM judges in production.

Abstract: As LLM-based judges become integral to industry applications, obtaining well-calibrated uncertainty estimates efficiently has become critical for production deployment. However, existing techniques, such as verbalized confidence and multi-generation methods, are often either poorly calibrated or computationally expensive. We introduce linear probes trained with a Brier score-based loss to provide calibrated uncertainty estimates from reasoning judges' hidden states, requiring no additional model training. We evaluate our approach on both objective tasks (reasoning, mathematics, factuality, coding) and subjective human preference judgments. Our results demonstrate that probes achieve superior calibration compared to existing methods with $\approx10$x computational savings, generalize robustly to unseen evaluation domains, and deliver higher accuracy on high-confidence predictions. However, probes produce conservative estimates that underperform on easier datasets but may benefit safety-critical deployments prioritizing low false-positive rates. Overall, our work demonstrates that interpretability-based uncertainty estimation provides a practical and scalable plug-and-play solution for LLM judges in production.

### [75] [The Affine Divergence: Aligning Activation Updates Beyond Normalisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22247)
*George Bird*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper identifies a mismatch between ideal and effective activation updates in gradient descent, reframes normalization's role from first principles, proposes alternative normalization methods (including PatchNorm) that outperform conventional ones without scale-invariance, and argues for decomposing normalizers into activation-function-like maps with parameterized scaling to prioritize representations during optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the systematic mismatch between mathematically ideal and effective activation updates in gradient descent, where activations (closer to loss and sample-dependent) do not take optimal steepest-descent steps and exhibit non-ideal sample-wise scaling across layers; also to provide a fresh conceptual reframe of normalization and explore alternative solutions.

Method: The paper analyzes the scaling issues of activation updates across affine, convolutional, and attention layers; derives normalization from first principles (trivially correcting the mismatch incidentally); proposes alternative normalization methods (including PatchNorm, a compositionally inseparable normalizer for convolution) distinct from modern scale-invariant normalizations; and decomposes normalizers into activation-function-like maps with parameterized scaling.

Result: The proposed alternative normalization solutions (e.g., PatchNorm) are empirically successful, outperforming conventional normalizers across several tests. The theoretical framework adds to and counters parts of existing normalization discussions.

Conclusion: Normalization can be reframed from first principles to correct activation update mismatches; alternative non-scale-invariant normalizers are effective; normalizers should be decomposed into activation-function-like maps with parameterized scaling to prioritize representations, offering a principled approach yielding validated new functions and questioning the affine + nonlinear model creation paradigm.

Abstract: A systematic mismatch exists between mathematically ideal and effective activation updates during gradient descent. As intended, parameters update in their direction of steepest descent. However, activations are argued to constitute a more directly impactful quantity to prioritise in optimisation, as they are closer to the loss in the computational graph and carry sample-dependent information through the network. Yet their propagated updates do not take the optimal steepest-descent step. These quantities exhibit non-ideal sample-wise scaling across affine, convolutional, and attention layers. Solutions to correct for this are trivial and, entirely incidentally, derive normalisation from first principles despite motivational independence. Consequently, such considerations offer a fresh and conceptual reframe of normalisation's action, with auxiliary experiments bolstering this mechanistically. Moreover, this analysis makes clear a second possibility: a solution that is functionally distinct from modern normalisations, without scale-invariance, yet remains empirically successful, outperforming conventional normalisers across several tests. This is presented as an alternative to the affine map. This generalises to convolution via a new functional form, "PatchNorm", a compositionally inseparable normaliser. Together, these provide an alternative mechanistic framework that adds to, and counters some of, the discussion of normalisation. Further, it is argued that normalisers are better decomposed into activation-function-like maps with parameterised scaling, thereby aiding the prioritisation of representations during optimisation. Overall, this constitutes a theoretical-principled approach that yields several new functions that are empirically validated and raises questions about the affine + nonlinear approach to model creation.

*Rohit Pandey,Rohan Pandey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a simulation-based amortized inference approach using a neural network trained on synthetic flight data to predict aerodynamic parameters (drag coefficient and thrust correction factor) from apogee measurements, achieving better apogee prediction accuracy than OpenRocket on real flights without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate model rocket flight performance prediction needs aerodynamic parameters hard to measure directly; traditional methods rely on CFD or empirical correlations, while data-driven methods require expensive real flight data.

Method: A simulation-based amortized inference approach: train a neural network on synthetic flight data from a physics simulator to invert the forward physics model, predicting drag coefficient and thrust correction factor from a single apogee measurement plus motor and configuration features.

Result: Trained on 10k synthetic flights, evaluated on 8 real flights: mean absolute error of 12.3m in apogee prediction; outperforms OpenRocket baseline; shows systematic positive bias in predictions.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates promising sim-to-real transfer with zero real training examples, reduces apogee prediction error compared to OpenRocket, and the implementation is publicly available for the amateur rocketry community.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of model rocket flight performance requires estimating aerodynamic parameters that are difficult to measure directly. Traditional approaches rely on computational fluid dynamics or empirical correlations, while data-driven methods require extensive real flight data that is expensive and time-consuming to collect. We present a simulation-based amortized inference approach that trains a neural network on synthetic flight data generated from a physics simulator, then applies the learned model to real flights without any fine-tuning. Our method learns to invert the forward physics model, directly predicting drag coefficient and thrust correction factor from a single apogee measurement combined with motor and configuration features. In this proof-of-concept study, we train on 10,000 synthetic flights and evaluate on 8 real flights, achieving a mean absolute error of 12.3 m in apogee prediction - demonstrating promising sim-to-real transfer with zero real training examples. Analysis reveals a systematic positive bias in predictions, providing quantitative insight into the gap between idealized physics and real-world flight conditions. We additionally compare against OpenRocket baseline predictions, showing that our learned approach reduces apogee prediction error. Our implementation is publicly available to support reproducibility and adoption in the amateur rocketry community.

### [77] [Temporal Visual Semantics-Induced Human Motion Understanding with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22249)
*Zheng Xing,Weibing Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a temporal vision semantics (TVS)-integrated subspace clustering approach for unsupervised human motion segmentation, which leverages large language model (LLM) to extract textual motion info from consecutive frames and incorporates temporal regularizers and feedback optimization to outperform state-of-the-art methods on four benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional subspace clustering techniques for unsupervised human motion segmentation (HMS) overlook the role of temporal semantic exploration, limiting their performance.

Method: The method extracts textual motion information from consecutive frames via LLM to determine if they depict the same motion, learns temporal neighboring info from LLM responses, then integrates TVS into subspace clustering with a temporal regularizer (inducing similar subspace embeddings for temporal neighbors) and a temporal constraint (grouping frames with temporal neighbors) in segmentation. A feedback framework optimizes subspace embedding continuously based on segmentation output.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on four benchmark human motion datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating temporal vision semantics derived from LLM into subspace clustering improves unsupervised human motion segmentation performance.

Abstract: Unsupervised human motion segmentation (HMS) can be effectively achieved using subspace clustering techniques. However, traditional methods overlook the role of temporal semantic exploration in HMS. This paper explores the use of temporal vision semantics (TVS) derived from human motion sequences, leveraging the image-to-text capabilities of a large language model (LLM) to enhance subspace clustering performance. The core idea is to extract textual motion information from consecutive frames via LLM and incorporate this learned information into the subspace clustering framework. The primary challenge lies in learning TVS from human motion sequences using LLM and integrating this information into subspace clustering. To address this, we determine whether consecutive frames depict the same motion by querying the LLM and subsequently learn temporal neighboring information based on its response. We then develop a TVS-integrated subspace clustering approach, incorporating subspace embedding with a temporal regularizer that induces each frame to share similar subspace embeddings with its temporal neighbors. Additionally, segmentation is performed based on subspace embedding with a temporal constraint that induces the grouping of each frame with its temporal neighbors. We also introduce a feedback-enabled framework that continuously optimizes subspace embedding based on the segmentation output. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on four benchmark human motion datasets.

TL;DR: This paper constructs a merged biomedical graph integrating PrimeKG++ and LINCS L1000 nodes with foundation model embeddings, trains a GAT to predict delta expression profiles of landmark genes for drug-cell pairs, outperforming MLP baselines and showing KG edges enhance prediction, enabling mechanistic drug modeling beyond binary tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap that prior deep learning frameworks on biomedical knowledge graphs (BKGs) focus on link prediction or binary drug-disease association rather than gene perturbation tasks which reveal mechanistic transcriptomic effects of drugs.

Method: Construct a merged heterogeneous biomedical graph integrating PrimeKG++ (augmented PrimeKG with rich node embeddings) and LINCS L1000 drug/cell line nodes (initialized with MolFormerXL and BioBERT embeddings); train a graph attention network (GAT) with a downstream prediction head to learn delta expression profiles of over 978 landmark genes for drug-cell pairs.

Result: The framework outperforms MLP baselines for differentially expressed genes (DEG) under scaffold and random splits; ablation experiments (edge shuffling, node feature randomization) show edges from biomedical KGs enhance perturbation-level prediction.

Conclusion: The framework provides a path toward mechanistic drug modeling by moving beyond binary drug-disease association tasks to granular transcriptional effects of therapeutic interventions.

Abstract: Understanding how small molecules perturb gene expression is essential for uncovering drug mechanisms, predicting off-target effects, and identifying repurposing opportunities. While prior deep learning frameworks have integrated multimodal embeddings into biomedical knowledge graphs (BKGs) and further improved these representations through graph neural network message-passing paradigms, these models have been applied to tasks such as link prediction and binary drug-disease association, rather than the task of gene perturbation, which may unveil more about mechanistic transcriptomic effects. To address this gap, we construct a merged biomedical graph that integrates (i) PrimeKG++, an augmentation of PrimeKG containing semantically rich embeddings for nodes with (ii) LINCS L1000 drug and cell line nodes, initialized with multimodal embeddings from foundation models such as MolFormerXL and BioBERT. Using this heterogeneous graph, we train a graph attention network (GAT) with a downstream prediction head that learns the delta expression profile of over 978 landmark genes for a given drug-cell pair. Our results show that our framework outperforms MLP baselines for differentially expressed genes (DEG) -- which predict the delta expression given a concatenated embedding of drug features, target features, and baseline cell expression -- under the scaffold and random splits. Ablation experiments with edge shuffling and node feature randomization further demonstrate that the edges provided by biomedical KGs enhance perturbation-level prediction. More broadly, our framework provides a path toward mechanistic drug modeling: moving beyond binary drug-disease association tasks to granular transcriptional effects of therapeutic intervention.

Motivation: Existing GNN-based LP methods struggle with large-scale sparse graphs and dataset alignment in transfer learning; prior self-supervised graph methods also overlook transfer learning's generalization across datasets.

Method: GAATNet uses pre-training and fine-tuning for global node embedding transfer. Key strategies: 1) Distant neighbor embeddings as biases in self-attention to capture global features; 2) Lightweight self-adapter module during fine-tuning for efficiency.

Result: GAATNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in LP tasks across seven public datasets.

Conclusion: GAATNet provides a general, scalable solution integrating GNNs with transfer learning for effective link prediction.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have brought revolutionary advancements to the field of link prediction (LP), providing powerful tools for mining potential relationships in graphs. However, existing methods face challenges when dealing with large-scale sparse graphs and the need for a high degree of alignment between different datasets in transfer learning. Besides, although self-supervised methods have achieved remarkable success in many graph tasks, prior research has overlooked the potential of transfer learning to generalize across different graph datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Graph Attention Adaptive Transfer Network (GAATNet). It combines the advantages of pre-training and fine-tuning to capture global node embedding information across datasets of different scales, ensuring efficient knowledge transfer and improved LP performance. To enhance the model's generalization ability and accelerate training, we design two key strategies: 1) Incorporate distant neighbor embeddings as biases in the self-attention module to capture global features. 2) Introduce a lightweight self-adapter module during fine-tuning to improve training efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate that GAATNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in LP tasks. This study provides a general and scalable solution for LP tasks to effectively integrate GNNs with transfer learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study developed a predictive model for cardiac death risk post-PCI using real and synthetic data, analyzed feature importance, and found that data augmentation improves model performance on minority classes while identifying key influential factors like Age and Ejection Fraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To predict long-term cardiac death risk after PCI, address class imbalance in clinical data, and identify the most impactful factors on mortality.

Method: Analyzed 2044 PCI patients with bifurcation lesions; applied multiple machine learning models; generated 500 synthetic samples to augment training data; used permutation feature importance to evaluate feature contributions; conducted experiments removing non-informative features.

Result: Without oversampling, models had high overall accuracy (0.92-0.93) but ignored the minority class. Augmentation increased minority-class recall with minimal AUROC loss, improved probability quality, and gave reasonable risk estimates on severe profiles. The four most influential features were Age, Ejection Fraction, Peripheral Artery Disease, and Cerebrovascular Disease.

Conclusion: Straightforward augmentation with realistic and extreme cases can expose, quantify, and reduce brittleness in imbalanced clinical prediction using tabular records, emphasizing the need for routine reporting of probability quality and stress tests alongside headline metrics.

Abstract: Patient status, angiographic and procedural characteristics encode crucial signals for predicting long-term outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The aim of the study was to develop a predictive model for assessing the risk of cardiac death based on the real and synthetic data of patients undergoing PCI and to identify the factors that have the greatest impact on mortality. We analyzed 2,044 patients, who underwent a PCI for bifurcation lesions. The primary outcome was cardiac death at 3-year follow-up. Several machine learning models were applied to predict three-year mortality after PCI. To address class imbalance and improve the representation of the minority class, an additional 500 synthetic samples were generated and added to the training set. To evaluate the contribution of individual features to model performance, we applied permutation feature importance. An additional experiment was conducted to evaluate how the model's predictions would change after removing non-informative features from the training and test datasets. Without oversampling, all models achieve high overall accuracy (0.92-0.93), yet they almost completely ignore the minority class. Across models, augmentation consistently increases minority-class recall with minimal loss of AUROC, improves probability quality, and yields more clinically reasonable risk estimates on the constructed severe profiles. According to feature importance analysis, four features emerged as the most influential: Age, Ejection Fraction, Peripheral Artery Disease, and Cerebrovascular Disease. These results show that straightforward augmentation with realistic and extreme cases can expose, quantify, and reduce brittleness in imbalanced clinical prediction using only tabular records, and motivate routine reporting of probability quality and stress tests alongside headline metrics.

TL;DR: This paper presents a systematic ablation study of a physics-informed grating coupler spectrum generator, uncovering a physics constraint paradox, identifying pitfalls in noise handling, evaluating generation speed, and revealing a physics-learnability trade-off in downstream ML tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue that existing physics-constrained data generation approaches often over-constrain models without identifying necessary physical components, especially in scientific domains with scarce real data.

Method: A systematic ablation study of a physics-informed grating coupler spectrum generator mapping five geometric parameters to 100-point spectral responses, selectively removing explicit energy conservation enforcement, Fabry-Perot oscillations, bandwidth variation, and noise.

Result: 1) Explicit energy conservation enforcement is redundant (constrained/unconstrained variants have identical conservation accuracy ~7e-9); 2) Removing Fabry-Perot oscillations reduces half-max bandwidth spread by 72% (132.3nm→37.4nm);3) Standard noise-addition-plus-renormalization introduces 0.5% unphysical negative absorption;4) Generator operates at 200 samples/s (orders faster than full-wave solvers);5) Removing Fabry-Perot oscillations improves bandwidth prediction (31.3% R² increase,73.8% RMSE reduction), while central wavelength prediction is unaffected.

Conclusion: The findings provide actionable guidance for physics-informed dataset design and highlight ML performance as a diagnostic tool for assessing constraint relevance.

Abstract: Physics-constrained data generation is essential for machine learning in scientific domains where real data are scarce; however, existing approaches often over-constrain models without identifying which physical components are necessary. We present a systematic ablation study of a physics-informed grating coupler spectrum generator that maps five geometric parameters to 100-point spectral responses. By selectively removing explicit energy conservation enforcement, Fabry-Perot oscillations, bandwidth variation, and noise, we uncover a physics constraint paradox: explicit energy conservation enforcement is mathematically redundant when the underlying equations are physically consistent, with constrained and unconstrained variants achieving identical conservation accuracy (mean error approximately 7 x 10^-9). In contrast, Fabry-Perot oscillations dominate threshold-based bandwidth variability, accounting for a 72 percent reduction in half-maximum bandwidth spread when removed (with bandwidth spread reduced from 132.3 nm to 37.4 nm). We further identify a subtle pitfall: standard noise-addition-plus-renormalization pipelines introduce 0.5 percent unphysical negative absorption values. The generator operates at 200 samples per second, enabling high-throughput data generation and remaining orders of magnitude faster than typical full-wave solvers reported in the literature. Finally, downstream machine learning evaluation reveals a clear physics-learnability trade-off: while central wavelength prediction remains unaffected, removing Fabry-Perot oscillations improves bandwidth prediction accuracy by 31.3 percent in R-squared and reduces RMSE by 73.8 percent. These findings provide actionable guidance for physics-informed dataset design and highlight machine learning performance as a diagnostic tool for assessing constraint relevance.

Abstract: PNNs present promising opportunities for accelerating machine learning by leveraging the unique benefits of photonic circuits. However, current state of the art PNN simulation tools face significant scalability challenges when training large-scale PNNs, due to the computational demands of transfer matrix calculations, resulting in high memory and time consumption. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Slicing method, an efficient transfer matrix computation approach compatible with back-propagation. We integrate this method into LuxIA, a unified simulation and training framework. The Slicing method substantially reduces memory usage and execution time, enabling scalable simulation and training of large PNNs. Experimental evaluations across various photonic architectures and standard datasets, including MNIST, Digits, and Olivetti Faces, show that LuxIA consistently surpasses existing tools in speed and scalability. Our results advance the state of the art in PNN simulation, making it feasible to explore and optimize larger, more complex architectures. By addressing key computational bottlenecks, LuxIA facilitates broader adoption and accelerates innovation in AI hardware through photonic technologies. This work paves the way for more efficient and scalable photonic neural network research and development.

*Bing Hao,Minglai Shao,Zengyi Wo,Yunlong Chu,Yuhang Liu,Ruijie Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) for temporal motif analysis on dynamic graphs, proposing a benchmark (LLMTM), a tool-augmented LLM agent, and a structure-aware dispatcher to balance accuracy and cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread use of LLMs and the importance of temporal motifs in dynamic graphs, yet leveraging LLMs for temporal motif analysis remains under-explored.

Method: 1) Propose LLMTM benchmark with six tasks across nine temporal motif types; 2) Develop a tool-augmented LLM agent with precise prompts; 3) Design a structure-aware dispatcher considering graph structural properties and LLM cognitive load to dispatch queries between standard prompting and the agent.

Result: The structure-aware dispatcher effectively maintains high accuracy while reducing cost compared to using the agent alone.

Conclusion: LLMs can be applied to temporal motif analysis tasks via tailored benchmarks and agents, and a structure-aware dispatcher helps balance accuracy and cost in such applications.

Abstract: The widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) has motivated a growing interest in their capacity for processing dynamic graphs. Temporal motifs, as an elementary unit and important local property of dynamic graphs which can directly reflect anomalies and unique phenomena, are essential for understanding their evolutionary dynamics and structural features. However, leveraging LLMs for temporal motif analysis on dynamic graphs remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we systematically study LLM performance on temporal motif-related tasks. Specifically, we propose a comprehensive benchmark, LLMTM (Large Language Models in Temporal Motifs), which includes six tailored tasks across nine temporal motif types. We then conduct extensive experiments to analyze the impacts of different prompting techniques and LLMs (including nine models: openPangu-7B, the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen series, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-R1, and o3) on model performance. Informed by our benchmark findings, we develop a tool-augmented LLM agent that leverages precisely engineered prompts to solve these tasks with high accuracy. Nevertheless, the high accuracy of the agent incurs a substantial cost. To address this trade-off, we propose a simple yet effective structure-aware dispatcher that considers both the dynamic graph's structural properties and the LLM's cognitive load to intelligently dispatch queries between the standard LLM prompting and the more powerful agent. Our experiments demonstrate that the structure-aware dispatcher effectively maintains high accuracy while reducing cost.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses reproducibility issues in radiation-induced grafting (RIG) by proposing a hierarchical stacking optimization framework (SoDip) that integrates Transformer, TabNet/XGBoost, GPR with DPMM, and Bayesian Optimization, achieving better performance than prior models and enabling morphology-aware design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reproducibility in RIG is limited due to unreported base-film morphology variability (crystallinity, grain orientation, free volume) that affects monomer diffusion, radical distribution, and Trommsdorff effect, leading to spatial graft gradients and performance inconsistencies.

Method: A hierarchical data-driven framework SoDip is presented, which includes: 1) DeepSeek-R1 Transformer to encode textual process descriptors; 2) TabNet and XGBoost for multimodal feature interactions; 3) GPR with DPMM for uncertainty quantification and heteroscedasticity; 4) Bayesian Optimization for high-dimensional synthesis space exploration. A diverse dataset is curated using ChemDataExtractor 2.0 and WebPlotDigitizer from hundreds of RIG studies.

Result: In cross-validation, SoDip achieved ~33% improvement over GPR, provided calibrated confidence intervals identifying low-reproducibility regimes, and outperformed prior models by integrating sparse textual and numerical inputs of varying quality.

Conclusion: SoDip outperforms prior models and establishes a foundation for reproducible, morphology-aware design in graft polymerization research.

Abstract: Radiation-induced grafting (RIG) enables precise functionalization of polymer films for ion-exchange membranes, CO2-separation membranes, and battery electrolytes by generating radicals on robust substrates to graft desired monomers. However, reproducibility remains limited due to unreported variability in base-film morphology (crystallinity, grain orientation, free volume), which governs monomer diffusion, radical distribution, and the Trommsdorff effect, leading to spatial graft gradients and performance inconsistencies. We present a hierarchical stacking optimization framework with a Dirichlet's Process (SoDip), a hierarchical data-driven framework integrating: (1) a decoder-only Transformer (DeepSeek-R1) to encode textual process descriptors (irradiation source, grafting type, substrate manufacturer); (2) TabNet and XGBoost for modelling multimodal feature interactions; (3) Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with Dirichlet Process Mixture Models (DPMM) for uncertainty quantification and heteroscedasticity; and (4) Bayesian Optimization for efficient exploration of high-dimensional synthesis space. A diverse dataset was curated using ChemDataExtractor 2.0 and WebPlotDigitizer, incorporating numerical and textual variables across hundreds of RIG studies. In cross-validation, SoDip achieved ~33% improvement over GPR while providing calibrated confidence intervals that identify low-reproducibility regimes. Its stacked architecture integrates sparse textual and numerical inputs of varying quality, outperforming prior models and establishing a foundation for reproducible, morphology-aware design in graft polymerization research.

*Varshith Gudur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Valori, a deterministic AI memory substrate using fixed-point arithmetic (Q16.16) to address non-determinism in vector embedding storage/search across hardware, ensuring bit-identical results for replayability and auditability in regulated sectors; the implementation is open-source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern AI systems using floating-point arithmetic for vector embeddings have fundamental non-determinism across hardware (x86 vs ARM), preventing replayability, safe deployment, post-hoc verification, and compromising audit trails in regulated sectors.

Method: Valori replaces floating-point memory operations with fixed-point arithmetic (Q16.16) and models memory as a replayable state machine to enforce determinism at the memory boundary.

Result: Valori guarantees bit-identical memory states, snapshots, and search results across different platforms; the paper demonstrates non-determinism arises before indexing/retrieval and how Valori mitigates it.

Conclusion: Deterministic memory (as provided by Valori) is a necessary primitive for trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Modern AI systems rely on vector embeddings stored and searched using floating-point arithmetic. While effective for approximate similarity search, this design introduces fundamental non-determinism: identical models, inputs, and code can produce different memory states and retrieval results across hardware architectures (e.g., x86 vs. ARM). This prevents replayability and safe deployment, leading to silent data divergence that prevents post-hoc verification and compromises audit trails in regulated sectors. We present Valori, a deterministic AI memory substrate that replaces floating-point memory operations with fixed-point arithmetic (Q16.16) and models memory as a replayable state machine. Valori guarantees bit-identical memory states, snapshots, and search results across platforms. We demonstrate that non-determinism arises before indexing or retrieval and show how Valori enforces determinism at the memory boundary. Our results suggest that deterministic memory is a necessary primitive for trustworthy AI systems.

TL;DR: This paper proposes DBAW-PIKAN, a physics-informed neural network combining Kolmogorov-Arnold architecture with adaptive weighting, to address stiffness and spectral bias issues in PINNs for multi-scale/high-frequency problems, showing improved accuracy and convergence in numerical benchmarks.


<details>

Method: The proposed DBAW-PIKAN integrates Kolmogorov-Arnold network architecture (using learnable B-splines) with an adaptive weighting strategy that includes a dynamic decay upper bound.

Result: Compared to baseline models, DBAW-PIKAN accelerates convergence and improves solution accuracy by at least an order of magnitude without extra computational complexity; it shows significant advantages in accuracy and generalization across Klein-Gordon, Burgers, and Helmholtz equation benchmarks.

Conclusion: DBAW-PIKAN effectively addresses the limitations of PINNs in multi-scale/high-frequency problems, enhancing both accuracy and generalization performance as demonstrated by numerical experiments.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have led to significant advancements in scientific computing by integrating fundamental physical principles with advanced data-driven techniques. However, when dealing with problems characterized by multi-scale or high-frequency features, PINNs encounter persistent and severe challenges related to stiffness in gradient flow and spectral bias, which significantly limit their predictive capabilities. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Dynamic Balancing Adaptive Weighting Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (DBAW-PIKAN), designed to mitigate such gradient-related failure modes and overcome the bottlenecks in function representation. The core of DBAW-PIKAN combines the Kolmogorov-Arnold network architecture, based on learnable B-splines, with an adaptive weighting strategy that incorporates a dynamic decay upper bound. Compared to baseline models, the proposed method accelerates the convergence process and improves solution accuracy by at least an order of magnitude without introducing additional computational complexity. A series of numerical benchmarks, including the Klein-Gordon, Burgers, and Helmholtz equations, demonstrate the significant advantages of DBAW-PIKAN in enhancing both accuracy and generalization performance.

### [87] [Cluster Aggregated GAN (CAG): A Cluster-Based Hybrid Model for Appliance Pattern Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22287)
*Zikun Guoa,Adeyinka. P. Adedigbaa,Rammohan Mallipeddi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Cluster Aggregated GAN framework to generate synthetic appliance data for non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM), addressing limitations of existing GAN-based methods by using specialized branches for intermittent and continuous appliances, with experiments showing improved realism, diversity, and training stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of labeled datasets hinders NILM algorithm development and privacy-preserving energy research; existing GAN-based methods treat all devices uniformly, leading to unstable training and limited output fidelity due to neglecting behavioral differences between intermittent and continuous appliances.

Method: The Cluster Aggregated GAN framework uses specialized branches: for intermittent appliances, a clustering module groups similar activation patterns and allocates dedicated generators per cluster; for continuous appliances, an LSTM-based generator captures gradual temporal evolution with sequence compression to maintain stability.

Result: Extensive experiments on the UVIC smart plug dataset show the framework outperforms baselines in realism, diversity, and training stability; integrating clustering as an active generative component improves interpretability and scalability.

Conclusion: The proposed Cluster Aggregated GAN framework is an effective approach for synthetic load generation in NILM research.

Abstract: Synthetic appliance data are essential for developing non-intrusive load monitoring algorithms and enabling privacy preserving energy research, yet the scarcity of labeled datasets remains a significant barrier. Recent GAN-based methods have demonstrated the feasibility of synthesizing load patterns, but most existing approaches treat all devices uniformly within a single model, neglecting the behavioral differences between intermittent and continuous appliances and resulting in unstable training and limited output fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose the Cluster Aggregated GAN framework, a hybrid generative approach that routes each appliance to a specialized branch based on its behavioral characteristics. For intermittent appliances, a clustering module groups similar activation patterns and allocates dedicated generators for each cluster, ensuring that both common and rare operational modes receive adequate modeling capacity. Continuous appliances follow a separate branch that employs an LSTM-based generator to capture gradual temporal evolution while maintaining training stability through sequence compression. Extensive experiments on the UVIC smart plug dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms baseline methods across metrics measuring realism, diversity, and training stability, and that integrating clustering as an active generative component substantially improves both interpretability and scalability. These findings establish the proposed framework as an effective approach for synthetic load generation in non-intrusive load monitoring research.

### [88] [Co-GRPO: Co-Optimized Group Relative Policy Optimization for Masked Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22288)
*Renping Zhou,Zanlin Ni,Tianyi Chen,Zeyu Liu,Yang Yue,Yulin Wang,Yuxuan Wang,Jingshu Liu,Gao Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Co-GRPO, a method that reformulates Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) generation as a unified Markov Decision Process (MDP) to align training with inference by cooperatively optimizing model and schedule parameters, leading to improved generation quality across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The discrepancy between MDMs' training (simplified single-step BERT-style objective) and inference (multi-step iterative process governed by token-decoding schedules) disconnects training from inference, as schedules are not optimized during training.

Method: Co-GRPO reformulates MDM generation as a unified MDP, applying Group Relative Policy Optimization at the trajectory level to cooperatively optimize model and schedule parameters under a shared reward, avoiding costly backpropagation through multi-step generation.

Result: Empirical results across four benchmarks (ImageReward, HPS, GenEval, DPG-Bench) demonstrate the effectiveness of Co-GRPO in improving generation quality.

Conclusion: Co-GRPO's holistic optimization aligns training with inference more thoroughly and substantially improves generation quality.

Abstract: Recently, Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) have shown promising potential across vision, language, and cross-modal generation. However, a notable discrepancy exists between their training and inference procedures. In particular, MDM inference is a multi-step, iterative process governed not only by the model itself but also by various schedules that dictate the token-decoding trajectory (e.g., how many tokens to decode at each step). In contrast, MDMs are typically trained using a simplified, single-step BERT-style objective that masks a subset of tokens and predicts all of them simultaneously. This step-level simplification fundamentally disconnects the training paradigm from the trajectory-level nature of inference, leaving the inference schedules never optimized during training. In this paper, we introduce Co-GRPO, which reformulates MDM generation as a unified Markov Decision Process (MDP) that jointly incorporates both the model and the inference schedule. By applying Group Relative Policy Optimization at the trajectory level, Co-GRPO cooperatively optimizes model parameters and schedule parameters under a shared reward, without requiring costly backpropagation through the multi-step generation process. This holistic optimization aligns training with inference more thoroughly and substantially improves generation quality. Empirical results across four benchmarks-ImageReward, HPS, GenEval, and DPG-Bench-demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a language-aware multimodal nowcasting framework (LangPrecip) that integrates meteorological text as semantic motion constraints into precipitation evolution forecasting under the Rectified Flow paradigm, along with a large-scale dataset LangPrecip-160k, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in heavy-rainfall CSI at long lead times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Short-term precipitation nowcasting is an uncertain and under-constrained spatiotemporal problem, especially for rapidly evolving and extreme weather events; existing generative approaches rely mainly on visual conditioning, leading to weakly constrained and ambiguous future motion.

Method: 1) Propose LangPrecip, a language-aware multimodal nowcasting framework that treats meteorological text as semantic motion constraints on precipitation evolution; 2) Formulate nowcasting as a semantically constrained trajectory generation problem under the Rectified Flow paradigm to efficiently and physically consistently integrate textual and radar information in latent space; 3) Introduce LangPrecip-160k, a large-scale multimodal dataset with 160k paired radar sequences and motion descriptions.

Result: Experiments on Swedish and MRMS datasets show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods: achieving over 60% gain in heavy-rainfall CSI at an 80-minute lead time on the Swedish dataset and 19% gain on the MRMS dataset.

Conclusion: Integrating meteorological text as semantic motion constraints into precipitation nowcasting via the Rectified Flow paradigm effectively improves the accuracy of heavy-rainfall forecasting at long lead times, and the proposed LangPrecip framework and LangPrecip-160k dataset contribute to advancing short-term precipitation nowcasting.

Abstract: Short-term precipitation nowcasting is an inherently uncertain and under-constrained spatiotemporal forecasting problem, especially for rapidly evolving and extreme weather events. Existing generative approaches rely primarily on visual conditioning, leaving future motion weakly constrained and ambiguous. We propose a language-aware multimodal nowcasting framework(LangPrecip) that treats meteorological text as a semantic motion constraint on precipitation evolution. By formulating nowcasting as a semantically constrained trajectory generation problem under the Rectified Flow paradigm, our method enables efficient and physically consistent integration of textual and radar information in latent space.We further introduce LangPrecip-160k, a large-scale multimodal dataset with 160k paired radar sequences and motion descriptions.

### [90] [Decomposing Uncertainty in Probabilistic Knowledge Graph Embeddings: Why Entity Variance Is Not Enough](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22318)
*Chorok Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the limitation of relation-agnostic variances in probabilistic knowledge graph embeddings, proves their inadequacy for novel relational context OOD detection, decomposes uncertainty into semantic and structural components, and proposes CAGP which combines these to achieve significant improvements in temporal OOD detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing probabilistic knowledge graph embeddings use relation-agnostic entity variances, conflating emerging entities (rare, poorly-learned) and novel relational contexts (familiar entities in unobserved relationships), leading to poor OOD detection on novel contexts.

Method: The paper formalizes uncertainty decomposition into semantic uncertainty (from entity embedding variance, detecting emerging entities) and structural uncertainty (from entity-relation co-occurrence, detecting novel contexts). Their method CAGP combines these two complementary uncertainty components via learned weights.

Result: CAGP achieves 0.94-0.99 AUROC on temporal OOD detection across benchmarks (FB15k-237, WN18RR, YAGO3-10), a 60-80% relative improvement over relation-agnostic baselines. It also reduces errors by 43% at 85% answer rate on selective prediction. Empirically, 100% of novel-context triples have frequency-matched in-distribution counterparts, validating the need for structural uncertainty.

Conclusion: Relation-agnostic uncertainty in probabilistic KG embeddings is insufficient for OOD detection of novel relational contexts. Combining semantic and structural uncertainty components (as in CAGP) strictly dominates either alone, leading to strong performance on temporal OOD detection and selective prediction.

Abstract: Probabilistic knowledge graph embeddings represent entities as distributions, using learned variances to quantify epistemic uncertainty. We identify a fundamental limitation: these variances are relation-agnostic, meaning an entity receives identical uncertainty regardless of relational context. This conflates two distinct out-of-distribution phenomena that behave oppositely: emerging entities (rare, poorly-learned) and novel relational contexts (familiar entities in unobserved relationships). We prove an impossibility result: any uncertainty estimator using only entity-level statistics independent of relation context achieves near-random OOD detection on novel contexts. We empirically validate this on three datasets, finding 100 percent of novel-context triples have frequency-matched in-distribution counterparts. This explains why existing probabilistic methods achieve 0.99 AUROC on random corruptions but only 0.52-0.64 on temporal distribution shift. We formalize uncertainty decomposition into complementary components: semantic uncertainty from entity embedding variance (detecting emerging entities) and structural uncertainty from entity-relation co-occurrence (detecting novel contexts). Our main theoretical result proves these signals are non-redundant, and that any convex combination strictly dominates either signal alone. Our method (CAGP) combines semantic and structural uncertainty via learned weights, achieving 0.94-0.99 AUROC on temporal OOD detection across multiple benchmarks, a 60-80 percent relative improvement over relation-agnostic baselines. Empirical validation confirms complete frequency overlap on three datasets (FB15k-237, WN18RR, YAGO3-10). On selective prediction, our method reduces errors by 43 percent at 85 percent answer rate.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper integrates Global M2 Liquidity as a leading exogenous variable with a 12-week lag into the TimeXer architecture to forecast Bitcoin prices, showing that this liquidity-conditioned model (TimeXer-Exog) outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in long-horizon forecasts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bitcoin price forecasting faces challenges of extreme volatility and non-stationarity, which traditional univariate time-series models often fail to handle over long horizons; there is a gap in integrating relevant macroeconomic variables to improve such forecasts.

Method: The study uses the TimeXer architecture and compares a liquidity-conditioned model (TimeXer-Exog) with Global M2 Liquidity (18 major economies, 12-week lag) against benchmarks like LSTM, N-BEATS, PatchTST, and univariate TimeXer, using daily Bitcoin price data from Jan 2020 to Aug 2025.

Result: At a 70-day forecast horizon, TimeXer-Exog achieves an MSE of 1.08e8, outperforming the univariate TimeXer baseline by over 89 percent; explicit macroeconomic conditioning significantly stabilizes long-horizon Bitcoin price forecasts.

Conclusion: Incorporating global liquidity as an exogenous variable into deep learning models (like TimeXer-Exog) provides substantial improvements in long-horizon Bitcoin price forecasting.

Abstract: Bitcoin price forecasting is characterized by extreme volatility and non-stationarity, often defying traditional univariate time-series models over long horizons. This paper addresses a critical gap by integrating Global M2 Liquidity, aggregated from 18 major economies, as a leading exogenous variable with a 12-week lag structure. Using the TimeXer architecture, we compare a liquidity-conditioned forecasting model (TimeXer-Exog) against state-of-the-art benchmarks including LSTM, N-BEATS, PatchTST, and a standard univariate TimeXer. Experiments conducted on daily Bitcoin price data from January 2020 to August 2025 demonstrate that explicit macroeconomic conditioning significantly stabilizes long-horizon forecasts. At a 70-day forecast horizon, the proposed TimeXer-Exog model achieves a mean squared error (MSE) 1.08e8, outperforming the univariate TimeXer baseline by over 89 percent. These results highlight that conditioning deep learning models on global liquidity provides substantial improvements in long-horizon Bitcoin price forecasting.

*Matthew Riemer,Erik Miehling,Miao Liu,Djallel Bouneffouf,Murray Campbell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper identifies catastrophic degradation in LoRA-based instruction tuning and proposes a regularized approximate replay approach to mitigate it while preserving model knowledge and plasticity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA-based supervised fine-tuning can catastrophically degrade model capabilities even with small datasets and few steps, which is a critical issue for parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Method: A regularized approximate replay approach that penalizes KL divergence with the initial model and interleaves next token prediction data from a similar open access corpus as pre-training.

Result: The proposed recipe preserves general knowledge in Qwen instruction-tuned models without hindering plasticity to new tasks, with modest computational overhead.

Conclusion: Small tweaks to the training procedure (regularized approximate replay) can eliminate catastrophic degradation in LoRA-based instruction tuning, balancing knowledge preservation and task plasticity.

Abstract: Although parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, such as LoRA, only modify a small subset of parameters, they can have a significant impact on the model. Our instruction-tuning experiments show that LoRA-based supervised fine-tuning can catastrophically degrade model capabilities, even when trained on very small datasets for relatively few steps. With that said, we demonstrate that while the most straightforward approach (that is likely the most used in practice) fails spectacularly, small tweaks to the training procedure with very little overhead can virtually eliminate the problem. Particularly, in this paper we consider a regularized approximate replay approach which penalizes KL divergence with respect to the initial model and interleaves in data for next token prediction from a different, yet similar, open access corpus to what was used in pre-training. When applied to Qwen instruction-tuned models, we find that this recipe preserves general knowledge in the model without hindering plasticity to new tasks by adding a modest amount of computational overhead.

TL;DR: This paper extends hyperparameter transfer works (like μP) by proposing Complete^(d) Parameterisation for unifying scaling across width, depth, batch-size, and training duration, then investigates per-module hyperparameter optimisation/transfer with practical guidelines, showing significant training speed improvements in LLMs via transferred per-module hyperparameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing hyperparameter transfer works (e.g., μP) that may not cover all important scaling axes and lack exploration of per-module hyperparameter optimisation/transfer for large-scale models.

Method: 1) Propose Complete^(d) Parameterisation unifying scaling in width, depth (adapting CompleteP), batch-size, and training duration; 2) Investigate per-module hyperparameter optimisation and transfer, characterise empirical challenges, and provide practical guidelines; 3) Cover various optimisation hyperparameters (learning rates, AdamW parameters, weight decay, initialisation scales, residual block multipliers) and test on Large Language Models.

Result: Transferred per-module hyperparameters lead to significant training speed improvements in Large Language Models.

Conclusion: Complete^(d) Parameterisation enables effective hyperparameter transfer across multiple scaling axes, and per-module hyperparameter transfer (with proper guidelines) can boost training speed of LLMs.

Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning can dramatically impact training stability and final performance of large-scale models. Recent works on neural network parameterisations, such as $μ$P, have enabled transfer of optimal global hyperparameters across model sizes. These works propose an empirical practice of search for optimal global base hyperparameters at a small model size, and transfer to a large size. We extend these works in two key ways. To handle scaling along most important scaling axes, we propose the Complete$^{(d)}$ Parameterisation that unifies scaling in width and depth -- using an adaptation of CompleteP -- as well as in batch-size and training duration. Secondly, with our parameterisation, we investigate per-module hyperparameter optimisation and transfer. We characterise the empirical challenges of navigating the high-dimensional hyperparameter landscape, and propose practical guidelines for tackling this optimisation problem. We demonstrate that, with the right parameterisation, hyperparameter transfer holds even in the per-module hyperparameter regime. Our study covers an extensive range of optimisation hyperparameters of modern models: learning rates, AdamW parameters, weight decay, initialisation scales, and residual block multipliers. Our experiments demonstrate significant training speed improvements in Large Language Models with the transferred per-module hyperparameters.

TL;DR: BLISS is a dynamic node sampling strategy using multi-armed bandits to improve GNN scalability on large graphs by selecting informative nodes adaptively, outperforming static methods while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs face computational and memory bottlenecks when applied to large graphs due to the need to process every neighbor for each node, limiting their scalability.

Method: BLISS (Bandit Layer Importance Sampling Strategy) uses multi-armed bandits to dynamically select the most informative nodes at each layer, balancing exploration and exploitation. It integrates with GCNs and GATs by adapting its selection policy to their aggregation mechanisms.

Result: BLISS maintains or exceeds the accuracy of full-batch training while reducing computational overhead, demonstrating superior performance compared to static sampling methods.

Conclusion: Dynamic node sampling via multi-armed bandits is an effective approach to enhance GNN scalability on large graphs without compromising accuracy, with BLISS showing versatility across different GNN architectures.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for learning from graph-structured data, but their application to large graphs is hindered by computational costs. The need to process every neighbor for each node creates memory and computational bottlenecks. To address this, we introduce BLISS, a Bandit Layer Importance Sampling Strategy. It uses multi-armed bandits to dynamically select the most informative nodes at each layer, balancing exploration and exploitation to ensure comprehensive graph coverage. Unlike existing static sampling methods, BLISS adapts to evolving node importance, leading to more informed node selection and improved performance. It demonstrates versatility by integrating with both Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs), adapting its selection policy to their specific aggregation mechanisms. Experiments show that BLISS maintains or exceeds the accuracy of full-batch training.

*Jianxiang Xie,Yuncheng Hua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes CRC, a causality-inspired safe residual correction framework for multivariate forecasting to address performance degradation issues in deployment, which improves accuracy and ensures high non-degradation rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern multivariate forecasters like Transformers and GNNs have strong benchmark performance but suffer from systematic errors at specific variables/horizons and lack guarantees against performance degradation in deployment; existing post-hoc residual correction methods are greedy and may cause local failures in unseen scenarios.

Method: CRC uses a causality-inspired encoder to decouple self- and cross-variable dynamics, a hybrid corrector to model residual errors, and a strict four-fold safety mechanism to prevent harmful updates.

Result: Experiments across multiple datasets and backbones show CRC consistently improves accuracy, and ablation studies confirm its core safety mechanisms ensure exceptionally high non-degradation rates (NDR).

Conclusion: CRC is a correction framework suited for safe and reliable deployment of multivariate forecasting models.

Abstract: While modern multivariate forecasters such as Transformers and GNNs achieve strong benchmark performance, they often suffer from systematic errors at specific variables or horizons and, critically, lack guarantees against performance degradation in deployment. Existing post-hoc residual correction methods attempt to fix these errors, but are inherently greedy: although they may improve average accuracy, they can also "help in the wrong way" by overcorrecting reliable predictions and causing local failures in unseen scenarios.
  To address this critical "safety gap," we propose CRC (Causality-inspired Safe Residual Correction), a plug-and-play framework explicitly designed to ensure non-degradation. CRC follows a divide-and-conquer philosophy: it employs a causality-inspired encoder to expose direction-aware structure by decoupling self- and cross-variable dynamics, and a hybrid corrector to model residual errors. Crucially, the correction process is governed by a strict four-fold safety mechanism that prevents harmful updates.
  Experiments across multiple datasets and forecasting backbones show that CRC consistently improves accuracy, while an in-depth ablation study confirms that its core safety mechanisms ensure exceptionally high non-degradation rates (NDR), making CRC a correction framework suited for safe and reliable deployment.

*Jiacheng Li,Jianchao Tan,Zhidong Yang,Feiye Huo,Yerui Sun,Yuchen Xie,Xunliang Cai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes AFA-LoRA, a novel training strategy for Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) that introduces non-linear expressivity while preserving mergeability, reducing the performance gap between LoRA and full-parameter training across supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and speculative decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited expressive power of LoRA's linear adaptation process, which creates a gap between linear and non-linear training expressivity.

Method: The key innovation is an annealed activation function that transitions from non-linear to linear during training, enabling the adapter to start with stronger representational capabilities and converge to a mergeable linear form; implemented on supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and speculative decoding.

Result: AFA-LoRA reduces the performance gap between LoRA and full-parameter training.

Conclusion: This work enables a more powerful and practical paradigm of parameter-efficient adaptation.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely adopted parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. However, its linear adaptation process limits its expressive power. This means there is a gap between the expressive power of linear training and non-linear training. To bridge this gap, we propose AFA-LoRA, a novel training strategy that brings non-linear expressivity to LoRA while maintaining its seamless mergeability. Our key innovation is an annealed activation function that transitions from a non-linear to a linear transformation during training, allowing the adapter to initially adopt stronger representational capabilities before converging to a mergeable linear form. We implement our method on supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and speculative decoding. The results show that AFA-LoRA reduces the performance gap between LoRA and full-parameter training. This work enables a more powerful and practical paradigm of parameter-efficient adaptation.

*Qizhi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents AMBIT, a gray-box framework combining physical mobility baselines with interpretable tree models to address the conflict between high accuracy and interpretability in OD flow prediction, validated on NYC taxi data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the conflicting needs of high accuracy and clear interpretability in practical OD flow prediction deployments.

Method: 1) Audit classical spatial interaction models on NYC taxi OD data; 2) Build residual learners using gradient-boosted trees and SHAP analysis on top of physical baselines; 3) Evaluate physics-grounded and POI-anchored residuals.

Result: 1) Most physical models are fragile at hourly resolution; PPML gravity is the strongest baseline, constrained variants improve with full OD margin calibration but are weaker; 2) Physics-grounded residuals approach tree-based predictor accuracy while retaining interpretability; 3) POI-anchored residuals are competitive and most robust under spatial generalization.

Conclusion: AMBIT framework effectively balances accuracy and interpretability for OD flow prediction, with reproducible pipeline and diagnostics supporting urban decision-making.

Abstract: Origin-destination (OD) flow prediction remains a core task in GIS and urban analytics, yet practical deployments face two conflicting needs: high accuracy and clear interpretability. This paper develops AMBIT, a gray-box framework that augments physical mobility baselines with interpretable tree models. We begin with a comprehensive audit of classical spatial interaction models on a year-long, hourly NYC taxi OD dataset. The audit shows that most physical models are fragile at this temporal resolution; PPML gravity is the strongest physical baseline, while constrained variants improve when calibrated on full OD margins but remain notably weaker. We then build residual learners on top of physical baselines using gradient-boosted trees and SHAP analysis, demonstrating that (i) physics-grounded residuals approach the accuracy of a strong tree-based predictor while retaining interpretable structure, and (ii) POI-anchored residuals are consistently competitive and most robust under spatial generalization. We provide a reproducible pipeline, rich diagnostics, and spatial error analysis designed for urban decision-making.

*Jong-Ik Park,Shreyas Chaudhari,Srinivasa Pranav,Carlee Joe-Wong,José M. F. Moura*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes GLUE, a gradient-free method to unify multiple pretrained specialist models for domain expansion by learning convex combination coefficients via SPSA with only two forward passes per step, outperforming heuristic blending baselines and matching or exceeding full-gradient mixing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for domain expansion using expert model blending either use heuristic coefficients (leading to lower accuracy) or full backpropagation (computationally expensive), so there's a need for an efficient and effective way to learn mixture coefficients.

Method: GLUE initializes the target model as a convex combination of fixed experts, learning the mixture coefficients via a gradient-free two-point (SPSA) update that requires only two forward passes per step.

Result: GLUE improves test accuracy by up to 8.5% over data-size weighting and up to9.1% over proxy-metric selection; it either outperforms backpropagation-based full-gradient mixing or matches its performance within1.4% across three datasets and three network architectures.

Conclusion: GLUE provides an efficient and effective gradient-free approach to unify expert models for domain expansion, outperforming heuristic baselines and being competitive with full-gradient mixing methods.

Abstract: In many deployed systems (multilingual ASR, cross-hospital imaging, region-specific perception), multiple pretrained specialist models coexist. Yet, new target domains often require domain expansion: a generalized model that performs well beyond any single specialist's domain. Given such a new target domain, prior works seek a single strong initialization prior for the model parameters by first blending expert models to initialize a target model. However, heuristic blending -- using coefficients based on data size or proxy metrics -- often yields lower target-domain test accuracy, and learning the coefficients on the target loss typically requires computationally-expensive full backpropagation through the network. We propose GLUE, Gradient-free Learning To Unify Experts, which initializes the target model as a convex combination of fixed experts, learning the mixture coefficients of this combination via a gradient-free two-point (SPSA) update that requires only two forward passes per step. Across experiments on three datasets and three network architectures, GLUE produces a single prior that can be fine-tuned effectively to outperform baselines. GLUE improves test accuracy by up to 8.5% over data-size weighting and by up to 9.1% over proxy-metric selection. GLUE either outperforms backpropagation-based full-gradient mixing or matches its performance within 1.4%.

### [99] [The Bayesian Geometry of Transformer Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22471)
*Naman Aggarwal,Siddhartha R. Dalal,Vishal Misra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Bayesian wind tunnels to rigorously verify Transformers' Bayesian reasoning ability, showing small Transformers outperform MLPs in reproducing known posteriors via a geometric mechanism (residual streams as belief substrate, feed-forward networks for updates, attention for routing), and establishes hierarchical attention as key to Bayesian inference by design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously verify if Transformers perform Bayesian reasoning, as natural data lacks analytic posteriors and large models conflate reasoning with memorization.

Method: Construct Bayesian wind tunnels (controlled environments with known closed-form posteriors and no memorization possibility), then test small Transformers vs capacity-matched MLPs on bijection elimination and HMM state tracking tasks; use geometric diagnostics to analyze mechanisms.

Result: Small Transformers reproduce Bayesian posteriors with 1e-3 to 1e-4 bit accuracy, while MLPs fail by orders of magnitude; they implement Bayesian inference via residual streams (belief substrate), feed-forward networks (posterior update), attention (content-addressable routing); geometric diagnostics reveal orthogonal key bases, progressive query-key alignment, low-dimensional value manifold parameterized by posterior entropy; during training, the manifold unfurls while attention patterns stay stable (frame-precision dissociation).

Conclusion: Hierarchical attention realizes Bayesian inference by geometric design, explaining attention's necessity and flat architectures' failure; Bayesian wind tunnels provide a foundation for connecting small verifiable systems to large language model reasoning phenomena.

Abstract: Transformers often appear to perform Bayesian reasoning in context, but verifying this rigorously has been impossible: natural data lack analytic posteriors, and large models conflate reasoning with memorization. We address this by constructing \emph{Bayesian wind tunnels} -- controlled environments where the true posterior is known in closed form and memorization is provably impossible. In these settings, small transformers reproduce Bayesian posteriors with $10^{-3}$-$10^{-4}$ bit accuracy, while capacity-matched MLPs fail by orders of magnitude, establishing a clear architectural separation.
  Across two tasks -- bijection elimination and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) state tracking -- we find that transformers implement Bayesian inference through a consistent geometric mechanism: residual streams serve as the belief substrate, feed-forward networks perform the posterior update, and attention provides content-addressable routing. Geometric diagnostics reveal orthogonal key bases, progressive query-key alignment, and a low-dimensional value manifold parameterized by posterior entropy. During training this manifold unfurls while attention patterns remain stable, a \emph{frame-precision dissociation} predicted by recent gradient analyses.
  Taken together, these results demonstrate that hierarchical attention realizes Bayesian inference by geometric design, explaining both the necessity of attention and the failure of flat architectures. Bayesian wind tunnels provide a foundation for mechanistically connecting small, verifiable systems to reasoning phenomena observed in large language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies fail to explore collaborative optimization of imbalanced learning and model training, limiting performance improvements.

Method: A collaborative optimization Boosting model integrating density factor and confidence factor to design noise-resistant weight update mechanism and dynamic sampling strategy, with tight integration of modules for weight updates, sample region partitioning, and region-guided sampling.

Result: Extensive experiments on 20 public imbalanced datasets show the proposed model significantly outperforms eight state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The collaborative optimization approach of imbalanced learning and model training via the proposed Boosting model effectively improves performance on multiclass imbalanced tasks.

Abstract: Numerous studies attempt to mitigate classification bias caused by class imbalance. However, existing studies have yet to explore the collaborative optimization of imbalanced learning and model training. This constraint hinders further performance improvements. To bridge this gap, this study proposes a collaborative optimization Boosting model of multiclass imbalanced learning. This model is simple but effective by integrating the density factor and the confidence factor, this study designs a noise-resistant weight update mechanism and a dynamic sampling strategy. Rather than functioning as independent components, these modules are tightly integrated to orchestrate weight updates, sample region partitioning, and region-guided sampling. Thus, this study achieves the collaborative optimization of imbalanced learning and model training. Extensive experiments on 20 public imbalanced datasets demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms eight state-of-the-art baselines.

*Hassan Wasswa,Timothy Lynar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a scalable adaptive IoT threat detection framework that avoids continuous classifier retraining by using latent-space alignment and graph neural networks to handle concept drift, showing robust performance in real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-based IoT threat detection models rely on stationary datasets which fail to reflect dynamic real-world traffic with concept drift; existing periodic retraining has high overhead and catastrophic forgetting risks.

Method: Train a classifier once on latent-space representations of historical traffic; use an alignment model to map incoming traffic to the historical latent space before classification; transform low-dimensional latent representations into graph-structured format and classify via graph neural network.

Result: Experimental evaluations on real-world heterogeneous IoT traffic datasets show the framework maintains robust detection performance under concept drift.

Conclusion: The framework has potential for practical deployment in dynamic and large-scale IoT environments.

Abstract: Although AI-based models have achieved high accuracy in IoT threat detection, their deployment in enterprise environments is constrained by reliance on stationary datasets that fail to reflect the dynamic nature of real-world IoT NetFlow traffic, which is frequently affected by concept drift. Existing solutions typically rely on periodic classifier retraining, resulting in high computational overhead and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a scalable framework for adaptive IoT threat detection that eliminates the need for continuous classifier retraining. The proposed approach trains a classifier once on latent-space representations of historical traffic, while an alignment model maps incoming traffic to the learned historical latent space prior to classification, thereby preserving knowledge of previously observed attacks. To capture inter-instance relationships among attack samples, the low-dimensional latent representations are further transformed into a graph-structured format and classified using a graph neural network. Experimental evaluations on real-world heterogeneous IoT traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework maintains robust detection performance under concept drift. These results highlight the framework's potential for practical deployment in dynamic and large-scale IoT environments.

*Hamed Damirchi,Cristian Rodriguez-Opazo,Ehsan Abbasnejad,Zhen Zhang,Javen Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) extends to parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), finds that sparse subnetworks exist within LoRAs that match dense adapter performance, proposes Partial-LoRA to identify these subnetworks, and shows it reduces trainable parameters by up to 87% while maintaining/improving accuracy across vision and language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (which states over-parameterized networks have sparse winning tickets matching full performance) applies to parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA, given the growing reliance on fine-tuning large pretrained models.

Method: The paper first verifies LTH holds within LoRAs, then proposes Partial-LoRA—a method that systematically identifies sparse subnetworks in LoRAs and trains sparse low-rank adapters aligned with task-relevant subspaces of the pretrained model.

Result: Experiments across 8 vision and 12 language tasks (single-task and multi-task) show Partial-LoRA reduces trainable parameters by up to 87% while maintaining or improving accuracy compared to dense LoRA.

Conclusion: The results deepen theoretical understanding of transfer learning and the interplay between pretraining and fine-tuning, and open new avenues for more efficient adaptation strategies.

Abstract: The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) suggests that over-parameterized neural networks contain sparse subnetworks ("winning tickets") capable of matching full model performance when trained from scratch. With the growing reliance on fine-tuning large pretrained models, we investigate whether LTH extends to parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), specifically focusing on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) methods. Our key finding is that LTH holds within LoRAs, revealing sparse subnetworks that can match the performance of dense adapters. In particular, we find that the effectiveness of sparse subnetworks depends more on how much sparsity is applied in each layer than on the exact weights included in the subnetwork. Building on this insight, we propose Partial-LoRA, a method that systematically identifies said subnetworks and trains sparse low-rank adapters aligned with task-relevant subspaces of the pre-trained model. Experiments across 8 vision and 12 language tasks in both single-task and multi-task settings show that Partial-LoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters by up to 87\%, while maintaining or improving accuracy. Our results not only deepen our theoretical understanding of transfer learning and the interplay between pretraining and fine-tuning but also open new avenues for developing more efficient adaptation strategies.

*Lucky Susanto,Anasta Pranawijayana,Cortino Sukotjo,Soni Prasad,Derry Wijaya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study explores predicting LLM response correctness using metadata and hallucination signals on prosthodontics exams, finding metadata-based approaches improve accuracy but aren't robust enough for high-stakes use yet; it also notes prompting strategies alter model behaviors and metadata utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical yet underexplored problem of predicting whether an LLM's response is correct, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare where hallucinated information is a major concern.

Method: Investigate GPT-4o (general-purpose) and OSS-120B (reasoning-centric) models on a multiple-choice prosthodontics exam; build correctness predictors for each (model, prompting) pair using metadata and hallucination signals across three distinct prompting strategies.

Result: Metadata-based approach improves accuracy by up to +7.14% and achieves 83.12% precision over the baseline (assuming all answers correct); actual hallucination strongly indicates incorrectness but metadata alone isn't reliable for hallucination prediction; prompting strategies don't affect overall accuracy but significantly alter model internal behaviors and metadata predictive utility.

Conclusion: The results show a promising direction for developing LLM reliability signals, but the explored methods are not yet robust enough for critical, high-stakes deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in high-stakes domains such as healthcare and medical education, where the risk of generating factually incorrect (i.e., hallucinated) information is a major concern. While significant efforts have been made to detect and mitigate such hallucinations, predicting whether an LLM's response is correct remains a critical yet underexplored problem. This study investigates the feasibility of predicting correctness by analyzing a general-purpose model (GPT-4o) and a reasoning-centric model (OSS-120B) on a multiple-choice prosthodontics exam. We utilize metadata and hallucination signals across three distinct prompting strategies to build a correctness predictor for each (model, prompting) pair. Our findings demonstrate that this metadata-based approach can improve accuracy by up to +7.14% and achieve a precision of 83.12% over a baseline that assumes all answers are correct. We further show that while actual hallucination is a strong indicator of incorrectness, metadata signals alone are not reliable predictors of hallucination. Finally, we reveal that prompting strategies, despite not affecting overall accuracy, significantly alter the models' internal behaviors and the predictive utility of their metadata. These results present a promising direction for developing reliability signals in LLMs but also highlight that the methods explored in this paper are not yet robust enough for critical, high-stakes deployment.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a principled decomposition method for task vectors to separate shared and unique components, addressing interference issues in task vector arithmetic and demonstrating effectiveness in image classification, diffusion models, and language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting large pre-trained models to precise concept-specific behaviors via task vectors faces interference issues during arithmetic operations due to overlapping concepts, leading to unpredictable outcomes.

Method: A decomposition method that splits each task vector into shared knowledge components (across multiple task vectors) and unique task-specific components, using invariant subspaces across projections for precise control.

Result: 1) Improved multi-task merging in image classification by 5% using shared components; 2) Clean style mixing in diffusion models without degradation via unique components; 3) 47% toxicity reduction in language models while preserving general knowledge performance by negating unique toxic components.

Conclusion: The approach provides a new framework for understanding and controlling task vector arithmetic, solving fundamental limitations in model editing operations.

Abstract: Large pre-trained models have transformed machine learning, yet adapting these models effectively to exhibit precise, concept-specific behaviors remains a significant challenge. Task vectors, defined as the difference between fine-tuned and pre-trained model parameters, provide a mechanism for steering neural networks toward desired behaviors. This has given rise to large repositories dedicated to task vectors tailored for specific behaviors. The arithmetic operation of these task vectors allows for the seamless combination of desired behaviors without the need for large datasets. However, these vectors often contain overlapping concepts that can interfere with each other during arithmetic operations, leading to unpredictable outcomes. We propose a principled decomposition method that separates each task vector into two components: one capturing shared knowledge across multiple task vectors, and another isolating information unique to each specific task. By identifying invariant subspaces across projections, our approach enables more precise control over concept manipulation without unintended amplification or diminution of other behaviors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our decomposition method across three domains: improving multi-task merging in image classification by 5% using shared components as additional task vectors, enabling clean style mixing in diffusion models without generation degradation by mixing only the unique components, and achieving 47% toxicity reduction in language models while preserving performance on general knowledge tasks by negating the toxic information isolated to the unique component. Our approach provides a new framework for understanding and controlling task vector arithmetic, addressing fundamental limitations in model editing operations.

*Jihang Wang,Dongcheng Zhao,Ruolin Chen,Qian Zhang,Yi Zeng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the unreliable adversarial robustness evaluation of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) due to vanishing gradients from binary spike activations, proposes an Adaptive Sharpness Surrogate Gradient (ASSG) framework and Stable Adaptive Projected Gradient Descent (SA-PGD) attack to improve evaluation reliability, and finds current SNN robustness is overestimated.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The binary and discontinuous spike activations in SNNs cause vanishing gradients, making adversarial robustness evaluation via gradient descent unreliable; existing surrogate gradient methods lack effectiveness under strong attacks, leading to overestimated SNN robustness.

Method: 1) Theoretically analyze gradient vanishing degree in surrogate gradients; 2) Introduce Adaptive Sharpness Surrogate Gradient (ASSG) that adaptively adjusts surrogate function shape based on input distribution during attack iterations to enhance gradient accuracy and mitigate vanishing; 3) Design Stable Adaptive Projected Gradient Descent (SA-PGD) attack with adaptive step size under L∞ constraint for faster/stable convergence under imprecise gradients.

Result: Extensive experiments show the proposed approach significantly increases attack success rates across diverse adversarial training schemes, SNN architectures, and neuron models; current SNN robustness is found to be substantially overestimated.

Conclusion: The framework provides a more generalized and reliable evaluation of SNN adversarial robustness, highlighting the need for more dependable adversarial training methods for SNNs.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) utilize spike-based activations to mimic the brain's energy-efficient information processing. However, the binary and discontinuous nature of spike activations causes vanishing gradients, making adversarial robustness evaluation via gradient descent unreliable. While improved surrogate gradient methods have been proposed, their effectiveness under strong adversarial attacks remains unclear. We propose a more reliable framework for evaluating SNN adversarial robustness. We theoretically analyze the degree of gradient vanishing in surrogate gradients and introduce the Adaptive Sharpness Surrogate Gradient (ASSG), which adaptively evolves the shape of the surrogate function according to the input distribution during attack iterations, thereby enhancing gradient accuracy while mitigating gradient vanishing. In addition, we design an adversarial attack with adaptive step size under the $L_\infty$ constraint-Stable Adaptive Projected Gradient Descent (SA-PGD), achieving faster and more stable convergence under imprecise gradients. Extensive experiments show that our approach substantially increases attack success rates across diverse adversarial training schemes, SNN architectures and neuron models, providing a more generalized and reliable evaluation of SNN adversarial robustness. The experimental results further reveal that the robustness of current SNNs has been significantly overestimated and highlighting the need for more dependable adversarial training methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior time-series forecasting work focused mostly on encoder design, treating prediction and training as separate or secondary, while effective modeling needs holistic consideration of encoding, prediction, and training.

Method: A unified encoder-decoder architecture (TimePerceiver) generalized to handle diverse temporal objectives (extrapolation, interpolation, imputation): latent bottleneck representations for encoding (capturing temporal/cross-channel dependencies) and learnable queries for decoding (retrieving target info).

Result: Extensive experiments show TimePerceiver consistently and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art baselines across various benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: TimePerceiver's unified framework addresses gaps in prior work by integrating encoding, prediction, and training, achieving superior performance on diverse time-series forecasting tasks.

Abstract: In machine learning, effective modeling requires a holistic consideration of how to encode inputs, make predictions (i.e., decoding), and train the model. However, in time-series forecasting, prior work has predominantly focused on encoder design, often treating prediction and training as separate or secondary concerns. In this paper, we propose TimePerceiver, a unified encoder-decoder forecasting framework that is tightly aligned with an effective training strategy. To be specific, we first generalize the forecasting task to include diverse temporal prediction objectives such as extrapolation, interpolation, and imputation. Since this generalization requires handling input and target segments that are arbitrarily positioned along the temporal axis, we design a novel encoder-decoder architecture that can flexibly perceive and adapt to these varying positions. For encoding, we introduce a set of latent bottleneck representations that can interact with all input segments to jointly capture temporal and cross-channel dependencies. For decoding, we leverage learnable queries corresponding to target timestamps to effectively retrieve relevant information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art baselines across a wide range of benchmark datasets.

### [107] [On Admissible Rank-based Input Normalization Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22587)
*Taeyun Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the lack of formal structural conditions for stable rank-based input normalization operators, shows existing differentiable sorting/ranking operators fail due to structural issues, proposes three axioms for valid operators, proves their necessary factorization, constructs a minimal operator, and empirically validates non-trivial constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formally pin down the structural conditions that a rank-based normalization operator must satisfy to remain stable under invariances like monotone transformations and batch-to-batch variation, as existing operators lack such formalization and are unstable.

Method: The paper proposes three axioms formalizing minimal invariance and stability properties for rank-based normalization operators, proves that any operator satisfying these axioms must factor into a feature-wise rank representation plus a monotone and Lipschitz-continuous scalarization map, and constructs a minimal operator meeting these criteria.

Result: The paper shows widely used differentiable sorting/ranking operators are intrinsically unstable under strictly monotone transformations, mini-batch composition shifts, and tiny input perturbations due to structural design; the constructed minimal operator meets the axiomatic criteria, and empirical results demonstrate non-trivial constraints in realistic setups.

Conclusion: The results sharply delineate the design space of valid rank-based normalization operators and formally separate them from existing continuous-relaxation-based sorting methods.

Abstract: Rank-based input normalization is a workhorse of modern machine learning, prized for its robustness to scale, monotone transformations, and batch-to-batch variation. In many real systems, the ordering of feature values matters far more than their raw magnitudes - yet the structural conditions that a rank-based normalization operator must satisfy to remain stable under these invariances have never been formally pinned down.
  We show that widely used differentiable sorting and ranking operators fundamentally fail these criteria. Because they rely on value gaps and batch-level pairwise interactions, they are intrinsically unstable under strictly monotone transformations, shifts in mini-batch composition, and even tiny input perturbations. Crucially, these failures stem from the operators' structural design, not from incidental implementation choices.
  To address this, we propose three axioms that formalize the minimal invariance and stability properties required of rank-based input normalization. We prove that any operator satisfying these axioms must factor into (i) a feature-wise rank representation and (ii) a scalarization map that is both monotone and Lipschitz-continuous. We then construct a minimal operator that meets these criteria and empirically show that the resulting constraints are non-trivial in realistic setups. Together, our results sharply delineate the design space of valid rank-based normalization operators and formally separate them from existing continuous-relaxation-based sorting methods.

TL;DR: This study analyzes over 2,500 U.S. AV crash records (SAE Levels 2 and 4) using a two-stage data mining framework (K-means clustering followed by Association Rule Mining) to uncover crash dynamics, providing guidance for developers, regulators, and policymakers to reduce crash risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about AV safety and operational reliability in mixed traffic environments, given that past research on AV crashes relies on small, California-centered datasets and lacks focus on crash trends across different SAE automation levels.

Method: A two-stage data mining framework: first, K-means clustering segments crash records into 4 behavioral clusters based on temporal, spatial, and environmental factors; then, Association Rule Mining (ARM) extracts multivariate relationships between crash patterns and contributors (lighting, surface, vehicle dynamics, environmental conditions) within each cluster.

Result: The framework uncovers underlying crash dynamics from a large, national dataset covering multiple SAE levels, yielding interpretable insights into crash patterns and their contributors.

Conclusion: The insights from the analysis provide actionable guidance for AV developers, safety regulators, and policymakers to formulate deployment strategies and minimize crash risks.

Abstract: Automated Vehicles (AV) hold potential to reduce or eliminate human driving errors, enhance traffic safety, and support sustainable mobility. Recently, crash data has increasingly revealed that AV behavior can deviate from expected safety outcomes, raising concerns about the technology's safety and operational reliability in mixed traffic environments. While past research has investigated AV crash, most studies rely on small-size California-centered datasets, with a limited focus on understanding crash trends across various SAE Levels of automation. This study analyzes over 2,500 AV crash records from the United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), covering SAE Levels 2 and 4, to uncover underlying crash dynamics. A two-stage data mining framework is developed. K-means clustering is first applied to segment crash records into 4 distinct behavioral clusters based on temporal, spatial, and environmental factors. Then, Association Rule Mining (ARM) is used to extract interpretable multivariate relationships between crash patterns and crash contributors including lighting conditions, surface condition, vehicle dynamics, and environmental conditions within each cluster. These insights provide actionable guidance for AV developers, safety regulators, and policymakers in formulating AV deployment strategies and minimizing crash risks.

Motivation: Physics-based pipelines for generating low-energy conformers are computationally demanding; current learning-based methods either lack reliable energy calibration (generative models) or fail to represent ensemble variability (deterministic predictors).

Method: EnFlow couples flow matching (FM) with an explicitly learned energy model via an energy-guided sampling scheme along a non-Gaussian FM path, incorporating energy-gradient guidance during sampling and using the learned energy function for ensemble ranking.

Result: Extensive experiments on GEOM-QM9 and GEOM-Drugs show EnFlow improves generation metrics with 1--2 ODE steps and reduces ground-state prediction errors compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: EnFlow effectively addresses the limitations of existing approaches, providing a unified solution for generating accurate low-energy conformer ensembles and identifying ground states efficiently.

Abstract: Generating low-energy conformer ensembles and identifying ground-state conformations from molecular graphs remain computationally demanding with physics-based pipelines. Current learning-based approaches often suffer from a fragmented paradigm: generative models capture diversity but lack reliable energy calibration, whereas deterministic predictors target a single structure and fail to represent ensemble variability. Here we present EnFlow, a unified framework that couples flow matching (FM) with an explicitly learned energy model through an energy-guided sampling scheme defined along a non-Gaussian FM path. By incorporating energy-gradient guidance during sampling, our method steers trajectories toward lower-energy regions, substantially improving conformational fidelity, particularly in the few-step regime. The learned energy function further enables efficient energy-based ranking of generated ensembles for accurate ground-state identification. Extensive experiments on GEOM-QM9 and GEOM-Drugs demonstrate that EnFlow simultaneously improves generation metrics with 1--2 ODE-steps and reduces ground-state prediction errors compared with state-of-the-art methods.

### [110] [Cryptocurrency Price Prediction Using Parallel Gated Recurrent Units](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22599)
*Milad Asadpour,Alireza Rezaee,Farshid Hajati*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new deep model called Parallel Gated Recurrent Units (PGRU) for cryptocurrency price prediction, which uses parallel recurrent neural networks with distinct price-related features and combines their outputs to achieve higher accuracy and efficiency than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cryptocurrency markets have grown rapidly, but price forecasting remains a key challenge for investors; existing methods may lack accuracy or efficiency, prompting the need for a better approach.

Method: The proposed PGRU model uses parallel, independent recurrent neural networks that take different price-related features as inputs, then combines their outputs via another neural network to predict future cryptocurrency prices.

Result: Experimental results show the PGRU model achieves MAPE of 3.243% (window length 20) and 2.641% (window length15), outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency with fewer inputs and lower computational cost.

Conclusion: The PGRU model is an effective and efficient solution for cryptocurrency price prediction, offering improved performance over existing methods.

Abstract: According to the advent of cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin, many investments and businesses are now conducted online through cryptocurrencies. Among them, Bitcoin uses blockchain technology to make transactions secure, transparent, traceable, and immutable. It also exhibits significant price fluctuations and performance, which has attracted substantial attention, especially in financial sectors. Consequently, a wide range of investors and individuals have turned to investing in the cryptocurrency market. One of the most important challenges in economics is price forecasting for future trades. Cryptocurrencies are no exception, and investors are looking for methods to predict prices; various theories and methods have been proposed in this field. This paper presents a new deep model, called \emph{Parallel Gated Recurrent Units} (PGRU), for cryptocurrency price prediction. In this model, recurrent neural networks forecast prices in a parallel and independent way. The parallel networks utilize different inputs, each representing distinct price-related features. Finally, the outputs of the parallel networks are combined by a neural network to forecast the future price of cryptocurrencies. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model achieves mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) of 3.243% and 2.641% for window lengths 20 and 15, respectively. Our method therefore attains higher accuracy and efficiency with fewer input data and lower computational cost compared to existing methods.

*Hesam Taghipour,Alireza Rezaee,Farshid Hajati*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an LSTM-MLP model optimized by Gray Wolf Optimization (GWO) for daily and monthly gold price forecasting, using macroeconomic, energy, stock, and currency data from 2010-2021; the model achieves low MAE values and a trading strategy based on it yields 171% return in three months.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate forecasting of the complex global gold market (influenced by economic and political factors) is challenging, and a reliable model would benefit market participants.

Method: Two LSTM networks handle daily/monthly forecasting, their results are integrated into an MLP for final next-day price prediction; GWO optimizes internal neurons of each network to minimize RMSE.

Result: The LSTM-MLP model predicts daily closing gold price with MAE $0.21 and next month's price with MAE $22.23; a trading strategy based on the model achieves a 171% return over three months.

Conclusion: The proposed LSTM-MLP model optimized by GWO is effective for gold price forecasting and can support profitable trading strategies.

Abstract: The global gold market, by its fundamentals, has long been home to many financial institutions, banks, governments, funds, and micro-investors. Due to the inherent complexity and relationship between important economic and political components, accurate forecasting of financial markets has always been challenging. Therefore, providing a model that can accurately predict the future of the markets is very important and will be of great benefit to their developers. In this paper, an artificial intelligence-based algorithm for daily and monthly gold forecasting is presented. Two Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are responsible for daily and monthly forecasting, the results of which are integrated into a Multilayer perceptrons (MLP) network and provide the final forecast of the next day prices. The algorithm forecasts the highest, lowest, and closing prices on the daily and monthly time frame. Based on these forecasts, a trading strategy for live market trading was developed, according to which the proposed model had a return of 171% in three months. Also, the number of internal neurons in each network is optimized by the Gray Wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm based on the least RMSE error. The dataset was collected between 2010 and 2021 and includes data on macroeconomic, energy markets, stocks, and currency status of developed countries. Our proposed LSTM-MLP model predicted the daily closing price of gold with the Mean absolute error (MAE) of $ 0.21 and the next month's price with $ 22.23.

### [112] [Communication Compression for Distributed Learning with Aggregate and Server-Guided Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22623)
*Tomas Ortega,Chun-Yin Huang,Xiaoxiao Li,Hamid Jafarkhani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes two frameworks (CAFe and CAFe-S) to address communication cost bottlenecks in Federated Learning (FL) using biased compression without client-side state or control variates, proving their convergence superiority and validating via experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the communication cost bottleneck in FL (especially uplink client-to-server updates constrained by asymmetric edge bandwidth) while avoiding privacy violations and incompatibility with stateless clients caused by standard error feedback's client-specific control variates.

Method: 1. Compressed Aggregate Feedback (CAFe): Uses the globally aggregated update from the previous round as a shared control variate for all clients. 2. Server-Guided Compressed Aggregate Feedback (CAFe-S): Extends CAFe by using a server-generated candidate update (from its small private dataset) as a more accurate predictor. Analytical convergence proofs for both in non-convex regimes with bounded gradient dissimilarity.

Result: CAFe outperforms Distributed Compressed Gradient Descent (DCGD) with biased compression in non-convex settings. CAFe-S converges to a stationary point with a rate that improves as the server's data becomes more representative. Experimental results in FL scenarios validate the superiority over existing compression schemes.

Conclusion: The proposed CAFe and CAFe-S frameworks effectively reduce communication costs in FL using biased compression without client-side state/control variates, with theoretical convergence guarantees and experimental validation of their superiority over existing methods.

Abstract: Distributed learning, particularly Federated Learning (FL), faces a significant bottleneck in the communication cost, particularly the uplink transmission of client-to-server updates, which is often constrained by asymmetric bandwidth limits at the edge. Biased compression techniques are effective in practice, but require error feedback mechanisms to provide theoretical guarantees and to ensure convergence when compression is aggressive. Standard error feedback, however, relies on client-specific control variates, which violates user privacy and is incompatible with stateless clients common in large-scale FL. This paper proposes two novel frameworks that enable biased compression without client-side state or control variates. The first, Compressed Aggregate Feedback (CAFe), uses the globally aggregated update from the previous round as a shared control variate for all clients. The second, Server-Guided Compressed Aggregate Feedback (CAFe-S), extends this idea to scenarios where the server possesses a small private dataset; it generates a server-guided candidate update to be used as a more accurate predictor. We consider Distributed Gradient Descent (DGD) as a representative algorithm and analytically prove CAFe's superiority to Distributed Compressed Gradient Descent (DCGD) with biased compression in the non-convex regime with bounded gradient dissimilarity. We further prove that CAFe-S converges to a stationary point, with a rate that improves as the server's data become more representative. Experimental results in FL scenarios validate the superiority of our approaches over existing compression schemes.

*Shuyu Gan,James Mooney,Pan Hao,Renxiang Wang,Mingyi Hong,Qianwen Wang,Dongyeop Kang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Selective Test-Time Scaling (Selective TTS), a process-based refinement framework for multi-agent pipelines to address the problem of error accumulation in judge-based refinement for tasks without verifiable final rewards; it's validated on a data science pipeline task, showing improved insight quality and reduced variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many real-world multi-stage pipeline tasks lack verifiable final rewards or sufficient data for robust reward models, leading to error accumulation in judge-based refinement over stages.

Method: Selective TTS distributes compute across stages in multi-agent pipelines and prunes low-quality branches early using process-specific judges. It's tested on an end-to-end multi-agent data science pipeline (generating charts and reports) with an LLM-based judge aligned with human experts (Kendall's τ=0.55).

Result: Under a fixed compute budget, Selective TTS increases mean insight quality scores from 61.64 to 65.86 and reduces variance.

Conclusion: Selective TTS is a promising first step toward scaling complex, open-ended tasks with unverifiable rewards (e.g., scientific discovery, story generation).

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents can increasingly automate complex reasoning through Test-Time Scaling (TTS), iterative refinement guided by reward signals. However, many real-world tasks involve multi-stage pipeline whose final outcomes lack verifiable rewards or sufficient data to train robust reward models, making judge-based refinement prone to accumulate error over stages. We propose Selective TTS, a process-based refinement framework that scales inference across different stages in multi-agent pipeline, instead of repeated refinement over time by prior work. By distributing compute across stages and pruning low-quality branches early using process-specific judges, Selective TTS mitigates the judge drift and stabilizes refinement. Grounded in the data science pipeline, we build an end-to-end multi-agent pipeline for generating visually insightful charts and report of given dataset, and design a reliable LLM-based judge model, aligned with human experts (Kendall's τ=0.55). Our proposed selective TTS then improves insight quality under a fixed compute budget, increasing mean scores from 61.64 to 65.86 while reducing variance. We hope our findings serve as the first step toward to scaling complex, open-ended tasks with unverifiable rewards, such as scientific discovery and story generation.

Motivation: Recent work has explored quantum models for learning statistical properties of fluid systems, but the combination of discrete latent space compression with quantum generative sampling for CFD remains unexplored.

Method: The authors developed a GPU-accelerated LBM simulator to generate fluid vorticity fields, compressed into a discrete 7-dimensional latent space using VQ-VAE, then compared quantum generative approaches (QCBM and QGAN) against classical LSTM baseline.

Result: Under experimental conditions, both quantum models produced samples with lower average minimum distances to the true distribution compared to LSTM, with QCBM achieving the most favorable metrics.

Abstract: This paper presents the first application of quantum generative models to learned latent space representations of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) data. While recent work has explored quantum models for learning statistical properties of fluid systems, the combination of discrete latent space compression with quantum generative sampling for CFD remains unexplored. We develop a GPU-accelerated Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) simulator to generate fluid vorticity fields, which are compressed into a discrete 7-dimensional latent space using a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE). The central contribution is a comparative analysis of quantum and classical generative approaches for modeling this physics-derived latent distribution: we evaluate a Quantum Circuit Born Machine (QCBM) and Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN) against a classical Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) baseline. Under our experimental conditions, both quantum models produced samples with lower average minimum distances to the true distribution compared to the LSTM, with the QCBM achieving the most favorable metrics. This work provides: (1)~a complete open-source pipeline bridging CFD simulation and quantum machine learning, (2)~the first empirical study of quantum generative modeling on compressed latent representations of physics simulations, and (3)~a foundation for future rigorous investigation at this intersection.

*Donghwa Kang,Shana Moothedath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies decentralized multi-task representation learning with low-rank feature sharing, proposes an alternating projected gradient minimization algorithm with provable guarantees, and shows its communication complexity is independent of target accuracy, outperforming centralized federated approaches in some regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized multi-task representation learning has been well-studied, but decentralized methods are underexplored; the goal is to recover a low-rank feature matrix in a decentralized setting where task data are distributed across nodes with constrained communication.

Method: An alternating projected gradient and minimization algorithm is proposed for decentralized multi-task representation learning with low-rank feature structure.

Result: The algorithm has provable accuracy guarantees; comprehensive characterizations of time, communication, and sample complexities are provided, with communication complexity independent of target accuracy. Numerical simulations validate theoretical results and show decentralized learning outperforms centralized federated approaches in some regimes.

Conclusion: Decentralized multi-task representation learning with the proposed algorithm is effective, offering advantages in communication cost and performance over prior methods in certain scenarios.

Abstract: Representation learning is a widely adopted framework for learning in data-scarce environments, aiming to extract common features from related tasks. While centralized approaches have been extensively studied, decentralized methods remain largely underexplored. We study decentralized multi-task representation learning in which the features share a low-rank structure. We consider multiple tasks, each with a finite number of data samples, where the observations follow a linear model with task-specific parameters. In the decentralized setting, task data are distributed across multiple nodes, and information exchange between nodes is constrained by a communication network. The goal is to recover the underlying feature matrix whose rank is much smaller than both the parameter dimension and the number of tasks. We propose a new alternating projected gradient and minimization algorithm with provable accuracy guarantees. We provide comprehensive characterizations of the time, communication, and sample complexities. Importantly, the communication complexity is independent of the target accuracy, which significantly reduces communication cost compared to prior methods. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical analysis across different dimensions and network topologies, and demonstrate regimes in which decentralized learning outperforms centralized federated approaches.

### [116] [Learning with the $p$-adics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22692)
*André F. T. Martins*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores using p-adic numbers (a non-archimedean, hierarchical field) as an alternative to real numbers for machine learning frameworks, establishes basic models/algorithms for classification, regression, and representation learning with p-adics, shows that Quillian semantic networks can be compactly represented as p-adic linear networks (impossible with reals), and discusses open problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether the field of real numbers (used in most ML frameworks) is the only viable choice, and to explore the potential of p-adic numbers (with hierarchical structure and infinite string interpretation) for code theory and hierarchical representation learning.

Method: The paper conducts exploratory theoretical work to establish building blocks for classification, regression, and representation learning using p-adic numbers; constructs a p-adic linear network to represent Quillian semantic networks (a task not feasible with real numbers).

Result: The paper successfully establishes basic models and algorithms for ML with p-adic numbers, and demonstrates that Quillian semantic networks can be compactly represented as p-adic linear networks (a construction impossible with real numbers).

Conclusion: The p-adic number framework offers a new direction for machine learning, with promising applications in hierarchical representation learning; open problems and future research opportunities exist in this emerging area.

Abstract: Existing machine learning frameworks operate over the field of real numbers ($\mathbb{R}$) and learn representations in real (Euclidean or Hilbert) vector spaces (e.g., $\mathbb{R}^d$). Their underlying geometric properties align well with intuitive concepts such as linear separability, minimum enclosing balls, and subspace projection; and basic calculus provides a toolbox for learning through gradient-based optimization.
  But is this the only possible choice? In this paper, we study the suitability of a radically different field as an alternative to $\mathbb{R}$ -- the ultrametric and non-archimedean space of $p$-adic numbers, $\mathbb{Q}_p$. The hierarchical structure of the $p$-adics and their interpretation as infinite strings make them an appealing tool for code theory and hierarchical representation learning. Our exploratory theoretical work establishes the building blocks for classification, regression, and representation learning with the $p$-adics, providing learning models and algorithms. We illustrate how simple Quillian semantic networks can be represented as a compact $p$-adic linear network, a construction which is not possible with the field of reals. We finish by discussing open problems and opportunities for future research enabled by this new framework.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a learning-based framework to predict power outages from extreme events, using multi-source data (EAGLE-I records, weather, socio-economic, infrastructure, seasonal) and evaluating four ML models; LSTM performs best, with economic/infrastructure development linked to lower outages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To predict power outages caused by low-probability, high-consequence extreme events, and understand community vulnerability factors affecting outage risk.

Method: Integrate EAGLE-I outage records (2014-2024) with weather, socio-economic, infrastructure, and seasonal event data; evaluate four machine learning models: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).

Result: The LSTM network achieves the lowest prediction error among the four models; stronger economic conditions and more developed infrastructure are associated with lower outage occurrence.

Conclusion: The learning-based framework effectively predicts power outages from extreme events, with LSTM as the optimal model, and highlights the role of economic/infrastructure factors in reducing outage risk.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel learning-based framework for predicting power outages caused by extreme events. The proposed approach specifically targets low-probability, high-consequence outage scenarios and leverages a comprehensive set of features derived from publicly available data sources. We integrate EAGLE-I outage records (2014-2024) with weather, socio-economic, infrastructure, and seasonal event data. Incorporating social and demographic indicators reveals underlying patterns of community vulnerability and provides a clearer understanding of outage risk during extreme conditions. Four machine learning models (Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)) are evaluated. Experimental validation is performed on a large-scale dataset covering counties in the lower peninsula of Michigan. Among all models tested, the LSTM network achieves the lowest prediction error. Additionally, the results demonstrate that stronger economic conditions and more developed infrastructure are associated with lower outage occurrence.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the design space of deep learning architectures for time series forecasting, discussing design dimensions, trade-offs, and overlooked implementation details, and proposes an auxiliary forecasting model card to characterize architectures based on key design choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty in assessing which components contribute significantly to the performance of deep learning models for time series forecasting due to the large number of newly proposed architectures and often contradictory empirical results.

Method: The paper discusses design dimensions and trade-offs in deep learning architectures for time series forecasting, assesses the application of principles like locality and globality to recent models, examines overlooked implementation details, and proposes an auxiliary forecasting model card.

Result: Accounting for aspects like locality and globality is more relevant for accurate results than adopting specific sequence modeling layers; simple, well-designed architectures can match state-of-the-art performance; overlooked implementation details fundamentally change the forecasting method class and drastically affect empirical results.

Conclusion: Current faulty benchmarking practices need rethinking, and focus should be on foundational aspects of the forecasting problem when designing architectures; the proposed auxiliary forecasting model card helps characterize existing and new architectures based on key design choices.

Abstract: Deep learning models have grown increasingly popular in time series applications. However, the large quantity of newly proposed architectures, together with often contradictory empirical results, makes it difficult to assess which components contribute significantly to final performance. We aim to make sense of the current design space of deep learning architectures for time series forecasting by discussing the design dimensions and trade-offs that can explain, often unexpected, observed results. This paper discusses the necessity of grounding model design on principles for forecasting groups of time series and how such principles can be applied to current models. In particular, we assess how concepts such as locality and globality apply to recent forecasting architectures. We show that accounting for these aspects can be more relevant for achieving accurate results than adopting specific sequence modeling layers and that simple, well-designed forecasting architectures can often match the state of the art. We discuss how overlooked implementation details in existing architectures (1) fundamentally change the class of the resulting forecasting method and (2) drastically affect the observed empirical results. Our results call for rethinking current faulty benchmarking practices and the need to focus on the foundational aspects of the forecasting problem when designing architectures. As a step in this direction, we propose an auxiliary forecasting model card, whose fields serve to characterize existing and new forecasting architectures based on key design choices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses scalability challenges in long-horizon RL for LLMs due to unbounded context growth via context folding, introducing FoldAct framework to solve policy-dependent non-stationary observation issues, achieving stable training and 5.19× speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon RL for LLMs faces scalability challenges from unbounded context growth; existing context folding methods treat summaries as standard actions, leading to policy-dependent non-stationary observations which cause gradient dilution, self-conditioning-induced training collapse, and high computational cost.

Method: FoldAct framework with three innovations: separated loss computation for summary and action tokens, full context consistency loss to reduce distribution shift, and selective segment training to cut computational cost.

Result: FoldAct enables stable training of long-horizon search agents with context folding, improves training efficiency by 5.19× speedup while addressing non-stationary observation problem.

Conclusion: FoldAct effectively addresses the key challenges of context folding in long-horizon RL for LLMs, providing a stable and efficient solution.

Abstract: Long-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models faces critical scalability challenges from unbounded context growth, leading to context folding methods that compress interaction history during task execution. However, existing approaches treat summary actions as standard actions, overlooking that summaries fundamentally modify the agent's future observation space, creating a policy-dependent, non-stationary observation distribution that violates core RL assumptions. This introduces three fundamental challenges: (1) gradient dilution where summary tokens receive insufficient training signal, (2) self-conditioning where policy updates change summary distributions, creating a vicious cycle of training collapse, and (3) computational cost from processing unique contexts at each turn. We introduce \textbf{FoldAct}\footnote{https://github.com/SHAO-Jiaqi757/FoldAct}, a framework that explicitly addresses these challenges through three key innovations: separated loss computation for independent gradient signals on summary and action tokens, full context consistency loss to reduce distribution shift, and selective segment training to reduce computational cost. Our method enables stable training of long-horizon search agents with context folding, addressing the non-stationary observation problem while improving training efficiency with 5.19$\times$ speedup.

TL;DR: The paper tests multi-task learning (MTL) for predicting three alloy properties (electrical resistivity, Vickers hardness, amorphous-forming ability) using 54k samples, finding MTL degrades regression performance but improves classification recall, recommending independent models for regression and MTL for classification when recall is critical.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To verify if related material properties share underlying physics that can be leveraged via MTL for better predictions of alloy properties.

Method: Simultaneously predict three alloy properties (electrical resistivity, Vickers hardness, amorphous-forming ability) using 54,028 samples; compare single-task models against standard and structured MTL.

Result: MTL significantly degrades regression performance (resistivity R² from 0.897 to 0.844; hardness R² from0.832 to0.694, p<0.01) but improves classification (amorphous F1 from 0.703 to0.744, p<0.05; recall +17%); near-zero inter-task weights indicate property independence; regression failure due to negative transfer from severe data imbalance (52k vs.800 samples).

Conclusion: Use independent models for precise regression tasks; reserve MTL for classification tasks where recall is critical.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) assumes related material properties share underlying physics that can be leveraged for better predictions. We test this by simultaneously predicting electrical resistivity, Vickers hardness, and amorphous-forming ability using 54,028 alloy samples. We compare single-task models against standard and structured MTL. Results reveal a striking dichotomy: MTL significantly degrades regression performance (resistivity $R^2$: 0.897 $\to$ 0.844; hardness $R^2$: 0.832 $\to$ 0.694, $p < 0.01$) but improves classification (amorphous F1: 0.703 $\to$ 0.744, $p < 0.05$; recall +17%). Analysis shows near-zero inter-task weights, indicating property independence. Regression failure is attributed to negative transfer caused by severe data imbalance (52k vs. 800 samples). We recommend independent models for precise regression, while reserving MTL for classification tasks where recall is critical.

*Rihong Qiu,Zhibang Yang,Xinke Jiang,Weibin Liao,Xin Gao,Xu Chu,Junfeng Zhao,Yasha Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HEROSQL is a hierarchical SQL representation approach integrating global intent (Logical Plans) and local details (Abstract Syntax Trees) with a Nested Message Passing Neural Network for semantic validation in Text-to-SQL, outperforming SOTA methods in detecting inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Text-to-SQL validation approaches focus only on syntactic correctness, neglecting semantic validation (misalignments between questions and SQL), leading to two challenges: capturing both global user intent and SQL structural details, and constructing high-quality fine-grained sub-SQL annotations.

Method: HEROSQL uses a hierarchical SQL representation combining Logical Plans (global intent) and Abstract Syntax Trees (local details), employs a Nested Message Passing Neural Network to capture relational info and aggregate schema-guided semantics, and an AST-driven sub-SQL augmentation strategy for high-quality negative samples.

Result: Extensive experiments on Text-to-SQL validation benchmarks (in-domain and out-of-domain) show HEROSQL outperforms SOTA methods, with an average 9.40% improvement in AUPRC and 12.35% in AUROC for identifying semantic inconsistencies; it excels at fine-grained error detection and provides granular feedback to LLMs.

Conclusion: HEROSQL enhances the reliability and interpretability of data querying platforms by effectively addressing semantic validation challenges in Text-to-SQL systems through hierarchical representation, nested message passing, and AST-driven augmentation.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL translates natural language questions into SQL statements grounded in a target database schema. Ensuring the reliability and executability of such systems requires validating generated SQL, but most existing approaches focus only on syntactic correctness, with few addressing semantic validation (detecting misalignments between questions and SQL). As a consequence, effective semantic validation still faces two key challenges: capturing both global user intent and SQL structural details, and constructing high-quality fine-grained sub-SQL annotations. To tackle these, we introduce HEROSQL, a hierarchical SQL representation approach that integrates global intent (via Logical Plans, LPs) and local details (via Abstract Syntax Trees, ASTs). To enable better information propagation, we employ a Nested Message Passing Neural Network (NMPNN) to capture inherent relational information in SQL and aggregate schema-guided semantics across LPs and ASTs. Additionally, to generate high-quality negative samples, we propose an AST-driven sub-SQL augmentation strategy, supporting robust optimization of fine-grained semantic inconsistencies. Extensive experiments conducted on Text-to-SQL validation benchmarks (both in-domain and out-of-domain settings) demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average 9.40% improvement of AUPRC and 12.35% of AUROC in identifying semantic inconsistencies. It excels at detecting fine-grained semantic errors, provides large language models with more granular feedback, and ultimately enhances the reliability and interpretability of data querying platforms.

*Chumeng Liang,Zhanyang Jin,Zahaib Akhtar,Mona Pereira,Haofei Yu,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes GraphLogDebugger, a dynamic graph-based framework for debugging text-enriched tabular logs, which uses heterogeneous nodes and edges to model system evolution and a simple dynamic GNN to outperform LLMs in flexibility and scalability, validated on real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent methods for processing text-enriched tabular log data overly rely on large language models (LLMs) and other heavy-load models, leading to limited flexibility and scalability.

Method: The framework GraphLogDebugger constructs heterogeneous nodes for objects and events, connects them with edges to model the system as an evolving dynamic graph, and uses a simple dynamic Graph Neural Network (GNN) for debugging.

Result: Experimental results on real-world log datasets of computer systems and academic papers show that the proposed dynamic GNN outperforms LLMs in debugging tabular logs.

Conclusion: GraphLogDebugger provides an effective alternative to LLM-based methods for tabular log debugging with better flexibility and scalability.

Abstract: Tabular log abstracts objects and events in the real-world system and reports their updates to reflect the change of the system, where one can detect real-world inconsistencies efficiently by debugging corresponding log entries. However, recent advances in processing text-enriched tabular log data overly depend on large language models (LLMs) and other heavy-load models, thus suffering from limited flexibility and scalability. This paper proposes a new framework, GraphLogDebugger, to debug tabular log based on dynamic graphs. By constructing heterogeneous nodes for objects and events and connecting node-wise edges, the framework recovers the system behind the tabular log as an evolving dynamic graph. With the help of our dynamic graph modeling, a simple dynamic Graph Neural Network (GNN) is representative enough to outperform LLMs in debugging tabular log, which is validated by experimental results on real-world log datasets of computer systems and academic papers.

Abstract: We study the pricing behavior of third-party platforms facing strategic agents. Assuming the platform is a revenue maximizer, it observes market features that generally affect demand. Since only the equilibrium price and quantity are observable, this presents a general demand learning problem under confounding. Mathematically, we develop an algorithm with optimal regret of $\Tilde{\cO}(\sqrt{T}\wedgeσ_S^{-2})$. Our results reveal that supply-side noise fundamentally affects the learnability of demand, leading to a phase transition in regret. Technically, we show that non-i.i.d. actions can serve as instrumental variables for learning demand. We also propose a novel homeomorphic construction that allows us to establish estimation bounds without assuming star-shapedness, providing the first efficiency guarantee for learning demand with deep neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach through simulations and real-world data from Zomato and Lyft.

### [124] [A Micro-Macro Machine Learning Framework for Predicting Childhood Obesity Risk Using NHANES and Environmental Determinants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22758)
*Eswarasanthosh Kumar Mamillapalli,Nishtha Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a micro-macro machine learning framework integrating individual-level NHANES data and macro-level environmental features (food access, air quality, socioeconomic vulnerability) to predict childhood obesity in the US, finding XGBoost performs best and showing geographic alignment between high environmental burden and obesity risk, contributing a scalable pipeline for public health informatics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional epidemiological studies analyze individual, household, and environmental risk factors for childhood obesity independently, limiting insights into how structural environmental conditions interact with individual characteristics to influence health outcomes.

Method: A micro-macro machine learning framework integrating (1) individual-level anthropometric and socioeconomic data from NHANES and (2) macro-level structural environment features (food access, air quality, socioeconomic vulnerability from USDA and EPA datasets) was used. Four models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM) were trained to predict obesity; a composite environmental vulnerability index (EnvScore) at state level was constructed; multi-level geographic comparison was done.

Result: XGBoost achieved the strongest performance in predicting obesity. Multi-level comparison revealed strong geographic similarity between states with high environmental burden and nationally predicted micro-level obesity risk distribution.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates feasibility of integrating multi-scale datasets to identify environment-driven disparities in obesity risk, providing a scalable, data-driven, multi-level modeling pipeline suitable for public health informatics with potential for expansion into causal modeling, intervention planning, and real-time analytics.

Abstract: Childhood obesity remains a major public health challenge in the United States, strongly influenced by a combination of individual-level, household-level, and environmental-level risk factors. Traditional epidemiological studies typically analyze these levels independently, limiting insights into how structural environmental conditions interact with individual-level characteristics to influence health outcomes. In this study, we introduce a micro-macro machine learning framework that integrates (1) individual-level anthropometric and socioeconomic data from NHANES and (2) macro-level structural environment features, including food access, air quality, and socioeconomic vulnerability extracted from USDA and EPA datasets. Four machine learning models Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM were trained to predict obesity using NHANES microdata. XGBoost achieved the strongest performance. A composite environmental vulnerability index (EnvScore) was constructed using normalized indicators from USDA and EPA at the state level. Multi-level comparison revealed strong geographic similarity between states with high environmental burden and the nationally predicted micro-level obesity risk distribution. This demonstrates the feasibility of integrating multi-scale datasets to identify environment-driven disparities in obesity risk. This work contributes a scalable, data-driven, multi-level modeling pipeline suitable for public health informatics, demonstrating strong potential for expansion into causal modeling, intervention planning, and real-time analytics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an integrated framework for LLM fine-tuning that combines the strengths of IL and RL, addressing potential inefficiencies or limitations of using them separately.

Method: The method involves analyzing the gradient of a composite objective that combines trajectory-level KL divergence with task rewards, decomposing it into an analytically computable Dense Gradient (for token-level imitation) and a Monte Carlo estimated Sparse Gradient (for long-horizon reward optimization). The Dense Gradient uses a closed-form logit-level formula for efficient GPU implementation.

### [126] [Understanding the Mechanisms of Fast Hyperparameter Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22768)
*Nikhil Ghosh,Denny Wu,Alberto Bietti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the high cost of hyperparameter (HP) optimization for large deep learning models by exploring scale-aware HP transfer, develops a framework to characterize fast transfer (asymptotically more compute-efficient than direct tuning), analyzes when Maximal Update Parameterization (μP) enables fast transfer, and conjectures a loss trajectory decomposition to explain practical fast transfer with empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing scale of deep learning models makes standard HP optimization prohibitively expensive; scale-aware HPs offer a solution via transferring optimal HPs from small to large models, but the principles governing this transfer are not well understood.

Method: Develop a general conceptual framework defining fast transfer (suboptimality vanishes faster than finite-scale performance gap), prove fast transfer equals useful transfer for compute-optimal grid search; analyze μP's transfer properties in synthetic settings; conjecture a loss trajectory decomposition into width-stable (determines optimal HPs) and width-sensitive (improves with width, weakly perturbs HP optimum) components, then validate empirically across settings including large language model pretraining.

Result: Fast transfer is equivalent to useful transfer for compute-optimal grid search; μP's fast transfer depends on problem structure (works in some synthetic settings, fails in others); empirical evidence supports the loss trajectory decomposition hypothesis across various settings, including large language model pretraining.

Conclusion: Scale-aware HP transfer is a promising approach to reduce optimization costs for large models; the developed framework and loss decomposition hypothesis provide insights into when and why HP transfer works, guiding future work on scale-aware HP design.

Abstract: The growing scale of deep learning models has rendered standard hyperparameter (HP) optimization prohibitively expensive. A promising solution is the use of scale-aware hyperparameters, which can enable direct transfer of optimal HPs from small-scale grid searches to large models with minimal performance loss. To understand the principles governing such transfer strategy, we develop a general conceptual framework for reasoning about HP transfer across scale, characterizing transfer as fast when the suboptimality it induces vanishes asymptotically faster than the finite-scale performance gap. We show formally that fast transfer is equivalent to useful transfer for compute-optimal grid search, meaning that transfer is asymptotically more compute-efficient than direct tuning. While empirical work has found that the Maximal Update Parameterization ($μ$P) exhibits fast transfer when scaling model width, the mechanisms remain poorly understood. We show that this property depends critically on problem structure by presenting synthetic settings where transfer either offers provable computational advantage or fails to outperform direct tuning even under $μ$P. To explain the fast transfer observed in practice, we conjecture that decomposing the optimization trajectory reveals two contributions to loss reduction: (1) a width-stable component that determines the optimal HPs, and (2) a width-sensitive component that improves with width but weakly perturbs the HP optimum. We present empirical evidence for this hypothesis across various settings, including large language model pretraining.

*Xuyan Li,Jie Wang,Zheng Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes GRExplainer, a universal, efficient, and user-friendly explanation method for Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) to address limitations of existing explainability methods (specificity to TGNN types, high computational cost, low user-friendliness). Experiments confirm its superiority over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TGNN explainability methods are tailored to specific TGNN types (restricting generality), have high computational costs (unsuitable for large-scale networks), and overlook structural connectivity/explanations requiring prior knowledge (reducing user-friendliness).

Method: GRExplainer uses node sequences as a unified feature representation (applicable to snapshot/event-based TGNNs), employs breadth-first search and temporal info to construct sequences (reducing redundancy), and uses an RNN-based generative model for automated continuous explanation generation.

Result: Experiments on six real-world datasets with three target TGNNs show GRExplainer outperforms existing baselines in generality, efficiency, and user-friendliness.

Conclusion: GRExplainer is a universal, efficient, user-friendly explanation method for TGNNs that addresses key issues of current approaches and achieves better performance in experiments.

Abstract: Dynamic graphs are widely used to represent evolving real-world networks. Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for processing such graphs, but the lack of transparency and explainability limits their practical adoption. Research on TGNN explainability is still in its early stages and faces several key issues: (i) Current methods are tailored to specific TGNN types, restricting generality. (ii) They suffer from high computational costs, making them unsuitable for large-scale networks. (iii) They often overlook the structural connectivity of explanations and require prior knowledge, reducing user-friendliness. To address these issues, we propose GRExplainer, the first universal, efficient, and user-friendly explanation method for TGNNs. GRExplainer extracts node sequences as a unified feature representation, making it independent of specific input formats and thus applicable to both snapshot-based and event-based TGNNs (the major types of TGNNs). By utilizing breadth-first search and temporal information to construct input node sequences, GRExplainer reduces redundant computation and improves efficiency. To enhance user-friendliness, we design a generative model based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), enabling automated and continuous explanation generation. Experiments on six real-world datasets with three target TGNNs show that GRExplainer outperforms existing baseline methods in generality, efficiency, and user-friendliness.

### [128] [Theoretical Foundations of Scaling Law in Familial Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23407)
*Huan Song,Qingfei Zhao,Ting Long,Shuyu Tian,Hongjun An,Jiawei Shao,Chi Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper extends neural scaling laws to familial models (which generate multiple deployable sub-models from a shared backbone) by introducing Granularity (G) as a key variable alongside model size (N) and training tokens (D). It proposes a unified scaling law L(N,D,G), uses IsoFLOP design to isolate architectural impacts, finds the granularity penalty has a small multiplicative power law exponent, bridging fixed-compute training with dynamic architectures and validating the 'train once, deploy many' paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural scaling laws usually assume a single dense model output, ignoring familial models—transformative for ubiquitous intelligence across heterogeneous device-edge-cloud hierarchies. The goal is to extend scaling laws to capture the 'one-run, many-models' paradigm of familial models.

Method: The paper introduces Granularity (G) as a fundamental scaling variable alongside N and D, proposes a unified functional form L(N,D,G). It uses an IsoFLOP experimental design to strictly isolate architectural impact from computational scale: across fixed budgets, systematically sweep model sizes (N) and granularities (G) while dynamically adjusting tokens (D) to decouple the marginal cost of granularity from scale benefits.

Result: The granularity penalty follows a multiplicative power law with an extremely small exponent.

Conclusion: Theoretically, this bridges fixed-compute training with dynamic architectures. Practically, it validates the 'train once, deploy many' paradigm, showing deployment flexibility is achievable without compromising compute-optimality of dense baselines.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws have become foundational for optimizing large language model (LLM) training, yet they typically assume a single dense model output. This limitation effectively overlooks "Familial models, a transformative paradigm essential for realizing ubiquitous intelligence across heterogeneous device-edge-cloud hierarchies. Transcending static architectures, familial models integrate early exits with relay-style inference to spawn G deployable sub-models from a single shared backbone. In this work, we theoretically and empirically extend the scaling law to capture this "one-run, many-models" paradigm by introducing Granularity (G) as a fundamental scaling variable alongside model size (N) and training tokens (D). To rigorously quantify this relationship, we propose a unified functional form L(N, D, G) and parameterize it using large-scale empirical runs. Specifically, we employ a rigorous IsoFLOP experimental design to strictly isolate architectural impact from computational scale. Across fixed budgets, we systematically sweep model sizes (N) and granularities (G) while dynamically adjusting tokens (D). This approach effectively decouples the marginal cost of granularity from the benefits of scale, ensuring high-fidelity parameterization of our unified scaling law. Our results reveal that the granularity penalty follows a multiplicative power law with an extremely small exponent. Theoretically, this bridges fixed-compute training with dynamic architectures. Practically, it validates the "train once, deploy many" paradigm, demonstrating that deployment flexibility is achievable without compromising the compute-optimality of dense baselines.

*Truong Son Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Schrödinger AI, a unified ML framework inspired by quantum mechanics with three components, showing strong generalization, interpretable semantics, and emergent topology in tasks like semantic manifolds, dynamic reasoning, and modular arithmetic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a physics-driven alternative to conventional cross-entropy training and transformer attention, aiming for robust generalization, interpretable semantics, and emergent topology in machine learning.

Method: Schrödinger AI consists of three tightly coupled components: (1) a time-independent wave-energy solver treating perception/classification as spectral decomposition under a learned Hamiltonian; (2) a time-dependent dynamical solver governing semantic wavefunction evolution for context-aware decision revision; (3) a low-rank operator calculus learning symbolic transformations via quantum-like transition operators.

Result: The framework demonstrates: (a) emergent semantic manifolds reflecting human class relations without explicit supervision; (b) dynamic reasoning adapting to changing environments (e.g., maze navigation with real-time perturbations); (c) exact operator generalization on modular arithmetic across sequences far beyond training length.

Conclusion: Schrödinger AI suggests a new foundational direction for ML where learning is cast as discovering and navigating an underlying semantic energy landscape.

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{Schrödinger AI}, a unified machine learning framework inspired by quantum mechanics. The system is defined by three tightly coupled components: (1) a {time-independent wave-energy solver} that treats perception and classification as spectral decomposition under a learned Hamiltonian; (2) a {time-dependent dynamical solver} governing the evolution of semantic wavefunctions over time, enabling context-aware decision revision, re-routing, and reasoning under environmental changes; and (3) a {low-rank operator calculus} that learns symbolic transformations such as modular arithmetic through learned quantum-like transition operators. Together, these components form a coherent physics-driven alternative to conventional cross-entropy training and transformer attention, providing robust generalization, interpretable semantics, and emergent topology.
  Empirically, Schrödinger AI demonstrates: (a) emergent semantic manifolds that reflect human-conceived class relations without explicit supervision; (b) dynamic reasoning that adapts to changing environments, including maze navigation with real-time potential-field perturbations; and (c) exact operator generalization on modular arithmetic tasks, where the system learns group actions and composes them across sequences far beyond training length. These results suggest a new foundational direction for machine learning, where learning is cast as discovering and navigating an underlying semantic energy landscape.

*Kasra Jalaldoust,Elias Bareinboim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Circuit-TR, an algorithm for zero-shot compositional generalization based on causal transportability theory, which uses causal graphs and discrepancy oracles to learn and compose modules across domains, and also extends to supervised domain adaptation with limited target data, supported by theoretical results and simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generalization across domains by leveraging causal structure to constrain unseen target domains relative to source domains, enabling zero-shot compositional generalization and supervised domain adaptation without explicit causal structure in some cases.

Method: Circuit-TR learns modules (local predictors) from source data using intra-domain causal graphs and inter-domain discrepancy oracles; it transports/composes these modules into a circuit for target prediction if allowed by causal structure, and extends to supervised domain adaptation with limited target data by leveraging circuit transportability.

Result: Theoretical results characterize few-shot learnable tasks via graphical circuit transportability criteria and link few-shot generalizability to circuit size complexity; controlled simulations validate these theoretical findings.

Conclusion: Causal transportability theory can be effectively applied to design algorithms for zero-shot compositional generalization and supervised domain adaptation, with Circuit-TR demonstrating potential in cross-domain generalization tasks supported by theory and experiments.

Abstract: Generalization across the domains is not possible without asserting a structure that constrains the unseen target domain w.r.t. the source domain. Building on causal transportability theory, we design an algorithm for zero-shot compositional generalization which relies on access to qualitative domain knowledge in form of a causal graph for intra-domain structure and discrepancies oracle for inter-domain mechanism sharing. \textit{Circuit-TR} learns a collection of modules (i.e., local predictors) from the source data, and transport/compose them to obtain a circuit for prediction in the target domain if the causal structure licenses. Furthermore, circuit transportability enables us to design a supervised domain adaptation scheme that operates without access to an explicit causal structure, and instead uses limited target data. Our theoretical results characterize classes of few-shot learnable tasks in terms of graphical circuit transportability criteria, and connects few-shot generalizability with the established notion of circuit size complexity; controlled simulations corroborate our theoretical results.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VL-RouterBench is a systematic benchmark for evaluating VLM routing systems, covering 14 datasets, 17 models, and 519k+ sample-model pairs; it evaluates 10 routing methods, finds current routers have gaps to ideal Oracle, and will open-source toolchain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing work lacks a systematic, reproducible benchmark for evaluating vision-language model (VLM) routing systems, which are essential infrastructure now.

Method: Construct VL-RouterBench based on raw VLM inference/scoring logs, with quality/cost matrices over sample-model pairs; evaluation protocol uses average accuracy, cost, throughput, and harmonic mean of normalized cost/accuracy for ranking.

Result: Evaluated 10 routing methods: significant routability gain observed, but best routers still have clear gap to ideal Oracle, suggesting need for better router architecture via finer visual cues and textual structure modeling.

Conclusion: VL-RouterBench fills the benchmark gap for VLM routing systems; open-sourcing toolchain will promote comparability, reproducibility, and deployment in multimodal routing research.

Abstract: Multi-model routing has evolved from an engineering technique into essential infrastructure, yet existing work lacks a systematic, reproducible benchmark for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs). We present VL-RouterBench to assess the overall capability of VLM routing systems systematically. The benchmark is grounded in raw inference and scoring logs from VLMs and constructs quality and cost matrices over sample-model pairs. In scale, VL-RouterBench covers 14 datasets across 3 task groups, totaling 30,540 samples, and includes 15 open-source models and 2 API models, yielding 519,180 sample-model pairs and a total input-output token volume of 34,494,977. The evaluation protocol jointly measures average accuracy, average cost, and throughput, and builds a ranking score from the harmonic mean of normalized cost and accuracy to enable comparison across router configurations and cost budgets. On this benchmark, we evaluate 10 routing methods and baselines and observe a significant routability gain, while the best current routers still show a clear gap to the ideal Oracle, indicating considerable room for improvement in router architecture through finer visual cues and modeling of textual structure. We will open-source the complete data construction and evaluation toolchain to promote comparability, reproducibility, and practical deployment in multimodal routing research.

*Zhou Yang,Edward Dougherty,Chen Zhang,Zhenhe Pan,Fang Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper conducts a retrospective analysis of COVID-19 public health interventions in China using tracking data, NLP, manual curation, and mobility data to identify effective mitigation mechanisms, finding regional differences, quick hospitalization of symptomatic cases, and shifting infection sources over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify the most effective mechanisms in mitigating COVID-19 by comprehensively analyzing public health interventions and transmission patterns in China.

Method: Collect case reports from local health commissions, Chinese CDC, and official social media; apply NLP and manual curation to construct transmission chains; analyze tracking data with Wuhan population mobility data to quantify temporal and spatial spread dynamics.

Result: Larger cities had more infections likely due to social activities; 79% of symptomatic individuals were hospitalized within 5 days of symptom onset; confirmed-case contacts sought admission under 5 days; infection sources shifted from Hubei travel/contact early on to social activities later.

Conclusion: The analysis reveals key transmission patterns and intervention effectiveness, providing insights for mitigating COVID-19 through targeted measures based on regional and temporal dynamics.

Abstract: A comprehensive retrospective analysis of public health interventions, such as large scale testing, quarantining, and contact tracing, can help identify mechanisms most effective in mitigating COVID-19. We investigate China based SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns (e.g., infection type and likely transmission source) using publicly released tracking data. We collect case reports from local health commissions, the Chinese CDC, and official local government social media, then apply NLP and manual curation to construct transmission/tracking chains. We further analyze tracking data together with Wuhan population mobility data to quantify and visualize temporal and spatial spread dynamics. Results indicate substantial regional differences, with larger cities showing more infections, likely driven by social activities. Most symptomatic individuals (79\%) were hospitalized within 5 days of symptom onset, and those with confirmed-case contact sought admission in under 5 days. Infection sources also shifted over time: early cases were largely linked to travel to (or contact with travelers from) Hubei Province, while later transmission was increasingly associated with social activities.

*Shuai Chen,Chen Wang,Ziran Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes SNM-Net, a universal deep learning framework for open-set gas recognition that addresses feature distribution shifts and unknown interference by using geometric decoupling and Mahalanobis distance scoring, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on the Vergara dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: E-nose systems face dual challenges: feature distribution shifts from signal drift and decision failures from unknown interference; existing methods rely on Euclidean distance which fails to account for anisotropic gas feature distributions and dynamic signal intensity variations.

Method: SNM-Net uses a geometric decoupling mechanism (cascaded batch normalization + L2 normalization) to project features onto a unit hypersphere, eliminating signal intensity fluctuations; introduces Mahalanobis distance as scoring mechanism with class-wise statistics for adaptive ellipsoidal decision boundaries; is architecture-agnostic and integrates with CNN, RNN, Transformer backbones.

Result: On the Vergara dataset, Transformer+SNM configuration achieves AUROC of 0.9977 and unknown gas detection rate of 99.57% (TPR at 5% FPR); outperforms state-of-the-art methods like Class Anchor Clustering with 3.0% AUROC improvement and 91.0% standard deviation reduction; shows exceptional robustness across sensor positions with standard deviations below 0.0028.

Conclusion: SNM-Net effectively resolves the trade-off between accuracy and stability for open-set gas recognition, providing a solid technical foundation for industrial E-nose deployment.

Abstract: Electronic nose (E-nose) systems face dual challenges in open-set gas recognition: feature distribution shifts caused by signal drift and decision failures induced by unknown interference. Existing methods predominantly rely on Euclidean distance, failing to adequately account for anisotropic gas feature distributions and dynamic signal intensity variations. To address these issues, this study proposes SNM-Net, a universal deep learning framework for open-set gas recognition. The core innovation lies in a geometric decoupling mechanism achieved through cascaded batch normalization and L2 normalization, which projects high-dimensional features onto a unit hypersphere to eliminate signal intensity fluctuations. Additionally, Mahalanobis distance is introduced as the scoring mechanism, utilizing class-wise statistics to construct adaptive ellipsoidal decision boundaries. SNM-Net is architecture-agnostic and seamlessly integrates with CNN, RNN, and Transformer backbones. Systematic experiments on the Vergara dataset demonstrate that the Transformer+SNM configuration attains near-theoretical performance, achieving an AUROC of 0.9977 and an unknown gas detection rate of 99.57% (TPR at 5% FPR). This performance significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showing a 3.0% improvement in AUROC and a 91.0% reduction in standard deviation compared to Class Anchor Clustering. The framework exhibits exceptional robustness across sensor positions with standard deviations below 0.0028. This work effectively resolves the trade-off between accuracy and stability, providing a solid technical foundation for industrial E-nose deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a scalable, automated method to train language models for generating better research plans by leveraging existing research papers: extracting goals and rubrics, then using reinforcement learning with self-grading; results show 70% expert preference over initial models, 84% rubric approval, and cross-domain generalization (12-22% improvements in medical/arXiv domains).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language models struggle to generate research plans that adhere to all constraints and implicit requirements, limiting their utility as AI co-scientists.

Method: 1. Build a scalable, diverse training corpus by automatically extracting research goals and goal-specific grading rubrics from papers across domains; 2. Train models for research plan generation via reinforcement learning with self-grading (a frozen copy of the initial policy acts as the grader, using rubrics to create a generator-verifier gap without external human supervision).

Result: 1. Human experts prefer plans from finetuned Qwen3-30B-A3B over initial model for 70% of ML research goals; 2. 84% of automatically extracted rubrics are approved by experts; 3. Extending to medical papers and new arXiv preprints yields 12-22% relative improvements and significant cross-domain generalization (effective even in medical research where execution feedback is infeasible).

Conclusion: The proposed scalable, automated training recipe is effective for improving research plan generation models, demonstrating potential as a step towards better general AI co-scientists.

Abstract: AI co-scientists are emerging as a tool to assist human researchers in achieving their research goals. A crucial feature of these AI co-scientists is the ability to generate a research plan given a set of aims and constraints. The plan may be used by researchers for brainstorming, or may even be implemented after further refinement. However, language models currently struggle to generate research plans that follow all constraints and implicit requirements. In this work, we study how to leverage the vast corpus of existing research papers to train language models that generate better research plans. We build a scalable, diverse training corpus by automatically extracting research goals and goal-specific grading rubrics from papers across several domains. We then train models for research plan generation via reinforcement learning with self-grading. A frozen copy of the initial policy acts as the grader during training, with the rubrics creating a generator-verifier gap that enables improvements without external human supervision. To validate this approach, we conduct a study with human experts for machine learning research goals, spanning 225 hours. The experts prefer plans generated by our finetuned Qwen3-30B-A3B model over the initial model for 70% of research goals, and approve 84% of the automatically extracted goal-specific grading rubrics. To assess generality, we also extend our approach to research goals from medical papers, and new arXiv preprints, evaluating with a jury of frontier models. Our finetuning yields 12-22% relative improvements and significant cross-domain generalization, proving effective even in problem settings like medical research where execution feedback is infeasible. Together, these findings demonstrate the potential of a scalable, automated training recipe as a step towards improving general AI co-scientists.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based distillation framework for diffusion models to address slow sampling, achieving better performance with fewer steps and being model-agnostic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the slow sampling problem in diffusion models by creating smaller or fewer-step models that approximate high-step teachers, avoiding fixed reconstruction/consistency losses.

Method: A reinforcement learning-driven distillation framework where the student model is trained using a reward signal aligned with the teacher's outputs, allowing dynamic exploration of multiple denoising paths for optimized steps toward high-probability data regions.

Result: The method achieves superior performance with significantly fewer inference steps and computational resources compared to existing distillation techniques.

Conclusion: The RL-based distillation framework is effective for efficient diffusion learning, model-agnostic, and provides a general optimization paradigm.

Abstract: Distillation addresses the slow sampling problem in diffusion models by creating models with smaller size or fewer steps that approximate the behavior of high-step teachers. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning based distillation framework for diffusion models. Instead of relying on fixed reconstruction or consistency losses, we treat the distillation process as a policy optimization problem, where the student is trained using a reward signal derived from alignment with the teacher's outputs. This RL driven approach dynamically guides the student to explore multiple denoising paths, allowing it to take longer, optimized steps toward high-probability regions of the data distribution, rather than relying on incremental refinements. Our framework utilizes the inherent ability of diffusion models to handle larger steps and effectively manage the generative process. Experimental results show that our method achieves superior performance with significantly fewer inference steps and computational resources compared to existing distillation techniques. Additionally, the framework is model agnostic, applicable to any type of diffusion models with suitable reward functions, providing a general optimization paradigm for efficient diffusion learning.

Motivation: To address the need for effective mixed-precision training by identifying the right combination of training methods, especially for dynamic, property-aware quantization that preserves model quality across strategies and datasets.

Method: A Mixture-of-Representations (MoR) framework that dynamically analyzes a tensor's numerical properties to select between FP8 and BF16 representations at per-tensor and sub-tensor granularities, with concrete algorithms proposed and experimented.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art results with 98.38% of tensors quantized to FP8 format, preserves model quality across various quantization partition strategies and datasets, and demonstrates FP8 accuracies on par with existing approaches without fine-grain partitioning.

Conclusion: Dynamic, property-aware quantization (like MoR) has potential to improve the robustness of low precision training; it can be used alone for good results or combined with other methods to leverage even lower precision formats like NVFP4.

Abstract: Mixed-precision training is a crucial technique for scaling deep learning models, but successful mixedprecision training requires identifying and applying the right combination of training methods. This paper presents our preliminary study on Mixture-of-Representations (MoR), a novel, per-tensor and sub-tensor level quantization framework that dynamically analyzes a tensor's numerical properties to select between a variety of different representations. Based on the framework, we have proposed and experimented concrete algorithms that choose dynamically between FP8 and BF16 representations for both per-tensor and sub-tensor level granularities. Our universal approach is designed to preserve model quality across various quantization partition strategies and datasets. Our initial findings show that this approach can achieve state-of-the-art results with 98.38% of tensors quantized to the FP8 format. This work highlights the potential of dynamic, property-aware quantization while preserving model quality. We believe this approach can generally improve the robustness of low precision training, as demonstrated by achieving FP8 accuracies that are on par with existing approaches without the need for fine-grain partitioning, or can be used in combination with other training methods to improve the leverage of even lower precision number formats such as NVFP4.

### [137] [Long-Range Distillation: Distilling 10,000 Years of Simulated Climate into Long Timestep AI Weather Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22814)
*Scott A. Martin,Noah Brenowitz,Dale Durran,Michael Pritchard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces long-range distillation, a method to train long-timestep probabilistic AI models for accurate long-range weather forecasting using synthetic data from an autoregressive teacher model, showing improved skill over climatology and comparable S2S skill to ECMWF after fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in long-range weather forecasting: error accumulation in autoregressive models, limited reanalysis data leading to overfitting in long-timestep models, and instability/calibration issues in autoregressive models for S2S/seasonal leads.

Method: Long-range distillation: train a long-timestep probabilistic student model using synthetic data (10,000+ years from DLESyM teacher model) to forecast directly at long ranges, with optional ERA5 fine-tuning for real-world performance.

Result: In perfect-model experiments, distilled models outperform climatology and approach teacher skill with single-step forecasts; real-world models achieve S2S skill comparable to ECMWF ensemble after ERA5 fine-tuning; skill scales with synthetic data size.

Conclusion: Long-range distillation using AI-generated synthetic data enables scalable, accurate long-range weather forecasting, overcoming data limitations of reanalysis datasets and autoregressive model drawbacks.

Abstract: Accurate long-range weather forecasting remains a major challenge for AI models, both because errors accumulate over autoregressive rollouts and because reanalysis datasets used for training offer a limited sample of the slow modes of climate variability underpinning predictability. Most AI weather models are autoregressive, producing short lead forecasts that must be repeatedly applied to reach subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) or seasonal lead times, often resulting in instability and calibration issues. Long-timestep probabilistic models that generate long-range forecasts in a single step offer an attractive alternative, but training on the 40-year reanalysis record leads to overfitting, suggesting orders of magnitude more training data are required. We introduce long-range distillation, a method that trains a long-timestep probabilistic "student" model to forecast directly at long-range using a huge synthetic training dataset generated by a short-timestep autoregressive "teacher" model. Using the Deep Learning Earth System Model (DLESyM) as the teacher, we generate over 10,000 years of simulated climate to train distilled student models for forecasting across a range of timescales. In perfect-model experiments, the distilled models outperform climatology and approach the skill of their autoregressive teacher while replacing hundreds of autoregressive steps with a single timestep. In the real world, they achieve S2S forecast skill comparable to the ECMWF ensemble forecast after ERA5 fine-tuning. The skill of our distilled models scales with increasing synthetic training data, even when that data is orders of magnitude larger than ERA5. This represents the first demonstration that AI-generated synthetic training data can be used to scale long-range forecast skill.

*Gaurav Chaudhary,Laxmidhar Behera*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Student-Teacher learning paradigm with a Temporal Variance-Driven Curriculum to address sample inefficiency in multi-goal RL, showing consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods across 11 tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniform goal selection leads to sample inefficiency in multi-goal RL where agents need to learn a universal goal-conditioned policy.

Method: A Student-Teacher learning paradigm with a Temporal Variance-Driven Curriculum: the teacher module dynamically prioritizes goals with the highest temporal variance in the policy's confidence score (parameterized by Q-values) to provide adaptive learning signals.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates consistent and notable improvements over state-of-the-art curriculum learning and goal-selection methods across 11 diverse robotic manipulation and maze navigation tasks.

Conclusion: The Temporal Variance-Driven Curriculum in the Student-Teacher framework effectively accelerates Goal-Conditioned RL by addressing sample inefficiency, with a theoretical connection between Q-value temporal variance and policy evolution established.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved significant success in solving single-goal tasks. However, uniform goal selection often results in sample inefficiency in multi-goal settings where agents must learn a universal goal-conditioned policy. Inspired by the adaptive and structured learning processes observed in biological systems, we propose a novel Student-Teacher learning paradigm with a Temporal Variance-Driven Curriculum to accelerate Goal-Conditioned RL. In this framework, the teacher module dynamically prioritizes goals with the highest temporal variance in the policy's confidence score, parameterized by the state-action value (Q) function. The teacher provides an adaptive and focused learning signal by targeting these high-uncertainty goals, fostering continual and efficient progress. We establish a theoretical connection between the temporal variance of Q-values and the evolution of the policy, providing insights into the method's underlying principles. Our approach is algorithm-agnostic and integrates seamlessly with existing RL frameworks. We demonstrate this through evaluation across 11 diverse robotic manipulation and maze navigation tasks. The results show consistent and notable improvements over state-of-the-art curriculum learning and goal-selection methods.

### [139] [Fundamental Novel Consistency Theory: $H$-Consistency Bounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22880)
*Yutao Zhong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies target loss estimation error relative to surrogate loss, deriving H-consistency bounds (stronger than Bayes-consistency/H-calibration and more informative than excess error bounds) across binary/multi-class classification, various surrogates (convex, max/sum/constrained, comp-sum like cross-entropy), adversarial scenarios, and provides a framework for bounds derivation plus growth rate/minimizability gap analysis to guide surrogate selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap where training loss functions (surrogates) often differ from target loss (due to computational intractability/lack of differentiability) by analyzing the relationship between target loss estimation error and surrogate loss estimation error, and providing stronger guarantees than existing ones.

Method: The paper first establishes tight distribution-dependent/independent H-consistency bounds for binary classification (convex surrogates, adversarial settings for ρ-margin/sigmoid loss). Then extends to multi-class classification: first H-consistency bounds for max/sum/constrained losses (non-adversarial/adversarial), proves some cases have no non-trivial bounds, derives bounds for comp-sum losses and introduces smooth adversarial variants. It also develops a comprehensive framework for deriving bounds across surrogates, new characterizations for constrained/comp-sum losses, and analyzes growth rates (universal square-root for smooth surrogates) and minimizability gaps.

Result: The paper derives H-consistency bounds for various surrogates in binary/multi-class classification (including adversarial scenarios), finds some cases have no non-trivial bounds, establishes a universal square-root growth rate for smooth surrogates in binary/multi-class tasks, and provides minimizability gap analysis to guide surrogate selection.

Conclusion: The paper's H-consistency bounds offer stronger guarantees than existing alternatives, cover a wide range of surrogates and scenarios, and the framework/growth rate/minimizability gap analysis provides valuable guidance for selecting appropriate surrogates in machine learning tasks.

Abstract: In machine learning, the loss functions optimized during training often differ from the target loss that defines task performance due to computational intractability or lack of differentiability. We present an in-depth study of the target loss estimation error relative to the surrogate loss estimation error. Our analysis leads to $H$-consistency bounds, which are guarantees accounting for the hypothesis set $H$. These bounds offer stronger guarantees than Bayes-consistency or $H$-calibration and are more informative than excess error bounds.
  We begin with binary classification, establishing tight distribution-dependent and -independent bounds. We provide explicit bounds for convex surrogates (including linear models and neural networks) and analyze the adversarial setting for surrogates like $ρ$-margin and sigmoid loss. Extending to multi-class classification, we present the first $H$-consistency bounds for max, sum, and constrained losses, covering both non-adversarial and adversarial scenarios. We demonstrate that in some cases, non-trivial $H$-consistency bounds are unattainable. We also investigate comp-sum losses (e.g., cross-entropy, MAE), deriving their first $H$-consistency bounds and introducing smooth adversarial variants that yield robust learning algorithms.
  We develop a comprehensive framework for deriving these bounds across various surrogates, introducing new characterizations for constrained and comp-sum losses. Finally, we examine the growth rates of $H$-consistency bounds, establishing a universal square-root growth rate for smooth surrogates in binary and multi-class tasks, and analyze minimizability gaps to guide surrogate selection.

TL;DR: This thesis comprehensively studies learning with multiple-expert deferral and related abstention, providing new surrogate losses with strong consistency guarantees and effective algorithms for classification and regression scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face hallucinations and high inference costs; leveraging multiple experts (defer uncertain inputs to capable ones, route simple queries to smaller models) motivates learning with multiple-expert deferral and abstention.

Method: 1. For learning with abstention (multi-class classification): analyze score-based/predictor-rejector formulations, introduce new surrogate losses, prove non-asymptotic consistency guarantees, test on CIFAR-10/100/SVHN. 2. For general multi-expert deferral (classification): design new surrogate losses for single/two-stage scenarios, prove H-consistency bounds, show realizable H-consistency for constant costs.3. For regression with deferral: introduce versatile framework (multiple experts, various costs, single/two-stage methods), subsume recent abstention work, propose H-consistent surrogate losses and test algorithms.

Result: The proposed algorithms (from new surrogate losses) demonstrate superior performance in classification (CIFAR/SVHN) and regression scenarios; the consistency guarantees validate their theoretical soundness.

Conclusion: Learning with multiple-expert deferral and abstention is a viable solution to LLMs' hallucination and cost issues; the thesis provides a comprehensive theoretical foundation (consistency guarantees) and practical algorithms for classification and regression tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance but face critical challenges: hallucinations and high inference costs. Leveraging multiple experts offers a solution: deferring uncertain inputs to more capable experts improves reliability, while routing simpler queries to smaller, distilled models enhances efficiency. This motivates the problem of learning with multiple-expert deferral. This thesis presents a comprehensive study of this problem and the related problem of learning with abstention, supported by strong consistency guarantees.
  First, for learning with abstention (a special case of deferral), we analyze score-based and predictor-rejector formulations in multi-class classification. We introduce new families of surrogate losses and prove strong non-asymptotic, hypothesis set-specific consistency guarantees, resolving two existing open questions. We analyze both single-stage and practical two-stage settings, with experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN demonstrating the superior performance of our algorithms.
  Second, we address general multi-expert deferral in classification. We design new surrogate losses for both single-stage and two-stage scenarios and prove they benefit from strong $H$-consistency bounds. For the two-stage scenario, we show that our surrogate losses are realizable $H$-consistent for constant cost functions, leading to effective new algorithms.
  Finally, we introduce a novel framework for regression with deferral to address continuous label spaces. Our versatile framework accommodates multiple experts and various cost structures, supporting both single-stage and two-stage methods. It subsumes recent work on regression with abstention. We propose new surrogate losses with proven $H$-consistency and demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of the resulting algorithms.

*S. Dai,G. Sun,F. Li,X. Tang,Q. Wang,Y. Cong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Federated Multi-Task Clustering (FMTC), a framework for personalized clustering in decentralized environments that avoids unreliable pseudo-labels and captures shared client structure via tensor-based correlation, outperforming baselines in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spectral clustering models are unsuitable for decentralized settings, while federated learning approaches for clustering rely on unreliable pseudo-labels and fail to capture latent correlations among heterogeneous clients.

Method: FMTC has two components: client-side personalized clustering module (parameterized mapping for out-of-sample inference without pseudo-labels) and server-side tensorial correlation module (unified tensor of client models with low-rank regularization to find common subspace). The joint optimization uses a privacy-preserving ADMM-based distributed algorithm (parallel local updates + server aggregation).

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets show FMTC significantly outperforms various baseline and state-of-the-art federated clustering algorithms.

Conclusion: FMTC effectively addresses the limitations of existing federated clustering methods by enabling personalized models and capturing shared client structure, achieving superior performance in decentralized environments.

Abstract: Spectral clustering has emerged as one of the most effective clustering algorithms due to its superior performance. However, most existing models are designed for centralized settings, rendering them inapplicable in modern decentralized environments. Moreover, current federated learning approaches often suffer from poor generalization performance due to reliance on unreliable pseudo-labels, and fail to capture the latent correlations amongst heterogeneous clients. To tackle these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework named Federated Multi-Task Clustering (i.e.,FMTC), which intends to learn personalized clustering models for heterogeneous clients while collaboratively leveraging their shared underlying structure in a privacy-preserving manner. More specifically, the FMTC framework is composed of two main components: client-side personalized clustering module, which learns a parameterized mapping model to support robust out-of-sample inference, bypassing the need for unreliable pseudo-labels; and server-side tensorial correlation module, which explicitly captures the shared knowledge across all clients. This is achieved by organizing all client models into a unified tensor and applying a low-rank regularization to discover their common subspace. To solve this joint optimization problem, we derive an efficient, privacy-preserving distributed algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, which decomposes the global problem into parallel local updates on clients and an aggregation step on the server. To the end, several extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed FMTC framework significantly outperforms various baseline and state-of-the-art federated clustering algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning models for cognitive diagnosis are limited by long-tailed distribution and dynamic changes in data.

Method: A meta-learning framework (MetaCD) combining meta-learning for optimal initialization (alleviating long-tailed problem) and a parameter protection mechanism (adapting to dynamic changes).

Result: Comprehensive experiments on five real-world datasets show MetaCD outperforms other baselines in accuracy and generalization.

Conclusion: MetaCD improves model plasticity on single tasks and ensures stability/generalization on sequential tasks, effectively addressing key challenges in cognitive diagnosis.

Abstract: Cognitive diagnosis is an essential research topic in intelligent education, aimed at assessing the level of mastery of different skills by students. So far, many research works have used deep learning models to explore the complex interactions between students, questions, and skills. However, the performance of existing method is frequently limited by the long-tailed distribution and dynamic changes in the data. To address these challenges, we propose a meta-learning framework for cognitive diagnosis based on continual learning (MetaCD). This framework can alleviate the long-tailed problem by utilizing meta-learning to learn the optimal initialization state, enabling the model to achieve good accuracy on new tasks with only a small amount of data. In addition, we utilize a continual learning method named parameter protection mechanism to give MetaCD the ability to adapt to new skills or new tasks, in order to adapt to dynamic changes in data. MetaCD can not only improve the plasticity of our model on a single task, but also ensure the stability and generalization of the model on sequential tasks. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world datasets show that MetaCD outperforms other baselines in both accuracy and generalization.

*Ünver Çiftçi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sat-EnQ, a two-phase RL framework inspired by bounded rationality and developmental learning, addresses Deep Q-learning instability by first using satisficing with dynamic baseline to train diverse low-variance Q-networks then distilling into a larger network for fine-tuning; it reduces variance by 3.8x, eliminates catastrophic failures, resists noise, and cuts compute by 2.5x vs bootstrapped ensembles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep Q-learning algorithms are unstable, especially early in training when the maximization operator amplifies estimation errors; need a method to mitigate this instability and overestimation while maintaining performance.

Method: Sat-EnQ uses a two-phase framework: Phase1 trains an ensemble of lightweight Q-networks under a satisficing objective with dynamic baseline to limit early value growth; Phase2 distills the ensemble into a larger network and fine-tunes with Double DQN.

Result: Sat-EnQ achieves 3.8x variance reduction, eliminates catastrophic failures (0% vs DQN's50%), maintains79% performance under environmental noise, and requires2.5x less compute than bootstrapped ensembles.

Conclusion: Embracing satisficing before optimization provides a principled path toward robust reinforcement learning, as shown by Sat-EnQ's superior stability, performance, and efficiency.

Abstract: Deep Q-learning algorithms remain notoriously unstable, especially during early training when the maximization operator amplifies estimation errors. Inspired by bounded rationality theory and developmental learning, we introduce Sat-EnQ, a two-phase framework that first learns to be ``good enough'' before optimizing aggressively. In Phase 1, we train an ensemble of lightweight Q-networks under a satisficing objective that limits early value growth using a dynamic baseline, producing diverse, low-variance estimates while avoiding catastrophic overestimation. In Phase 2, the ensemble is distilled into a larger network and fine-tuned with standard Double DQN. We prove theoretically that satisficing induces bounded updates and cannot increase target variance, with a corollary quantifying conditions for substantial reduction. Empirically, Sat-EnQ achieves 3.8x variance reduction, eliminates catastrophic failures (0% vs 50% for DQN), maintains 79% performance under environmental noise}, and requires 2.5x less compute than bootstrapped ensembles. Our results highlight a principled path toward robust reinforcement learning by embracing satisficing before optimization.

TL;DR: This paper proposes Multiple Token Divergence (MTD) to measure language models' in-context computational effort, which avoids invasiveness and instability of prior methods, and introduces Divergence Steering for controlling computational character; MTD outperforms prior methods in distinguishing task complexity and correlates with reasoning accuracy and problem difficulty.

Motivation: To address the key challenge of measuring language models' in-context computational effort, as existing metrics like next-token loss fail to capture reasoning complexity, and prior latent state compressibility methods are invasive and unstable.

Result: MTD is more effective than prior methods at distinguishing complex tasks from simple ones; on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, MTD correlates positively with problem difficulty and lower MTD is associated with more accurate reasoning.

Conclusion: MTD provides a practical, lightweight tool for analyzing and steering the computational dynamics of language models.

Abstract: Measuring the in-context computational effort of language models is a key challenge, as metrics like next-token loss fail to capture reasoning complexity. Prior methods based on latent state compressibility can be invasive and unstable. We propose Multiple Token Divergence (MTD), a simple measure of computational effort defined as the KL divergence between a model's full output distribution and that of a shallow, auxiliary prediction head.

Building on this, we introduce Divergence Steering, a novel decoding method to control the computational character of generated text. We empirically show that MTD is more effective than prior methods at distinguishing complex tasks from simple ones. On mathematical reasoning benchmarks, MTD correlates positively with problem difficulty. Lower MTD is associated with more accurate reasoning.

### [145] [APO: Alpha-Divergence Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22953)
*Wang Zixian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Alpha-Divergence Preference Optimization (APO), an anchored framework using Csiszar alpha-divergence to interpolate between forward and reverse KL behaviors, achieving competitive performance with baselines while maintaining stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing alignment methods: forward KL-based methods (like supervised fine-tuning) are stable but under-exploit high-reward modes, while reverse KL-based methods (like PPO) enable mode-seeking but risk mode collapse; anchored methods commit to a single divergence.

Method: APO uses Csiszar alpha-divergence to continuously interpolate between forward and reverse KL within anchored geometry, with a unified gradient dynamics parameterized by alpha and a reward-and-confidence-guarded alpha schedule transitioning from coverage to exploitation when policy is improving and calibrated.

Result: Experiments on Qwen3-1.7B with math-level3 show APO achieves competitive performance with GRPO and GSPO baselines while maintaining training stability.

Conclusion: APO's anchored framework with alpha-divergence interpolation effectively balances stability and mode-seeking in alignment, offering a promising approach for policy optimization.

Abstract: Two divergence regimes dominate modern alignment practice. Supervised fine-tuning and many distillation-style objectives implicitly minimize the forward KL divergence KL(q || pi_theta), yielding stable mode-covering updates but often under-exploiting high-reward modes. In contrast, PPO-style online reinforcement learning from human feedback behaves closer to reverse KL divergence KL(pi_theta || q), enabling mode-seeking improvements but risking mode collapse. Recent anchored methods, such as ADPO, show that performing the projection in anchored coordinates can substantially improve stability, yet they typically commit to a single divergence. We introduce Alpha-Divergence Preference Optimization (APO), an anchored framework that uses Csiszar alpha-divergence to continuously interpolate between forward and reverse KL behavior within the same anchored geometry. We derive unified gradient dynamics parameterized by alpha, analyze gradient variance properties, and propose a practical reward-and-confidence-guarded alpha schedule that transitions from coverage to exploitation only when the policy is both improving and confidently calibrated. Experiments on Qwen3-1.7B with math-level3 demonstrate that APO achieves competitive performance with GRPO and GSPO baselines while maintaining training stability.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Access to longitudinal, individual-level data on work-life balance and wellbeing is limited by privacy, ethical, and logistical constraints. This poses challenges for reproducible research, methodological benchmarking, and education in domains such as stress modeling, behavioral analysis, and machine learning.
  We introduce FLOW, a synthetic longitudinal dataset designed to model daily interactions between workload, lifestyle behaviors, and wellbeing. FLOW is generated using a rule-based, feedback-driven simulation that produces coherent temporal dynamics across variables such as stress, sleep, mood, physical activity, and body weight. The dataset simulates 1{,}000 individuals over a two-year period with daily resolution and is released as a publicly available resource.
  In addition to the static dataset, we describe a configurable data generation tool that enables reproducible experimentation under adjustable behavioral and contextual assumptions. FLOW is intended as a controlled experimental environment rather than a proxy for observed human populations, supporting exploratory analysis, methodological development, and benchmarking where real-world data are inaccessible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic sleep staging is critical for healthcare due to global sleep disorder prevalence; existing single-channel EEG approaches face issues of class imbalance, limited receptive-field modeling, and insufficient interpretability, with a need to improve N1 stage detection.

Method: The framework combines compact multi-scale feature extraction with temporal modeling to capture local and long-range dependencies; uses class-weighted loss functions and data augmentation to handle imbalance; segments EEG into sub-epoch chunks and averages softmax probabilities across chunks for final predictions.

Result: Overall accuracy of 89.72% and macro-average F1-score of 85.46% on SleepEDF datasets; F1-score of 61.7% for N1 stage, showing substantial improvement over previous methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively improves sleep staging performance while maintaining interpretability and suitability for real-world clinical applications.

Abstract: Automatic sleep staging is a critical task in healthcare due to the global prevalence of sleep disorders. This study focuses on single-channel electroencephalography (EEG), a practical and widely available signal for automatic sleep staging. Existing approaches face challenges such as class imbalance, limited receptive-field modeling, and insufficient interpretability. This work proposes a context-aware and interpretable framework for single-channel EEG sleep staging, with particular emphasis on improving detection of the N1 stage. Many prior models operate as black boxes with stacked layers, lacking clearly defined and interpretable feature extraction roles.The proposed model combines compact multi-scale feature extraction with temporal modeling to capture both local and long-range dependencies. To address data imbalance, especially in the N1 stage, classweighted loss functions and data augmentation are applied. EEG signals are segmented into sub-epoch chunks, and final predictions are obtained by averaging softmax probabilities across chunks, enhancing contextual representation and robustness.The proposed framework achieves an overall accuracy of 89.72% and a macro-average F1-score of 85.46%. Notably, it attains an F1- score of 61.7% for the challenging N1 stage, demonstrating a substantial improvement over previous methods on the SleepEDF datasets. These results indicate that the proposed approach effectively improves sleep staging performance while maintaining interpretability and suitability for real-world clinical applications.

TL;DR: A large-scale empirical study challenges the assumption that complex multimodal learning architectures outperform simple ones, showing a Simple Baseline (SimBaMM) is comparable to 19 high-impact methods under standardized conditions; it advocates for methodological rigor over architectural novelty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the assumption that multimodal-specific, complex architectures improve performance in multimodal learning, addressing potential methodological shortcomings in existing literature.

Method: Reimplement 19 high-impact multimodal methods under standardized conditions, evaluate across 9 diverse datasets (up to 23 modalities), test generalizability (including missing modalities); propose SimBaMM (a late-fusion Transformer baseline); conduct rigorous hyperparameter tuning and statistical analysis; include a case study of a recent method and a reliability checklist.

Result: Complex architectures do not reliably outperform SimBaMM; they perform comparably to SimBaMM and often fail to outperform well-tuned unimodal baselines, especially in small-data regimes.

Conclusion: A shift in focus is needed from architectural novelty to methodological rigor in multimodal learning evaluations.

Abstract: Deep learning architectures for multimodal learning have increased in complexity, driven by the assumption that multimodal-specific methods improve performance. We challenge this assumption through a large-scale empirical study reimplementing 19 high-impact methods under standardized conditions, evaluating them across nine diverse datasets with up to 23 modalities, and testing their generalizability to new tasks beyond their original scope, including settings with missing modalities. We propose a Simple Baseline for Multimodal Learning (SimBaMM), a straightforward late-fusion Transformer architecture, and demonstrate that under standardized experimental conditions with rigorous hyperparameter tuning of all methods, more complex architectures do not reliably outperform SimBaMM. Statistical analysis indicates that more complex methods perform comparably to SimBaMM and frequently do not reliably outperform well-tuned unimodal baselines, especially in the small-data regime considered in many original studies. To support our findings, we include a case study of a recent multimodal learning method highlighting the methodological shortcomings in the literature. In addition, we provide a pragmatic reliability checklist to promote comparable, robust, and trustworthy future evaluations. In summary, we argue for a shift in focus: away from the pursuit of architectural novelty and toward methodological rigor.

*Fuli Qiao,Mehrdad Mahdavi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a parameter-efficient continual learning method for LLMs using orthogonal initialization and sequential merging of LoRAs to address catastrophic forgetting, memory growth, and task interference issues, with theoretical and experimental validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LoRA-based continual learning methods face problems like increasing computational memory with tasks, limited storage space, and task interference due to lack of effective LoRA merging mechanisms.

Method: The method orthogonally initializes new LoRAs using basis from previous ones and sequentially merges them into a unified LoRA with a time-aware scaling mechanism to balance new and old knowledge, leveraging LoRA's intrinsic asymmetry.

Result: The approach maintains constant memory complexity, minimizes task interference via orthogonal initialization, improves performance via adaptive scaling, and is validated through extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks with various Llama models.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting while being efficient in memory and performance, as shown by theoretical analysis and experimental results.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient continual learning has emerged as a promising approach for large language models (LLMs) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting while enabling adaptation to new tasks. Current Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) continual learning techniques often retain and freeze previously learned LoRAs or generate data representations to overcome forgetting, typically utilizing these to support new LoRAs learn new tasks. However, these methods not only ignore growing computational memory with tasks and limited storage space but also suffer from potential task interference due to the lack of effective LoRA merging mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a novel continual learning method that orthogonally initializes and sequentially merges LoRAs updates into a single unified LoRA. Our method leverages orthogonal basis extraction from previously learned LoRA to initialize the learning of new tasks, further exploits the intrinsic asymmetry property of LoRA components by using a time-aware scaling mechanism to balance new and old knowledge during continual merging. Our approach maintains constant memory complexity with respect to the number of tasks, minimizes interference between past and new tasks via orthogonal basis initialization, and improves performance over asymmetric LoRA merging via adaptive scaling. We provide theoretical analysis to justify our design and conduct extensive experiments across diverse continual learning benchmarks using various Llama models, demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

*Muhammad Haseeb,Salaar Masood,Muhammad Abdullah Sohail*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper uses Mechanistic Interpretability to study why FedAvg fails under Non-IID data, finding conflicting client updates cause circuit collapse, reframing statistical drift as mechanistic preservation failure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover the internal mechanistic causes behind FedAvg's performance degradation under Non-IID data conditions, which were previously a black box.

Method: Train inherently interpretable, weight-sparse neural networks in an FL framework, track functional sparse sub-networks (circuits) across clients and rounds, and use IoU to quantify circuit preservation.

Result: Non-IID data leads to structurally distinct local circuits that diverge, causing their degradation in the global model—providing first mechanistic evidence of circuit collapse from conflicting updates.

Conclusion: The problem of statistical drift in FL can be reframed as a concrete failure of mechanistic preservation, enabling more targeted solutions.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training of models on decentralized data, but its performance degrades significantly under Non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) data conditions. While this accuracy loss is well-documented, the internal mechanistic causes remain a black box. This paper investigates the canonical FedAvg algorithm through the lens of Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) to diagnose this failure mode. We hypothesize that the aggregation of conflicting client updates leads to circuit collapse, the destructive interference of functional, sparse sub-networks responsible for specific class predictions. By training inherently interpretable, weight-sparse neural networks within an FL framework, we identify and track these circuits across clients and communication rounds. Using Intersection-over-Union (IoU) to quantify circuit preservation, we provide the first mechanistic evidence that Non-IID data distributions cause structurally distinct local circuits to diverge, leading to their degradation in the global model. Our findings reframe the problem of statistical drift in FL as a concrete, observable failure of mechanistic preservation, paving the way for more targeted solutions.

*Min Zhu,Jingmin Sun,Zecheng Zhang,Hayden Schaeffer,Lu Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a physics-informed multimodal foundation model (PI-MFM) that enforces governing equations during pretraining and adaptation to address data-hunger and lack of physics in existing multi-operator PDE learning approaches, showing superior performance on 13 PDE families especially in sparse data scenarios and enabling zero-shot fine-tuning to unseen PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-operator PDE learning approaches are data-hungry and neglect physics during training, limiting their performance in sparse data scenarios and transferability to unseen PDEs.

Method: PI-MFM takes symbolic PDE representations as input, automatically assembles PDE residual losses via vectorized derivative computation, and uses unified physics-informed objectives across equation families for pretraining and adaptation.

Result: On 13 parametric 1D time-dependent PDE families, PI-MFM outperforms purely data-driven models, especially with sparse labeled points, partial time domains, or few function pairs; physics losses improve noise robustness, and resampling collocation points boosts accuracy; zero-shot fine-tuning to unseen PDEs reduces test errors to ~1% without labeled solution data.

Conclusion: PI-MFM provides a practical and scalable path toward data-efficient, transferable PDE solvers.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) govern a wide range of physical systems, and recent multimodal foundation models have shown promise for learning PDE solution operators across diverse equation families. However, existing multi-operator learning approaches are data-hungry and neglect physics during training. Here, we propose a physics-informed multimodal foundation model (PI-MFM) framework that directly enforces governing equations during pretraining and adaptation. PI-MFM takes symbolic representations of PDEs as the input, and automatically assembles PDE residual losses from the input expression via a vectorized derivative computation. These designs enable any PDE-encoding multimodal foundation model to be trained or adapted with unified physics-informed objectives across equation families. On a benchmark of 13 parametric one-dimensional time-dependent PDE families, PI-MFM consistently outperforms purely data-driven counterparts, especially with sparse labeled spatiotemporal points, partially observed time domains, or few labeled function pairs. Physics losses further improve robustness against noise, and simple strategies such as resampling collocation points substantially improve accuracy. We also analyze the accuracy, precision, and computational cost of automatic differentiation and finite differences for derivative computation within PI-MFM. Finally, we demonstrate zero-shot physics-informed fine-tuning to unseen PDE families: starting from a physics-informed pretrained model, adapting using only PDE residuals and initial/boundary conditions, without any labeled solution data, rapidly reduces test errors to around 1% and clearly outperforms physics-only training from scratch. These results show that PI-MFM provides a practical and scalable path toward data-efficient, transferable PDE solvers.

*Boyang Zhang,Xiaobing Chen,Songyang Zhang,Shuai Zhang,Xiangwei Zhou,Mingxuan Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes FLEX-MoE, a federated Mixture-of-Experts framework addressing edge device resource constraints and non-IID data-induced expert load imbalance by optimizing client-expert assignment and load balancing, with experiments showing superior performance across resource-constrained scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle two critical challenges in deploying Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models with federated learning (FL): resource-constrained edge devices cannot store full expert sets, and non-IID data distributions cause severe expert load imbalance that degrades model performance.

Method: Introduce client-expert fitness scores quantifying expert suitability for local datasets via training feedback, and employ an optimization-based algorithm to maximize client-expert specialization while enforcing balanced expert utilization system-wide.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on three different datasets demonstrate the superior performance of FLEX-MoE, together with its ability to maintain balanced expert utilization across diverse resource-constrained scenarios.

Conclusion: FLEX-MoE effectively addresses the challenges of resource constraints and expert load imbalance in federated MoE deployment, outperforming existing greedy methods that ignore load imbalance.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable scalable neural networks through conditional computation. However, their deployment with federated learning (FL) faces two critical challenges: 1) resource-constrained edge devices cannot store full expert sets, and 2) non-IID data distributions cause severe expert load imbalance that degrades model performance. To this end, we propose \textbf{FLEX-MoE}, a novel federated MoE framework that jointly optimizes expert assignment and load balancing under limited client capacity. Specifically, our approach introduces client-expert fitness scores that quantify the expert suitability for local datasets through training feedback, and employs an optimization-based algorithm to maximize client-expert specialization while enforcing balanced expert utilization system-wide. Unlike existing greedy methods that focus solely on personalization while ignoring load imbalance, our FLEX-MoE is capable of addressing the expert utilization skew, which is particularly severe in FL settings with heterogeneous data. Our comprehensive experiments on three different datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed FLEX-MoE, together with its ability to maintain balanced expert utilization across diverse resource-constrained scenarios.

### [153] [Rethinking Fine-Tuning: Unlocking Hidden Capabilities in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23073)
*Mingyuan Zhang,Yue Bai,Yifan Wang,Yiyang Huang,Yun Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper applies Mask Fine-Tuning (MFT) to Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by assigning learnable gating scores to weights instead of explicit updates, outperforming LoRA variants and full fine-tuning while keeping backbones frozen.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most VLM fine-tuning approaches rely on explicit weight updates and underutilize existing representational structures in pre-trained models; MFT has shown promise in language models but not yet applied to VLMs.

Method: Apply MFT to the language and projector components of VLMs with different language backbones, assigning learnable gating scores to each weight to reorganize internal subnetworks for downstream adaptation without altering frozen backbones.

Result: MFT consistently surpasses LoRA variants and even full fine-tuning in performance across VLMs with different language backbones.

Conclusion: Effective VLM adaptation can be achieved not only via weight updates but also by reestablishing connections among existing knowledge using MFT.

Abstract: Explorations in fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) from Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), have made impressive progress. However, most approaches rely on explicit weight updates, overlooking the extensive representational structures already encoded in pre-trained models that remain underutilized. Recent works have demonstrated that Mask Fine-Tuning (MFT) can be a powerful and efficient post-training paradigm for language models. Instead of updating weights, MFT assigns learnable gating scores to each weight, allowing the model to reorganize its internal subnetworks for downstream task adaptation. In this paper, we rethink fine-tuning for VLMs from a structural reparameterization perspective grounded in MFT. We apply MFT to the language and projector components of VLMs with different language backbones and compare against strong PEFT baselines. Experiments show that MFT consistently surpasses LoRA variants and even full fine-tuning, achieving high performance without altering the frozen backbone. Our findings reveal that effective adaptation can emerge not only from updating weights but also from reestablishing connections among the model's existing knowledge.

### [154] [Trust Region Masking for Long-Horizon LLM Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23075)
*Yingru Li,Jiacai Liu,Jiawei Xu,Yuxuan Tong,Ziniu Li,Baoxiang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the off-policy mismatch problem in large language model policy gradient methods, derives tighter error bounds for long-horizon tasks, and proposes Trust Region Masking (TRM) to ensure non-vacuous monotonic improvement guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the issue that classical trust region bounds for off-policy mismatch in LLM-RL scale as O(T²) with sequence length T, making them vacuous for long-horizon tasks.

Method: Derive two tighter bounds (Pinsker-Marginal O(T³/²) and Mixed O(T)) dependent on token-level KL divergence, then propose Trust Region Masking (TRM) which excludes entire sequences violating the trust region from gradient computation.

Result: TRM provides the first non-vacuous monotonic improvement guarantees for long-horizon LLM-RL.

Conclusion: The proposed TRM effectively addresses the vacuous trust region bounds problem in long-horizon LLM-RL by leveraging sequence-level token KL divergence checks.

Abstract: Policy gradient methods for large language models optimize a surrogate objective computed from samples of a rollout policy $π_{\text{roll}}$. When $π_{\text{roll}} \ne π_θ$, there is approximation error between the surrogate and the true objective. Prior work has shown that this off-policy mismatch is unavoidable in modern LLM-RL due to implementation divergence, mixture-of-experts routing discontinuities, and distributed training staleness. Classical trust region bounds on the resulting error scale as $O(T^2)$ with sequence length $T$, rendering them vacuous for long-horizon tasks. We derive two tighter bounds: a Pinsker-Marginal bound scaling as $O(T^{3/2})$ and a Mixed bound scaling as $O(T)$. Crucially, both bounds depend on $D_{kl}^{tok,max}$ -- the maximum token-level KL divergence across all positions in a sequence. This is inherently a sequence-level quantity: it requires examining the entire trajectory to compute, and therefore cannot be controlled by token-independent methods like PPO clipping. We propose Trust Region Masking (TRM), which excludes entire sequences from gradient computation if any token violates the trust region, providing the first non-vacuous monotonic improvement guarantees for long-horizon LLM-RL.

### [155] [Multimodal Functional Maximum Correlation for Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23076)
*Deyang Zheng,Tianyi Zhang,Wenming Zheng,Shujian Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Multimodal Functional Maximum Correlation (MFMC), a self-supervised learning framework for affective computing that captures higher-order multimodal dependencies to address limitations of pairwise alignment methods, showing state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Affective computing faces challenges from heterogeneous physiological responses and scarce annotations; existing self-supervised learning approaches rely on pairwise alignment which fails to capture higher-order interactions between modalities like brain and autonomic responses.

Method: MFMC uses a Dual Total Correlation objective to maximize higher-order multimodal dependence, with a tight sandwich bound optimized via a functional maximum correlation analysis-based trace surrogate.

Result: MFMC improves subject-dependent accuracy on CEAP-360VR from 78.9% to 86.8% and subject-independent accuracy from 27.5% to33.1% using EDA alone; it is within 0.8 percentage points of the best method on the challenging EEG subject-independent split of MAHNOB-HCI.

Conclusion: MFMC is a robust SSL framework for affective computing that effectively captures higher-order multimodal interactions, outperforming or being competitive with existing methods across benchmarks.

Abstract: Emotional states manifest as coordinated yet heterogeneous physiological responses across central and autonomic systems, posing a fundamental challenge for multimodal representation learning in affective computing. Learning such joint dynamics is further complicated by the scarcity and subjectivity of affective annotations, which motivates the use of self-supervised learning (SSL). However, most existing SSL approaches rely on pairwise alignment objectives, which are insufficient to characterize dependencies among more than two modalities and fail to capture higher-order interactions arising from coordinated brain and autonomic responses.
  To address this limitation, we propose Multimodal Functional Maximum Correlation (MFMC), a principled SSL framework that maximizes higher-order multimodal dependence through a Dual Total Correlation (DTC) objective. By deriving a tight sandwich bound and optimizing it using a functional maximum correlation analysis (FMCA) based trace surrogate, MFMC captures joint multimodal interactions directly, without relying on pairwise contrastive losses.
  Experiments on three public affective computing benchmarks demonstrate that MFMC consistently achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance under both subject-dependent and subject-independent evaluation protocols, highlighting its robustness to inter-subject variability. In particular, MFMC improves subject-dependent accuracy on CEAP-360VR from 78.9% to 86.8%, and subject-independent accuracy from 27.5% to 33.1% using the EDA signal alone. Moreover, MFMC remains within 0.8 percentage points of the best-performing method on the most challenging EEG subject-independent split of MAHNOB-HCI.

### [156] [Taming the Tail: Stable LLM Reinforcement Learning via Dynamic Vocabulary Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23087)
*Yingru Li,Jiawei Xu,Jiacai Liu,Yuxuan Tong,Ziniu Li,Tianle Cai,Ge Zhang,Qian Liu,Baoxiang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the training-inference mismatch in RL for LLMs, proves its asymmetric effect (negligible for high-prob tokens, large for tail low-prob ones), proposes dynamic safe vocabulary pruning to stabilize training, and provides theoretical bounds on optimization bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the training-inference mismatch in reinforcement learning for large language models, which arises from differing probability distributions between high-throughput inference engines and precise training systems, leading to accumulated biased mismatches in tail tokens and unstable gradient estimation.

Method: Propose constraining the RL objective to a dynamically-pruned 'safe' vocabulary that excludes extreme tail low-probability tokens, trading large systematic mismatches for small bounded optimization bias.

Result: The method achieves stable training empirically, and theoretically bounds the optimization bias introduced by vocabulary pruning.

Conclusion: The training-inference mismatch has an asymmetric effect on token probabilities; dynamic safe vocabulary pruning effectively stabilizes RL training for LLMs while maintaining bounded optimization bias.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning for large language models (LLMs) faces a fundamental tension: high-throughput inference engines and numerically-precise training systems produce different probability distributions from the same parameters, creating a training-inference mismatch. We prove this mismatch has an asymmetric effect: the bound on log-probability mismatch scales as $(1-p)$ where $p$ is the token probability. For high-probability tokens, this bound vanishes, contributing negligibly to sequence-level mismatch. For low-probability tokens in the tail, the bound remains large, and moreover, when sampled, these tokens exhibit systematically biased mismatches that accumulate over sequences, destabilizing gradient estimation. Rather than applying post-hoc corrections, we propose constraining the RL objective to a dynamically-pruned ``safe'' vocabulary that excludes the extreme tail. By pruning such tokens, we trade large, systematically biased mismatches for a small, bounded optimization bias. Empirically, our method achieves stable training; theoretically, we bound the optimization bias introduced by vocabulary pruning.

### [157] [How Much Data Is Enough? Uniform Convergence Bounds for Generative & Vision-Language Models under Low-Dimensional Structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23109)
*Paul M. Thompson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the uniform generalization and calibration of generative and vision-language models (VLMs) in scientific/medical applications, providing finite-sample uniform convergence bounds under Lipschitz stability assumptions, with implications for data-limited biomedical modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical issue that modern generative and VLMs may not generalize uniformly across inputs/classes/subpopulations (e.g., rare conditions in biomedicine) even with low overall loss, and to understand when such models can achieve uniformly accurate and calibrated behavior with practical sample sizes.

Method: The study adopts a finite-sample perspective, focusing on induced classifier families from varying prompts/semantic embeddings in restricted spaces. It uses classical uniform convergence tools under the assumption of smooth dependence on low-dimensional semantic representations (supported by spectral structure in embeddings), and derives bounds based on Lipschitz stability with respect to prompt embeddings, considering intrinsic/effective dimension and eigenvalue decay.

Result: The main results are finite-sample uniform convergence bounds for accuracy and calibration functionals of VLM-induced classifiers under Lipschitz stability. These bounds depend on intrinsic/effective dimension (not ambient dimension) and explicitly link eigenvalue decay to data requirements.

Conclusion: The findings have implications for data-limited biomedical modeling: they clarify when current dataset sizes support uniformly reliable predictions and why average calibration metrics may overlook worst-case miscalibration.

Abstract: Modern generative and vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used in scientific and medical decision support, where predicted probabilities must be both accurate and well calibrated. Despite strong empirical results with moderate data, it remains unclear when such predictions generalize uniformly across inputs, classes, or subpopulations, rather than only on average-a critical issue in biomedicine, where rare conditions and specific groups can exhibit large errors even when overall loss is low.
  We study this question from a finite-sample perspective and ask: under what structural assumptions can generative and VLM-based predictors achieve uniformly accurate and calibrated behavior with practical sample sizes? Rather than analyzing arbitrary parameterizations, we focus on induced families of classifiers obtained by varying prompts or semantic embeddings within a restricted representation space. When model outputs depend smoothly on a low-dimensional semantic representation-an assumption supported by spectral structure in text and joint image-text embeddings-classical uniform convergence tools yield meaningful non-asymptotic guarantees.
  Our main results give finite-sample uniform convergence bounds for accuracy and calibration functionals of VLM-induced classifiers under Lipschitz stability with respect to prompt embeddings. The implied sample complexity depends on intrinsic/effective dimension, not ambient embedding dimension, and we further derive spectrum-dependent bounds that make explicit how eigenvalue decay governs data requirements. We conclude with implications for data-limited biomedical modeling, including when current dataset sizes can support uniformly reliable predictions and why average calibration metrics may miss worst-case miscalibration.

TL;DR: This paper proposes SE-MLP, a multi-layer perceptron with channel attention and residual connections, to quickly predict penetration acceleration features, outperforming conventional models and validating its engineering applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for obtaining penetration acceleration feature values involve long simulation cycles and expensive computations, which need to be overcome.

Method: A multi-layer Perceptron architecture called SE-MLP is proposed, integrating channel attention mechanism and residual connections; it takes physical parameters under different working conditions as inputs to output layer-wise acceleration features, establishing a nonlinear mapping between physical parameters and penetration characteristics.

Result: SE-MLP achieves superior prediction accuracy, generalization, and stability compared to conventional MLP, XGBoost, and Transformer models; ablation studies confirm the channel attention module and residual structure contribute significantly to performance gains; numerical simulations and range recovery tests show predicted vs measured acceleration peaks and pulse widths are within acceptable engineering tolerances.

Conclusion: The proposed SE-MLP method is feasible and has engineering applicability, providing a practical basis for rapidly generating prior feature values for penetration fuzes.

Abstract: Accurate identification of the penetration process relies heavily on prior feature values of penetration acceleration. However, these feature values are typically obtained through long simulation cycles and expensive computations. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a multi-layer Perceptron architecture, termed squeeze and excitation multi-layer perceptron (SE-MLP), which integrates a channel attention mechanism with residual connections to enable rapid prediction of acceleration feature values. Using physical parameters under different working conditions as inputs, the model outputs layer-wise acceleration features, thereby establishing a nonlinear mapping between physical parameters and penetration characteristics. Comparative experiments against conventional MLP, XGBoost, and Transformer models demonstrate that SE-MLP achieves superior prediction accuracy, generalization, and stability. Ablation studies further confirm that both the channel attention module and residual structure contribute significantly to performance gains. Numerical simulations and range recovery tests show that the discrepancies between predicted and measured acceleration peaks and pulse widths remain within acceptable engineering tolerances. These results validate the feasibility and engineering applicability of the proposed method and provide a practical basis for rapidly generating prior feature values for penetration fuzes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges of optimizing non-standard evaluation metrics (like Fβ-measure) in imbalanced/asymmetric cost scenarios, introduces H-consistent surrogate losses via reformulating metric optimization as generalized cost-sensitive learning, develops METRO algorithms with finite-sample bounds, and shows experimental effectiveness over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard binary classification losses are unsuitable for imbalanced or asymmetric cost applications; existing threshold-based methods for optimizing metrics like Fβ-measure lack tailoring to restricted hypothesis sets and finite-sample guarantees.

Method: Reformulate metric optimization as a generalized cost-sensitive learning problem to design H-consistent surrogate loss functions, then develop METRO algorithms with theoretical performance guarantees.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed METRO methods are effective compared to prior baselines.

Conclusion: Principled algorithms for optimizing generalized metrics (METRO) with H-consistency and finite-sample generalization bounds are viable and outperform existing approaches.

Abstract: In applications with significant class imbalance or asymmetric costs, metrics such as the $F_β$-measure, AM measure, Jaccard similarity coefficient, and weighted accuracy offer more suitable evaluation criteria than standard binary classification loss. However, optimizing these metrics present significant computational and statistical challenges. Existing approaches often rely on the characterization of the Bayes-optimal classifier, and use threshold-based methods that first estimate class probabilities and then seek an optimal threshold. This leads to algorithms that are not tailored to restricted hypothesis sets and lack finite-sample performance guarantees. In this work, we introduce principled algorithms for optimizing generalized metrics, supported by $H$-consistency and finite-sample generalization bounds. Our approach reformulates metric optimization as a generalized cost-sensitive learning problem, enabling the design of novel surrogate loss functions with provable $H$-consistency guarantees. Leveraging this framework, we develop new algorithms, METRO (Metric Optimization), with strong theoretical performance guarantees. We report the results of experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of our methods compared to prior baselines.

Result: GNN-TF outperforms established ML/DL models in predictive accuracy for future tobacco usage when applied to the NCANDA longitudinal resting-state fMRI dataset.

Conclusion: The end-to-end, time-aware transformer fusion structure of GNN-TF successfully integrates multiple data modalities and temporal dynamics, making it a valuable tool for functional brain imaging studies focused on clinical outcome prediction.

Abstract: Integrating non-Euclidean brain imaging data with Euclidean tabular data, such as clinical and demographic information, poses a substantial challenge for medical imaging analysis, particularly in forecasting future outcomes. While machine learning and deep learning techniques have been applied successfully to cross-sectional classification and prediction tasks, effectively forecasting outcomes in longitudinal imaging studies remains challenging. To address this challenge, we introduce a time-aware graph neural network model with transformer fusion (GNN-TF). This model flexibly integrates both tabular data and dynamic brain connectivity data, leveraging the temporal order of these variables within a coherent framework. By incorporating non-Euclidean and Euclidean sources of information from a longitudinal resting-state fMRI dataset from the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA), the GNN-TF enables a comprehensive analysis that captures critical aspects of longitudinal imaging data. Comparative analyses against a variety of established machine learning and deep learning models demonstrate that GNN-TF outperforms these state-of-the-art methods, delivering superior predictive accuracy for predicting future tobacco usage. The end-to-end, time-aware transformer fusion structure of the proposed GNN-TF model successfully integrates multiple data modalities and leverages temporal dynamics, making it a valuable analytic tool for functional brain imaging studies focused on clinical outcome prediction.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of weak signal learning (WSL) by constructing the first specialized dataset with low SNR dominance and extreme class imbalance, proposing a dual-view PDVFN model that achieves high accuracy and robustness in WSL tasks like astronomical spectroscopy, and establishing a foundation for future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weak signal learning (WSL) is a common challenge in fields like fault diagnosis and medical imaging where critical info is masked by noise; the lack of dedicated datasets has constrained research, and even with abundant strong signals, extracting weak signals is key to improving model performance.

Method: The authors construct a specialized dataset with 13,158 spectral samples (over 55% SNR <50, class ratio up to29:1), then propose a dual-view representation (vector + time-frequency map) and a PDVFN model that extracts local sequential features and global frequency-domain structures in parallel following principles of local enhancement, sequential modeling, noise suppression, multi-scale capture, frequency extraction, and global perception.

Result: Experiments show the proposed method achieves higher accuracy and robustness in handling weak signals, high noise, and extreme class imbalance, especially in low SNR and imbalanced scenarios.

Conclusion: This study provides a dedicated dataset, a baseline model (PDVFN), and establishes a foundation for future weak signal learning research.

Abstract: Weak signal learning (WSL) is a common challenge in many fields like fault diagnosis, medical imaging, and autonomous driving, where critical information is often masked by noise and interference, making feature identification difficult. Even in tasks with abundant strong signals, the key to improving model performance often lies in effectively extracting weak signals. However, the lack of dedicated datasets has long constrained research. To address this, we construct the first specialized dataset for weak signal feature learning, containing 13,158 spectral samples. It features low SNR dominance (over 55% samples with SNR below 50) and extreme class imbalance (class ratio up to 29:1), providing a challenging benchmark for classification and regression in weak signal scenarios. We also propose a dual-view representation (vector + time-frequency map) and a PDVFN model tailored to low SNR, distribution skew, and dual imbalance. PDVFN extracts local sequential features and global frequency-domain structures in parallel, following principles of local enhancement, sequential modeling, noise suppression, multi-scale capture, frequency extraction, and global perception. This multi-source complementarity enhances representation for low-SNR and imbalanced data, offering a novel solution for WSL tasks like astronomical spectroscopy. Experiments show our method achieves higher accuracy and robustness in handling weak signals, high noise, and extreme class imbalance, especially in low SNR and imbalanced scenarios. This study provides a dedicated dataset, a baseline model, and establishes a foundation for future WSL research.

We present an alternating projected gradient descent and minimization algorithm for recovering a low-rank feature matrix in a diffusion-based decentralized and federated fashion. We obtain constructive, provable guarantees that provide a lower bound on the required sample complexity and an upper bound on the iteration complexity of our proposed algorithm. We analyze the time and communication complexity of our algorithm and show that it is fast and communication-efficient. We performed numerical simulations to validate the performance of our algorithm and compared it with benchmark algorithms.

Method: KernelEvolve uses kernel specifications as input, operates across multiple programming abstractions (from Triton/CuTe DSL to low-level hardware-agnostic languages), and employs a graph-based search with selection policy, universal operator, fitness function, termination rule, and retrieval-augmented prompt synthesis to adapt to runtime execution context.

Result: Validated on KernelBench suite (100% pass rate on 250 problems across 3 difficulty levels) and 160 PyTorch ATen operators (100% correctness across 3 hardware platforms); reduces development time from weeks to hours; achieves substantial performance improvements over PyTorch baselines; mitigates programmability barriers for new AI hardware.

Conclusion: KernelEvolve effectively automates kernel optimization for DLRM across heterogeneous hardware, enhancing performance, reducing development effort, and lowering programmability barriers for new AI hardware.

Abstract: Making deep learning recommendation model (DLRM) training and inference fast and efficient is important. However, this presents three key system challenges - model architecture diversity, kernel primitive diversity, and hardware generation and architecture heterogeneity. This paper presents KernelEvolve-an agentic kernel coding framework-to tackle heterogeneity at-scale for DLRM. KernelEvolve is designed to take kernel specifications as input and automate the process of kernel generation and optimization for recommendation model across heterogeneous hardware architectures. KernelEvolve does so by operating at multiple programming abstractions, from Triton and CuTe DSL to low-level hardware agnostic languages, spanning the full hardware-software optimization stack. The kernel optimization process is described as graph-based search with selection policy, universal operator, fitness function, and termination rule, dynamically adapts to runtime execution context through retrieval-augmented prompt synthesis. We designed, implemented, and deployed KernelEvolve to optimize a wide variety of production recommendation models across generations of NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, as well as Meta's AI accelerators. We validate KernelEvolve on the publicly-available KernelBench suite, achieving 100% pass rate on all 250 problems across three difficulty levels, and 160 PyTorch ATen operators across three heterogeneous hardware platforms, demonstrating 100% correctness. KernelEvolve reduces development time from weeks to hours and achieves substantial performance improvements over PyTorch baselines across diverse production use cases and for heterogeneous AI systems at-scale. Beyond performance efficiency improvements, KernelEvolve significantly mitigates the programmability barrier for new AI hardware by enabling automated kernel generation for in-house developed AI hardware.

*Qingyu Yin,Yulun Wu,Zhennan Shen,Sunbowen Li,Zhilin Wang,Yanshu Li,Chak Tou Leong,Jiale Kang,Jinjin Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates over 12 Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods under the Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) paradigm on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, finding structural variants like DoRA, AdaLoRA, MiSS outperform LoRA, spectral collapse in SVD-informed methods, and extreme parameter reduction bottlenecks reasoning, providing a guide for RL PEFT exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The optimal PEFT architecture for RLVR (which enhances language models' reasoning via verifiable feedback) remains unidentified despite common use of methods like LoRA.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation of over 12 PEFT methodologies across DeepSeek-R1-Distill families on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, plus ablation studies and scaling experiments.

Result: 1) Structural variants (DoRA, AdaLoRA, MiSS) consistently outperform LoRA; 2) SVD-informed initialization strategies (PiSSA, MiLoRA) suffer from spectral collapse due to misalignment between principal-component updates and RL optimization; 3) Extreme parameter reduction (VeRA, Rank-1) severely bottlenecks reasoning capacity.

Conclusion: This work provides a definitive guide advocating for more exploration of parameter-efficient RL methods.

Abstract: We systematically evaluate Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods under the paradigm of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). RLVR incentivizes language models to enhance their reasoning capabilities through verifiable feedback; however, while methods like LoRA are commonly used, the optimal PEFT architecture for RLVR remains unidentified. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of over 12 PEFT methodologies across the DeepSeek-R1-Distill families on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Our empirical results challenge the default adoption of standard LoRA with three main findings. First, we demonstrate that structural variants, such as DoRA, AdaLoRA, and MiSS, consistently outperform LoRA. Second, we uncover a spectral collapse phenomenon in SVD-informed initialization strategies (\textit{e.g.,} PiSSA, MiLoRA), attributing their failure to a fundamental misalignment between principal-component updates and RL optimization. Furthermore, our ablations reveal that extreme parameter reduction (\textit{e.g.,} VeRA, Rank-1) severely bottlenecks reasoning capacity. We further conduct ablation studies and scaling experiments to validate our findings. This work provides a definitive guide for advocating for more exploration for parameter-efficient RL methods.

*Abolfazl Younesi,Abbas Shabrang Maryan,Elyas Oustad,Zahra Najafabadi Samani,Mohsen Ansari,Thomas Fahringer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Splitwise, a Lyapunov-assisted DRL framework for adaptive fine-grained partitioning of LLMs across edge and cloud, which outperforms existing methods in latency, energy consumption, and robustness while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of deploying LLMs on edge devices due to limited resources, high latency/cost of cloud-only inference, and static edge-cloud partitions' inability to handle fluctuating bandwidth.

Method: Splitwise uses a Lyapunov-assisted deep reinforcement learning framework to decompose transformer layers into attention heads and feed-forward sub-blocks for fine-grained partitioning; it employs a hierarchical DRL policy to minimize latency, energy, and accuracy degradation while ensuring queue stability, plus partition checkpoints with exponential backoff recovery for robustness.

Result: Experiments show Splitwise reduces end-to-end latency by 1.4x-2.8x, cuts energy consumption by up to 41% vs existing partitioners; lowers 95th-percentile latency by 53-61% relative to cloud-only execution, while maintaining accuracy and modest memory requirements.

Conclusion: Splitwise is an effective adaptive partitioning framework for LLMs across edge-cloud environments, addressing key limitations of static methods and cloud-only inference with superior performance in latency, energy, and robustness.

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) on edge devices is challenging due to their limited memory and power resources. Cloud-only inference reduces device burden but introduces high latency and cost. Static edge-cloud partitions optimize a single metric and struggle when bandwidth fluctuates. We propose Splitwise, a novel Lyapunov-assisted deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for fine-grained, adaptive partitioning of LLMs across edge and cloud environments. Splitwise decomposes transformer layers into attention heads and feed-forward sub-blocks, exposing more partition choices than layer-wise schemes. A hierarchical DRL policy, guided by Lyapunov optimization, jointly minimizes latency, energy consumption, and accuracy degradation while guaranteeing queue stability under stochastic workloads and variable network bandwidth. Splitwise also guarantees robustness via partition checkpoints with exponential backoff recovery in case of communication failures. Experiments on Jetson Orin NX, Galaxy S23, and Raspberry Pi 5 with GPT-2 (1.5B), LLaMA-7B, and LLaMA-13B show that Splitwise reduces end-to-end latency by 1.4x-2.8x and cuts energy consumption by up to 41% compared with existing partitioners. It lowers the 95th-percentile latency by 53-61% relative to cloud-only execution, while maintaining accuracy and modest memory requirements.

### [167] [The Law of Multi-Model Collaboration: Scaling Limits of Model Ensembling for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23340)
*Dakuan Lu,Jiaqi Zhang,Cheng Yuan,Jiawei Shao,Chi Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes the Law of Multi-model Collaboration, showing that multi-model ensembles have better performance scaling than single models, especially heterogeneous ones, providing a theoretical framework for LLM collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The capabilities of single LLMs are bounded, and there's no unifying theoretical framework for performance scaling of multi-model collaboration despite existing integration techniques.

Method: The paper adopts a method-agnostic formulation and assumes an idealized integration oracle where each sample's total cross-entropy loss is the minimum loss from the model pool to quantify the intrinsic upper bound of multi-model collaboration.

Result: Multi-model systems follow power-law scaling with total parameters, showing more significant improvement and lower loss floor than single models; heterogeneous ensembles outperform homogeneous ones, highlighting model diversity as a key driver.

Conclusion: Model collaboration is a critical axis for extending the intelligence frontier of LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have been largely driven by scaling laws for individual models, which predict performance improvements as model parameters and data volume increase. However, the capabilities of any single LLM are inherently bounded. One solution originates from intricate interactions among multiple LLMs, rendering their collective performance surpasses that of any constituent model. Despite the rapid proliferation of multi-model integration techniques such as model routing and post-hoc ensembling, a unifying theoretical framework of performance scaling for multi-model collaboration remains absent. In this work, we propose the Law of Multi-model Collaboration, a scaling law that predicts the performance limits of LLM ensembles based on their aggregated parameter budget. To quantify the intrinsic upper bound of multi-model collaboration, we adopt a method-agnostic formulation and assume an idealized integration oracle where the total cross-entropy loss of each sample is determined by the minimum loss of any model in the model pool. Experimental results reveal that multi-model systems follow a power-law scaling with respect to the total parameter count, exhibiting a more significant improvement trend and a lower theoretical loss floor compared to single model scaling. Moreover, ensembles of heterogeneous model families achieve better performance scaling than those formed within a single model family, indicating that model diversity is a primary driver of collaboration gains. These findings suggest that model collaboration represents a critical axis for extending the intelligence frontier of LLMs.

### [168] [A Simple, Optimal and Efficient Algorithm for Online Exp-Concave Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23190)
*Yi-Han Wang,Peng Zhao,Zhi-Hua Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses computational bottlenecks in Online Newton Step (ONS) for Online eXp-concave Optimization (OXO) and Stochastic eXp-concave Optimization (SXO) by proposing LightONS, a variant that reduces runtime while preserving optimal regret, answering a COLT'13 open problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ONS, the standard algorithm for OXO, has high computational cost due to Mahalanobis projections (Ω(d^ω) per round), leading to total runtime ~O(d^ωT) for OXO and ~O(d^{ω+1}/ε) for SXO (via online-to-batch conversion). A COLT'13 open problem asked for an SXO algorithm with runtime below ~O(d^{ω+1}/ε).

Method: LightONS is a simple ONS variant that uses domain-conversion techniques from parameter-free online learning to introduce a hysteresis mechanism, delaying expensive Mahalanobis projections until necessary.

Result: LightONS preserves ONS's optimal O(d log T) regret for OXO while reducing total runtime to O(d²T + d^ω√(T log T)). For SXO, it gives a method with runtime ~O(d³/ε), solving the COLT'13 open problem.

Conclusion: LightONS is an efficient plug-in replacement for ONS in various scenarios (regret minimization, gradient-norm adaptive regret, parametric stochastic bandits, memory-efficient online learning) due to its lower runtime and preserved optimal performance.

Abstract: Online eXp-concave Optimization (OXO) is a fundamental problem in online learning. The standard algorithm, Online Newton Step (ONS), balances statistical optimality and computational practicality, guaranteeing an optimal regret of $O(d \log T)$, where $d$ is the dimension and $T$ is the time horizon. ONS faces a computational bottleneck due to the Mahalanobis projections at each round. This step costs $Ω(d^ω)$ arithmetic operations for bounded domains, even for the unit ball, where $ω\in (2,3]$ is the matrix-multiplication exponent. As a result, the total runtime can reach $\tilde{O}(d^ωT)$, particularly when iterates frequently oscillate near the domain boundary. For Stochastic eXp-concave Optimization (SXO), computational cost is also a challenge. Deploying ONS with online-to-batch conversion for SXO requires $T = \tilde{O}(d/ε)$ rounds to achieve an excess risk of $ε$, and thereby necessitates an $\tilde{O}(d^{ω+1}/ε)$ runtime. A COLT'13 open problem posed by Koren [2013] asks for an SXO algorithm with runtime less than $\tilde{O}(d^{ω+1}/ε)$.
  This paper proposes a simple variant of ONS, LightONS, which reduces the total runtime to $O(d^2 T + d^ω\sqrt{T \log T})$ while preserving the optimal $O(d \log T)$ regret. LightONS implies an SXO method with runtime $\tilde{O}(d^3/ε)$, thereby answering the open problem. Importantly, LightONS preserves the elegant structure of ONS by leveraging domain-conversion techniques from parameter-free online learning to introduce a hysteresis mechanism that delays expensive Mahalanobis projections until necessary. This design enables LightONS to serve as an efficient plug-in replacement of ONS in broader scenarios, even beyond regret minimization, including gradient-norm adaptive regret, parametric stochastic bandits, and memory-efficient online learning.

*Zhuo Zhang,Xi Yang,Yuan Zhao,Canqun Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes the Physics-Geometry Operator Transformer (PGOT) to address Geometric Aliasing in large-scale unstructured mesh PDE modeling by integrating multi-scale geometric encodings and spatial adaptive computation, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks and industrial tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing efficient architectures for PDE modeling on large-scale unstructured meshes induce Geometric Aliasing, leading to loss of critical physical boundary information.

Method: PGOT uses Spectrum-Preserving Geometric Attention (SpecGeo-Attention) with a 'physics slicing-geometry injection' mechanism to preserve multi-scale geometric features with O(N) complexity, and dynamically routes computations to linear paths for smooth regions and non-linear paths for shocks/discontinuities based on spatial coordinates.

Result: PGOT achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across four standard benchmarks and excels in large-scale industrial tasks like airfoil and car designs.

Conclusion: PGOT effectively addresses Geometric Aliasing and enables spatially adaptive, high-precision PDE modeling on large-scale unstructured meshes, outperforming existing methods in both benchmarks and industrial applications.

Abstract: While Transformers have demonstrated remarkable potential in modeling Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), modeling large-scale unstructured meshes with complex geometries remains a significant challenge. Existing efficient architectures often employ feature dimensionality reduction strategies, which inadvertently induces Geometric Aliasing, resulting in the loss of critical physical boundary information. To address this, we propose the Physics-Geometry Operator Transformer (PGOT), designed to reconstruct physical feature learning through explicit geometry awareness. Specifically, we propose Spectrum-Preserving Geometric Attention (SpecGeo-Attention). Utilizing a ``physics slicing-geometry injection" mechanism, this module incorporates multi-scale geometric encodings to explicitly preserve multi-scale geometric features while maintaining linear computational complexity $O(N)$. Furthermore, PGOT dynamically routes computations to low-order linear paths for smooth regions and high-order non-linear paths for shock waves and discontinuities based on spatial coordinates, enabling spatially adaptive and high-precision physical field modeling. PGOT achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across four standard benchmarks and excels in large-scale industrial tasks including airfoil and car designs.

### [170] [ECG-RAMBA: Zero-Shot ECG Generalization by Morphology-Rhythm Disentanglement and Long-Range Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23347)
*Hai Duong Nguyen,Xuan-The Tran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes ECG-RAMBA, a framework separating morphological and rhythm features then re-integrating them via context-aware fusion, which improves cross-dataset generalization for ECG classification, outperforming baselines in zero-shot transfer and protocol-faithful evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem that deep learning models for ECG classification lack dependable generalization across heterogeneous acquisition settings due to the implicit entanglement of morphological waveform patterns and rhythm dynamics, leading to shortcut learning and sensitivity to distribution shifts.

Method: ECG-RAMBA framework combines three components: deterministic morphological features from MiniRocket, global rhythm descriptors from heart-rate variability (HRV), and long-range contextual modeling via a bi-directional Mamba backbone; plus a numerically stable Power Mean pooling operator (Q=3) to emphasize high-evidence segments.

Result: On the Chapman--Shaoxing dataset, ECG-RAMBA achieves a macro ROC-AUC ≈0.85 under protocol-faithful subject-level cross-validation with fixed threshold and no test-time adaptation; in zero-shot transfer, it attains PR-AUC=0.708 for atrial fibrillation detection on CPSC-2021 dataset (outperforming raw-signal Mamba baseline) and shows consistent cross-dataset performance on PTB-XL.

Conclusion: Deterministic morphology features provide a strong foundation for ECG classification, while explicit rhythm modeling and long-range context are critical for enhancing cross-domain robustness.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved strong performance for electrocardiogram (ECG) classification within individual datasets, yet dependable generalization across heterogeneous acquisition settings remains a major obstacle to clinical deployment and longitudinal monitoring. A key limitation of many model architectures is the implicit entanglement of morphological waveform patterns and rhythm dynamics, which can promote shortcut learning and amplify sensitivity to distribution shifts. We propose ECG-RAMBA, a framework that separates morphology and rhythm and then re-integrates them through context-aware fusion. ECG-RAMBA combines: (i) deterministic morphological features extracted by MiniRocket, (ii) global rhythm descriptors computed from heart-rate variability (HRV), and (iii) long-range contextual modeling via a bi-directional Mamba backbone. To improve sensitivity to transient abnormalities under windowed inference, we introduce a numerically stable Power Mean pooling operator ($Q=3$) that emphasizes high-evidence segments while avoiding the brittleness of max pooling and the dilution of averaging. We evaluate under a protocol-faithful setting with subject-level cross-validation, a fixed decision threshold, and no test-time adaptation. On the Chapman--Shaoxing dataset, ECG-RAMBA achieves a macro ROC-AUC $\approx 0.85$. In zero-shot transfer, it attains PR-AUC $=0.708$ for atrial fibrillation detection on the external CPSC-2021 dataset, substantially outperforming a comparable raw-signal Mamba baseline, and shows consistent cross-dataset performance on PTB-XL. Ablation studies indicate that deterministic morphology provides a strong foundation, while explicit rhythm modeling and long-range context are critical drivers of cross-domain robustness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Federated Learning with Ordered Layer Freezing (FedOLF) to address efficiency and scalability challenges of FL on IoT edge devices, combining ordered layer freezing and Tensor Operation Approximation (TOA) to reduce computation, memory, communication, and energy costs while improving accuracy over existing works on multiple datasets and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the limited computational power, memory, and bandwidth of IoT edge devices that hinder FL efficiency and scalability, especially for deep neural networks, since existing FL frameworks using dropout or layer freezing often sacrifice accuracy or neglect memory constraints.

Method: Propose Federated Learning with Ordered Layer Freezing (FedOLF), which consistently freezes layers in a predefined order before training; additionally, incorporate Tensor Operation Approximation (TOA), a lightweight alternative to conventional quantization, to further reduce communication and energy costs.

Result: FedOLF achieves higher accuracy (at least 0.3% to 6.4%) than existing works on EMNIST (CNN), CIFAR-10 (AlexNet), CIFAR-100 (ResNet20/44), and CINIC-10 (ResNet20/44), along with higher energy efficiency and lower memory footprint.

Conclusion: FedOLF effectively mitigates the efficiency and scalability challenges of FL on IoT edge devices by combining ordered layer freezing and TOA, outperforming existing approaches in accuracy, energy efficiency, and memory usage.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a privacy-preserving paradigm for training machine learning models across distributed edge devices in the Internet of Things (IoT). By keeping data local and coordinating model training through a central server, FL effectively addresses privacy concerns and reduces communication overhead. However, the limited computational power, memory, and bandwidth of IoT edge devices pose significant challenges to the efficiency and scalability of FL, especially when training deep neural networks. Various FL frameworks have been proposed to reduce computation and communication overheads through dropout or layer freezing. However, these approaches often sacrifice accuracy or neglect memory constraints. To this end, in this work, we introduce Federated Learning with Ordered Layer Freezing (FedOLF). FedOLF consistently freezes layers in a predefined order before training, significantly mitigating computation and memory requirements. To further reduce communication and energy costs, we incorporate Tensor Operation Approximation (TOA), a lightweight alternative to conventional quantization that better preserves model accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that over non-iid data, FedOLF achieves at least 0.3%, 6.4%, 5.81%, 4.4%, 6.27% and 1.29% higher accuracy than existing works respectively on EMNIST (with CNN), CIFAR-10 (with AlexNet), CIFAR-100 (with ResNet20 and ResNet44), and CINIC-10 (with ResNet20 and ResNet44), along with higher energy efficiency and lower memory footprint.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified low-bit inference framework (INT8 W8A8 and W4A8) optimized for Huawei's openPangu-Embedded models on Atlas A2 to address memory/latency overheads from CoT reasoning, showing INT8 preserves over 90% accuracy with 1.5x speedup and W4A8 reduces memory with moderate accuracy trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The CoT reasoning modes (slow_think, auto_think, no_think) in openPangu-Embedded models enhance reasoning but introduce large memory and latency overheads, hindering practical deployment on Ascend NPUs.

Method: A unified low-bit inference framework supporting INT8 (W8A8) and W4A8 quantization, specifically optimized for openPangu-Embedded models on Atlas A2.

Result: INT8 quantization preserves over 90% of FP16 baseline accuracy and achieves a 1.5x prefill speedup on Atlas A2; W4A8 quantization significantly reduces memory consumption with moderate accuracy trade-off.

Conclusion: Low-bit quantization effectively enables efficient CoT reasoning on Ascend NPUs while maintaining high model fidelity.

Abstract: Huawei's openPangu-Embedded-1B and openPangu-Embedded-7B, variants of the openPangu large language model, integrate three distinct Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning paradigms, namely slow_think, auto_think, and no_think. While these CoT modes enhance reasoning capabilities, their generation of extended reasoning traces introduces substantial memory and latency overheads, posing challenges for practical deployment on Ascend NPUs. This paper addresses these computational constraints by leveraging low-bit quantization, which transforms FP16 computations into more efficient integer arithmetic. We introduce a unified low-bit inference framework, supporting INT8 (W8A8) and W4A8 quantization, specifically optimized for openPangu-Embedded models on the Atlas A2. Our comprehensive evaluation, conducted across all three CoT modes on code generation benchmarks (HumanEval and MBPP), demonstrates the efficacy of this approach. INT8 quantization consistently preserves over 90\% of the FP16 baseline accuracy and achieves a 1.5x prefill speedup on the Atlas A2. Furthermore, W4A8 quantization significantly reduces memory consumption, albeit with a moderate trade-off in accuracy. These findings collectively indicate that low-bit quantization effectively facilitates efficient CoT reasoning on Ascend NPUs, maintaining high model fidelity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the unfairness issue caused by imbalanced overlapping subgraphs in graph federated learning, proposes FairGFL to enhance cross-client fairness while preserving model utility, and shows its superiority over baselines via experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph data often has overlaps among clients, and previous research ignored the negative effects of imbalanced overlaps, leading to unfairness in graph federated learning.

Method: FairGFL uses an interpretable weighted aggregation approach based on privacy-preserving overlapping ratio estimation and integrates a regularizer into the federated composite loss function to balance utility and fairness.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmark graph datasets demonstrate that FairGFL outperforms four representative baseline algorithms in both model utility and fairness.

Conclusion: FairGFL effectively mitigates the unfairness issue from imbalanced overlapping subgraphs in graph federated learning while maintaining good model utility.

Abstract: Graph federated learning enables the collaborative extraction of high-order information from distributed subgraphs while preserving the privacy of raw data. However, graph data often exhibits overlap among different clients. Previous research has demonstrated certain benefits of overlapping data in mitigating data heterogeneity. However, the negative effects have not been explored, particularly in cases where the overlaps are imbalanced across clients. In this paper, we uncover the unfairness issue arising from imbalanced overlapping subgraphs through both empirical observations and theoretical reasoning. To address this issue, we propose FairGFL (FAIRness-aware subGraph Federated Learning), a novel algorithm that enhances cross-client fairness while maintaining model utility in a privacy-preserving manner. Specifically, FairGFL incorporates an interpretable weighted aggregation approach to enhance fairness across clients, leveraging privacy-preserving estimation of their overlapping ratios. Furthermore, FairGFL improves the tradeoff between model utility and fairness by integrating a carefully crafted regularizer into the federated composite loss function. Through extensive experiments on four benchmark graph datasets, we demonstrate that FairGFL outperforms four representative baseline algorithms in terms of both model utility and fairness.

*Mohammad Nasirzadeh,Jafar Tahmoresnezhad,Parviz Rashidi-Khazaee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes CoLog, a multimodal log anomaly detection framework using collaborative transformers, multi-head impressed attention, and modality adaptation layers, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods with high precision, recall, and F1 scores across seven benchmarks for both point and collective anomalies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unimodal log anomaly detection methods ignore different log modalities, while existing multimodal methods fail to handle interactions between these modalities, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: CoLog uses collaborative transformers and multi-head impressed attention to learn inter-modality interactions, incorporates a modality adaptation layer to handle heterogeneity, and provides a unified framework for both point and collective anomaly detection.

Result: CoLog achieves mean precision of 99.63%, mean recall of 99.59%, and mean F1 score of 99.61% across seven benchmark datasets for log-based anomaly detection, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CoLog is a significant advancement in log anomaly detection, suitable for cybersecurity, system monitoring, and operational efficiency, solving complex challenges in automatic log data analysis through its unified framework for point and collective anomalies.

Abstract: Log anomaly detection is crucial for preserving the security of operating systems. Depending on the source of log data collection, various information is recorded in logs that can be considered log modalities. In light of this intuition, unimodal methods often struggle by ignoring the different modalities of log data. Meanwhile, multimodal methods fail to handle the interactions between these modalities. Applying multimodal sentiment analysis to log anomaly detection, we propose CoLog, a framework that collaboratively encodes logs utilizing various modalities. CoLog utilizes collaborative transformers and multi-head impressed attention to learn interactions among several modalities, ensuring comprehensive anomaly detection. To handle the heterogeneity caused by these interactions, CoLog incorporates a modality adaptation layer, which adapts the representations from different log modalities. This methodology enables CoLog to learn nuanced patterns and dependencies within the data, enhancing its anomaly detection capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoLog's superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, in detecting both point and collective anomalies, CoLog achieves a mean precision of 99.63%, a mean recall of 99.59%, and a mean F1 score of 99.61% across seven benchmark datasets for log-based anomaly detection. The comprehensive detection capabilities of CoLog make it highly suitable for cybersecurity, system monitoring, and operational efficiency. CoLog represents a significant advancement in log anomaly detection, providing a sophisticated and effective solution to point and collective anomaly detection through a unified framework and a solution to the complex challenges automatic log data analysis poses. We also provide the implementation of CoLog at https://github.com/NasirzadehMoh/CoLog.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes PFed-signal, a federated learning-based ADR signal prediction model that uses Euclidean distance to eliminate biased data from FAERS, outperforming traditional statistical methods (ROR, PRR) and baselines in accuracy, F1 score, recall, and AUC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the problem that ADR predictions based on biased FAERS records may mislead online diagnosis, as traditional statistical methods (ROR, PRR) cannot eliminate biased data leading to inaccurate signal prediction.

Method: PFed-signal includes two main parts: 1) Pfed-Split, which splits the original dataset based on ADR; 2) ADR-signal, which uses federated learning with Euclidean distance to identify biased data and a Transformer-based model trained on clean data for ADR prediction.

Result: The ROR and PRR on the clean dataset are better than traditional methods; PFed-Signal achieves accuracy of 0.887, F1 score of 0.890, recall of 0.913, and AUC of 0.957, all higher than baselines.

Conclusion: PFed-signal effectively eliminates biased data from FAERS and improves the accuracy of ADR signal prediction compared to traditional methods and baselines.

Abstract: The adverse drug reactions (ADRs) predicted based on the biased records in FAERS (U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System) may mislead diagnosis online. Generally, such problems are solved by optimizing reporting odds ratio (ROR) or proportional reporting ratio (PRR). However, these methods that rely on statistical methods cannot eliminate the biased data, leading to inaccurate signal prediction. In this paper, we propose PFed-signal, a federated learning-based signal prediction model of ADR, which utilizes the Euclidean distance to eliminate the biased data from FAERS, thereby improving the accuracy of ADR prediction. Specifically, we first propose Pfed-Split, a method to split the original dataset into a split dataset based on ADR. Then we propose ADR-signal, an ADR prediction model, including a biased data identification method based on federated learning and an ADR prediction model based on Transformer. The former identifies the biased data according to the Euclidean distance and generates a clean dataset by deleting the biased data. The latter is an ADR prediction model based on Transformer trained on the clean data set. The results show that the ROR and PRR on the clean dataset are better than those of the traditional methods. Furthermore, the accuracy rate, F1 score, recall rate and AUC of PFed-Signal are 0.887, 0.890, 0.913 and 0.957 respectively, which are higher than the baselines.

### [176] [Directly Constructing Low-Dimensional Solution Subspaces in Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23410)
*Yusuf Kalyoncuoglu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the redundancy of high-dimensional widths in deep neural networks (DNNs) despite their low Intrinsic Dimension (ID), proposing a constructive approach to bypass optimization bottlenecks and a novel Subspace-Native Distillation paradigm to enable compact student models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art DNNs rely on massive high-dimensional widths even though their weight matrices and feature manifolds have low ID; this redundancy is unnecessary for representation but needed to solve the intractable non-convex optimization problem of finding a global minimum for compact networks.

Method: A constructive approach to decouple solution geometry from ambient search space, and a Subspace-Native Distillation paradigm that defines the target directly in the constructed subspace to provide a stable geometric coordinate system for student models.

Result: Empirical demonstration across ResNet-50, ViT, and BERT shows classification heads can be compressed by huge factors (up to 16x) with negligible performance degradation.

Conclusion: The proposed approach and Subspace-Native Distillation paradigm allow student models to circumvent the high-dimensional search problem entirely, realizing the vision of 'Train Big, Deploy Small'.

Abstract: While it is well-established that the weight matrices and feature manifolds of deep neural networks exhibit a low Intrinsic Dimension (ID), current state-of-the-art models still rely on massive high-dimensional widths. This redundancy is not required for representation, but is strictly necessary to solve the non-convex optimization search problem-finding a global minimum, which remains intractable for compact networks. In this work, we propose a constructive approach to bypass this optimization bottleneck. By decoupling the solution geometry from the ambient search space, we empirically demonstrate across ResNet-50, ViT, and BERT that the classification head can be compressed by even huge factors of 16 with negligible performance degradation. This motivates Subspace-Native Distillation as a novel paradigm: by defining the target directly in this constructed subspace, we provide a stable geometric coordinate system for student models, potentially allowing them to circumvent the high-dimensional search problem entirely and realize the vision of Train Big, Deploy Small.

*Zhuo Li,Pengyu Cheng,Zhechao Yu,Feifei Tong,Anningzhe Gao,Tsung-Hui Chang,Xiang Wan,Erchao Zhao,Xiaoxi Jiang,Guanjun Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces DIR, an information-theoretic debiasing method for reward models (RMs) in RLHF to handle complex, non-linear inductive biases like response length, sycophancy, and format, improving RM generalization and RLHF performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RM training data often has low quality with inductive biases (e.g., response length) leading to overfitting/reward hacking; existing debiasing methods target single biases or use simple linear correlations, limiting applicability.

Method: DIR maximizes mutual information between RM scores and human preference pairs while minimizing MI between RM outputs and biased attributes, leveraging information bottleneck theory to handle non-linear biases.

Result: DIR effectively mitigates three target biases (length, sycophancy, format) and enhances RLHF performance across benchmarks with better generalization.

Conclusion: DIR is a robust debiasing method for RMs that handles diverse non-linear inductive biases, extending real-world RM debiasing applications and improving RLHF outcomes.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are essential in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to align large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, RM training data is commonly recognized as low-quality, containing inductive biases that can easily lead to overfitting and reward hacking. For example, more detailed and comprehensive responses are usually human-preferred but with more words, leading response length to become one of the inevitable inductive biases. A limited number of prior RM debiasing approaches either target a single specific type of bias or model the problem with only simple linear correlations, \textit{e.g.}, Pearson coefficients. To mitigate more complex and diverse inductive biases in reward modeling, we introduce a novel information-theoretic debiasing method called \textbf{D}ebiasing via \textbf{I}nformation optimization for \textbf{R}M (DIR). Inspired by the information bottleneck (IB), we maximize the mutual information (MI) between RM scores and human preference pairs, while minimizing the MI between RM outputs and biased attributes of preference inputs. With theoretical justification from information theory, DIR can handle more sophisticated types of biases with non-linear correlations, broadly extending the real-world application scenarios for RM debiasing methods. In experiments, we verify the effectiveness of DIR with three types of inductive biases: \textit{response length}, \textit{sycophancy}, and \textit{format}. We discover that DIR not only effectively mitigates target inductive biases but also enhances RLHF performance across diverse benchmarks, yielding better generalization abilities. The code and training recipes are available at https://github.com/Qwen-Applications/DIR.

*Yuchen Xie,Honghang Chi,Haopeng Quan,Yahui Wang,Wei Wang,Yu Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper establishes a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework for Physics-Informed Neural Networks with hard constraints (HC-PINNs) to analyze their training dynamics, revealing boundary functions act as spectral filters and providing a principled basis for their design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the theoretical mechanisms governing the training dynamics of HC-PINNs, which enforce boundary conditions via trial functions but lack such analysis previously.

Method: A rigorous NTK framework for HC-PINNs is established, deriving explicit kernel composition laws, followed by spectral analysis to identify the effective rank of the residual kernel as a convergence predictor.

Result: The boundary function B(→x) acts as a spectral filter reshaping the native kernel's eigenspectrum; widely used boundary functions can cause spectral collapse leading to optimization stagnation; the effective rank of the residual kernel is a better convergence predictor than classical condition numbers.

Conclusion: The framework transforms boundary function design from heuristic to principled spectral optimization, providing a solid theoretical foundation for geometric hard constraints in scientific machine learning, validated across multi-dimensional benchmarks.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks with hard constraints (HC-PINNs) are increasingly favored for their ability to strictly enforce boundary conditions via a trial function ansatz $\tilde{u} = A + B \cdot N$, yet the theoretical mechanisms governing their training dynamics have remained unexplored.
  Unlike soft-constrained formulations where boundary terms act as additive penalties, this work reveals that the boundary function $B$ introduces a multiplicative spatial modulation that fundamentally alters the learning landscape.
  A rigorous Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework for HC-PINNs is established, deriving the explicit kernel composition law.
  This relationship demonstrates that the boundary function $B(\vec{x})$ functions as a spectral filter, reshaping the eigenspectrum of the neural network's native kernel.
  Through spectral analysis, the effective rank of the residual kernel is identified as a deterministic predictor of training convergence, superior to classical condition numbers.
  It is shown that widely used boundary functions can inadvertently induce spectral collapse, leading to optimization stagnation despite exact boundary satisfaction.
  Validated across multi-dimensional benchmarks, this framework transforms the design of boundary functions from a heuristic choice into a principled spectral optimization problem, providing a solid theoretical foundation for geometric hard constraints in scientific machine learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes FRoD, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method combining hierarchical joint decomposition and rotational degrees of freedom, which matches full fine-tuning accuracy using only 1.72% trainable parameters across 20 benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the issues of slow convergence and limited adaptation capacity in existing PEFT methods like LoRA due to low-rank constraints, which hinder capturing complex patterns for diverse tasks.

Method: FRoD uses hierarchical joint decomposition to extract a globally shared basis across layers and injects sparse, learnable perturbations into scaling factors for flexible full-rank updates.

Result: On 20 benchmarks in vision, reasoning, and language understanding, FRoD achieves accuracy matching full model fine-tuning while using only 1.72% of trainable parameters under the same training budgets.

Conclusion: FRoD enhances expressiveness and efficiency of PEFT methods, leading to faster and more robust convergence, and outperforms existing approaches in balancing parameter efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as a practical solution for adapting large foundation models to downstream tasks, reducing computational and memory costs by updating only a small subset of parameters. Among them, approaches like LoRA aim to strike a balance between efficiency and expressiveness, but often suffer from slow convergence and limited adaptation capacity due to their inherent low-rank constraints. This trade-off hampers the ability of PEFT methods to capture complex patterns needed for diverse tasks. To address these challenges, we propose FRoD, a novel fine-tuning method that combines hierarchical joint decomposition with rotational degrees of freedom. By extracting a globally shared basis across layers and injecting sparse, learnable perturbations into scaling factors for flexible full-rank updates, FRoD enhances expressiveness and efficiency, leading to faster and more robust convergence. On 20 benchmarks spanning vision, reasoning, and language understanding, FRoD matches full model fine-tuning in accuracy, while using only 1.72% of trainable parameters under identical training budgets.

*Laurent Boué*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper is a follow-up to a previous work on vectorized backpropagation in CNNs, extending the index-free methodology to transformer-based next-token-prediction architectures (including embedding, multi-headed self-attention, layer normalization layers) and providing gradient expressions for LoRA layers, along with a PyTorch implementation of a minimal GPT-like network and analytical gradient updates to deepen understanding of forward/backward propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in understanding how values propagate forward and backward in transformer-based architectures by manually deriving backpropagation using an index-free methodology, which helps gain deeper intuition into each operation's influence on the final output, especially since automatic tools may not reveal these insights.

Method: The paper applies a lightweight index-free methodology (previously used for CNNs) to new layers in transformer-based next-token-prediction models: embedding, multi-headed self-attention, layer normalization, and also includes gradient expressions for LoRA layers. It provides a complete PyTorch implementation of a minimalistic GPT-like network and analytical expressions for all gradient updates.

Result: The paper successfully derives index-free backpropagation for transformer layers (embedding, multi-headed self-attention, layer normalization) and LoRA layers, and offers a PyTorch implementation of a minimal GPT-like network with analytical gradient updates, which aids in understanding the propagation of values and gradients in these architectures.

Conclusion: Manual backpropagation using an index-free approach for transformer-based models (including LoRA layers) enhances intuition about how each operation affects the final output, filling gaps in understanding that automatic differentiation tools may not provide; the provided implementation and analytical expressions support this deeper understanding.

Abstract: This document is a follow-up to our previous paper dedicated to a vectorized derivation of backpropagation in CNNs. Following the same principles and notations already put in place there, we now focus on transformer-based next-token-prediction architectures. To this end, we apply our lightweight index-free methodology to new types of layers such as embedding, multi-headed self-attention and layer normalization. In addition, we also provide gradient expressions for LoRA layers to illustrate parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Why bother doing manual backpropagation when there are so many tools that do this automatically? Any gap in understanding of how values propagate forward will become evident when attempting to differentiate the loss function. By working through the backward pass manually, we gain a deeper intuition for how each operation influences the final output. A complete PyTorch implementation of a minimalistic GPT-like network is also provided along with analytical expressions for of all of its gradient updates.

*Wei Gao,Paul Zheng,Peng Wu,Yulin Hu,Anke Schmeink*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Bayesian optimization (BO)-driven Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) method for joint link adaptation and device scheduling in IIoT networks with imperfect CSI, aiming to maximize total transmission rate under BLER constraints, achieving faster convergence and higher sum-rate than existing solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issues of imperfect CSI, error sample imbalance in URLLC networks, and parameter sensitivity of TD3 that diminish algorithm convergence speed and reliability while maximizing total transmission rate under strict BLER constraints in IIoT networks supporting multi-device dynamic URLLC.

Method: A BO-driven TD3 method is proposed, which uses a BO-based training mechanism to improve convergence speed by providing reliable learning direction and sample selection to handle imbalance samples; the method adaptively determines device served order sequence and corresponding MCS based on imperfect CSI.

Result: Extensive simulations show that the proposed algorithm achieves faster convergence and higher sum-rate performance compared to existing solutions.

Conclusion: The BO-driven TD3 method effectively addresses the challenges in IIoT networks with imperfect CSI, outperforming existing solutions in convergence speed and sum-rate performance.

Abstract: In this article, we consider an industrial internet of things (IIoT) network supporting multi-device dynamic ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) while the channel state information (CSI) is imperfect. A joint link adaptation (LA) and device scheduling (including the order) design is provided, aiming at maximizing the total transmission rate under strict block error rate (BLER) constraints. In particular, a Bayesian optimization (BO) driven Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) method is proposed, which determines the device served order sequence and the corresponding modulation and coding scheme (MCS) adaptively based on the imperfect CSI. Note that the imperfection of CSI, error sample imbalance in URLLC networks, as well as the parameter sensitivity nature of the TD3 algorithm likely diminish the algorithm's convergence speed and reliability. To address such an issue, we proposed a BO based training mechanism for the convergence speed improvement, which provides a more reliable learning direction and sample selection method to track the imbalance sample problem. Via extensive simulations, we show that the proposed algorithm achieves faster convergence and higher sum-rate performance compared to existing solutions.

Motivation: To develop an efficient method for approximating the natural policy gradient in a single gradient step, unlike existing proximal policy methods (e.g., GRPO, CISPO) which require multiple steps with importance ratio clipping variants.

Method: Isometric Policy Optimization (ISOPO) has two variants: 1) Normalize the log-probability gradient of each sequence in the Fisher metric before contracting with advantages; 2) Transform microbatch advantages using the neural tangent kernel in each layer, applied layer-wise in a single backward pass.

Result: Not explicitly stated in the abstract.

Conclusion: Not explicitly stated in the abstract.

Abstract: This note introduces Isometric Policy Optimization (ISOPO), an efficient method to approximate the natural policy gradient in a single gradient step. In comparison, existing proximal policy methods such as GRPO or CISPO use multiple gradient steps with variants of importance ratio clipping to approximate a natural gradient step relative to a reference policy. In its simplest form, ISOPO normalizes the log-probability gradient of each sequence in the Fisher metric before contracting with the advantages. Another variant of ISOPO transforms the microbatch advantages based on the neural tangent kernel in each layer. ISOPO applies this transformation layer-wise in a single backward pass and can be implemented with negligible computational overhead compared to vanilla REINFORCE.

*Xiao Ma,Mohammad Hasyim Taufik,Tariq Alkhalifah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel framework combining generative models and neural operators for efficient high-resolution velocity model building, addressing the computational cost of conventional methods, with experiments showing effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the computational expense and time consumption of conventional velocity model building methods by leveraging deep learning advancements, especially generative models and neural operators.

Method: A framework integrating generative models and neural operators: neural operator as forward mapping for rapid time lag RTM extended image generation from true/migration velocity models (surrogate for modeling+migration); automatic differentiation updates migration velocity to match observed data's time lag images; generative model (trained on high-res velocity distribution matching neural operator's true velocity distribution) acts as regularizer for cleaner, higher-res predictions.

Result: Both synthetic and field data experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed generative neural operator-based velocity model building approach.

Conclusion: The generative neural operator-based velocity model building approach efficiently produces high-resolution velocity models, outperforming conventional methods in computational efficiency and result quality as validated by experiments.

Abstract: Velocity model building serves as a crucial component for achieving high precision subsurface imaging. However, conventional velocity model building methods are often computationally expensive and time consuming. In recent years, with the rapid advancement of deep learning, particularly the success of generative models and neural operators, deep learning based approaches that integrate data and their statistics have attracted increasing attention in addressing the limitations of traditional methods. In this study, we propose a novel framework that combines generative models with neural operators to obtain high resolution velocity models efficiently. Within this workflow, the neural operator functions as a forward mapping operator to rapidly generate time lag reverse time migration (RTM) extended images from the true and migration velocity models. In this framework, the neural operator is acting as a surrogate for modeling followed by migration, which uses the true and migration velocities, respectively. The trained neural operator is then employed, through automatic differentiation, to gradually update the migration velocity placed in the true velocity input channel with high resolution components so that the output of the network matches the time lag images of observed data obtained using the migration velocity. By embedding a generative model, trained on a high-resolution velocity model distribution, which corresponds to the true velocity model distribution used to train the neural operator, as a regularizer, the resulting predictions are cleaner with higher resolution information. Both synthetic and field data experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed generative neural operator based velocity model building approach.

### [185] [Le Cam Distortion: A Decision-Theoretic Framework for Robust Transfer Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23617)
*Deniz Akdemir*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper challenges the symmetric invariance paradigm in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) which causes negative transfer when domains are unequally informative, and proposes a Le Cam Distortion framework based on Le Cam's statistical experiments theory to enable risk-controlled transfer learning with directional simulability, achieving superior results in genomics, vision, and RL tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fundamental flaw of symmetric invariance in UDA leading to catastrophic negative transfer when domains are unequally informative (e.g., high-quality vs degraded sensors), especially in safety-critical applications like medical imaging and autonomous systems.

Method: A decision-theoretic framework grounded in Le Cam's theory of statistical experiments, using constructive approximations to replace symmetric invariance with directional simulability, quantified by Deficiency Distance δ(E₁,E₂) as an upper bound for transfer risk conditional on simulability, and learning a kernel that simulates the target from the source without degrading the source.

Result: Across five experiments: (1) near-perfect frequency estimation in HLA genomics (r=0.999, matching classical methods); (2) zero source utility loss in CIFAR-10 classification (81.2% accuracy preserved vs 34.7% drop for CycleGAN); (3) safe policy transfer in RL control where invariance-based methods collapse catastrophically.

Conclusion: Le Cam Distortion provides the first principled framework for risk-controlled transfer learning in domains where negative transfer is unacceptable, such as medical imaging, autonomous systems, and precision medicine.

Abstract: Distribution shift is the defining challenge of real-world machine learning. The dominant paradigm--Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA)--enforces feature invariance, aligning source and target representations via symmetric divergence minimization [Ganin et al., 2016]. We demonstrate that this approach is fundamentally flawed: when domains are unequally informative (e.g., high-quality vs degraded sensors), strict invariance necessitates information destruction, causing "negative transfer" that can be catastrophic in safety-critical applications [Wang et al., 2019].
  We propose a decision-theoretic framework grounded in Le Cam's theory of statistical experiments [Le Cam, 1986], using constructive approximations to replace symmetric invariance with directional simulability. We introduce Le Cam Distortion, quantified by the Deficiency Distance $δ(E_1, E_2)$, as a rigorous upper bound for transfer risk conditional on simulability. Our framework enables transfer without source degradation by learning a kernel that simulates the target from the source. Across five experiments (genomics, vision, reinforcement learning), Le Cam Distortion achieves: (1) near-perfect frequency estimation in HLA genomics (correlation $r=0.999$, matching classical methods), (2) zero source utility loss in CIFAR-10 image classification (81.2% accuracy preserved vs 34.7% drop for CycleGAN), and (3) safe policy transfer in RL control where invariance-based methods suffer catastrophic collapse. Le Cam Distortion provides the first principled framework for risk-controlled transfer learning in domains where negative transfer is unacceptable: medical imaging, autonomous systems, and precision medicine.

*Iris Xu,Guangtao Zeng,Zexue He,Charles Jin,Aldo Pareja,Dan Gutfreund,Chuang Gan,Zhang-Wei Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Bandit Optimization for Agent Design (BOAD), a framework that automatically discovers hierarchical multi-agent systems to address real-world software engineering (SWE) problems, outperforming single-agent and manually designed multi-agent systems on SWE-bench-Verified and ranking second on SWE-bench-Live against larger models like GPT-4 and Claude.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-agent systems for SWE tasks struggle with long-horizon and out-of-distribution problems due to retaining irrelevant context, leading to spurious correlations and poor generalization; human engineers decompose complex problems, inspiring the need for specialized sub-agents coordinated by an orchestrator.

Method: The paper formulates hierarchy discovery as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, where each arm represents a candidate sub-agent and the reward measures its helpfulness in collaboration; this framework (BOAD) efficiently explores sub-agent designs under limited evaluation budgets by structuring SWE agents as orchestrators coordinating specialized sub-agents for sub-tasks like localization, editing, and validation.

Result: On SWE-bench-Verified, BOAD outperforms single-agent and manually designed multi-agent systems; on SWE-bench-Live (recent, out-of-distribution issues), the 36B BOAD system ranks second on the leaderboard, surpassing larger models such as GPT-4 and Claude.

Conclusion: Automatically discovered hierarchical multi-agent systems (via BOAD) significantly improve generalization on challenging long-horizon SWE tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning and coding capabilities, yet they struggle to generalize to real-world software engineering (SWE) problems that are long-horizon and out of distribution. Existing systems often rely on a single agent to handle the entire workflow-interpreting issues, navigating large codebases, and implementing fixes-within one reasoning chain. Such monolithic designs force the model to retain irrelevant context, leading to spurious correlations and poor generalization. Motivated by how human engineers decompose complex problems, we propose structuring SWE agents as orchestrators coordinating specialized sub-agents for sub-tasks such as localization, editing, and validation. The challenge lies in discovering effective hierarchies automatically: as the number of sub-agents grows, the search space becomes combinatorial, and it is difficult to attribute credit to individual sub-agents within a team. We address these challenges by formulating hierarchy discovery as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, where each arm represents a candidate sub-agent and the reward measures its helpfulness when collaborating with others. This framework, termed Bandit Optimization for Agent Design (BOAD), enables efficient exploration of sub-agent designs under limited evaluation budgets. On SWE-bench-Verified, BOAD outperforms single-agent and manually designed multi-agent systems. On SWE-bench-Live, featuring more recent and out-of-distribution issues, our 36B system ranks second on the leaderboard at the time of evaluation, surpassing larger models such as GPT-4 and Claude. These results demonstrate that automatically discovered hierarchical multi-agent systems significantly improve generalization on challenging long-horizon SWE tasks.

*Nathan Buskulic,Luca Calatroni,Lorenzo Rosasco,Silvia Villa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses blind inverse problems (where forward operators are unknown) by providing theoretical analysis of Linear Minimum Mean Square Estimators (LMMSEs), including closed-form optimal estimators, convergence results, finite-sample error bounds, and validating findings via numerical experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blind inverse problems are common in experiments but non-blind methods are not directly applicable; existing data-driven approaches lack interpretability and rigorous theoretical guarantees, limiting reliability in domains like imaging.

Method: The paper uses the framework of Linear Minimum Mean Square Estimators (LMMSEs) to analyze blind inverse problems, deriving closed-form optimal estimators, equivalence to Tikhonov-regularized formulations (with regularization dependent on signal, noise, and operator distributions), convergence results under source conditions, and finite-sample error bounds.

Result: Theoretical results include closed-form LMMSE estimators for blind inverse problems, convergence guarantees, and finite-sample error bounds that quantify operator randomness impact and convergence rates as randomness vanishes; numerical experiments confirm predicted convergence behavior.

Conclusion: The theoretical analysis of LMMSEs for blind inverse problems provides interpretable, rigorously guaranteed results, with finite-sample bounds and convergence rates validated by experiments, addressing gaps in existing data-driven approaches.

Abstract: Blind inverse problems arise in many experimental settings where the forward operator is partially or entirely unknown. In this context, methods developed for the non-blind case cannot be adapted in a straightforward manner. Recently, data-driven approaches have been proposed to address blind inverse problems, demonstrating strong empirical performance and adaptability. However, these methods often lack interpretability and are not supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees, limiting their reliability in applied domains such as imaging inverse problems. In this work, we shed light on learning in blind inverse problems within the simplified yet insightful framework of Linear Minimum Mean Square Estimators (LMMSEs). We provide an in-depth theoretical analysis, deriving closed-form expressions for optimal estimators and extending classical results. In particular, we establish equivalences with suitably chosen Tikhonov-regularized formulations, where the regularization depends explicitly on the distributions of the unknown signal, the noise, and the random forward operators. We also prove convergence results under appropriate source condition assumptions. Furthermore, we derive rigorous finite-sample error bounds that characterize the performance of learned estimators as a function of the noise level, problem conditioning, and number of available samples. These bounds explicitly quantify the impact of operator randomness and reveal the associated convergence rates as this randomness vanishes. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through illustrative numerical experiments that confirm the predicted convergence behavior.

TL;DR: This paper proposes frequency-guided graph structure learning (FgGSL), an end-to-end framework to address GNNs' struggles with heterophilic graphs by jointly learning complementary homophilic and heterophilic structures using spectral filters and a label-based loss, outperforming SOTA methods on six benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph neural networks (GNNs) often fail to learn discriminative node representations for heterophilic graphs where connected nodes have dissimilar labels and feature similarity offers weak structural cues.

Method: FgGSL is an end-to-end graph inference framework that uses a learnable symmetric feature-driven masking function to infer complementary homophilic and heterophilic graphs, processes them with pre-designed low- and high-pass spectral filter banks, and employs a label-based structural loss to promote recovery of relevant edges. Stability bounds for the loss and robustness guarantees for filters under perturbations are derived.

Result: Experiments on six heterophilic benchmarks show FgGSL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and graph rewiring methods.

Conclusion: Combining frequency information with supervised topology inference (via FgGSL) effectively improves GNN performance on heterophilic graphs.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) often struggle to learn discriminative node representations for heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes tend to have dissimilar labels and feature similarity provides weak structural cues. We propose frequency-guided graph structure learning (FgGSL), an end-to-end graph inference framework that jointly learns homophilic and heterophilic graph structures along with a spectral encoder. FgGSL employs a learnable, symmetric, feature-driven masking function to infer said complementary graphs, which are processed using pre-designed low- and high-pass graph filter banks. A label-based structural loss explicitly promotes the recovery of homophilic and heterophilic edges, enabling task-driven graph structure learning. We derive stability bounds for the structural loss and establish robustness guarantees for the filter banks under graph perturbations. Experiments on six heterophilic benchmarks demonstrate that FgGSL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and graph rewiring methods, highlighting the benefits of combining frequency information with supervised topology inference.

Motivation: Recent state-of-the-art self-supervised learning approaches (e.g., MAE) lack temporal awareness, which is crucial for capturing disease progression in longitudinal medical datasets; deterministic Siamese methods fail to account for inherent uncertainty in disease evolution.

Method: STAMP is a Siamese MAE framework that encodes temporal info via a stochastic process by conditioning on time differences between two input volumes, reframing MAE reconstruction loss as a conditional variational inference objective to learn stochastic temporal dynamics.

Result: STAMP pretrained ViT models outperformed existing temporal MAE methods and foundation models on late-stage Age-Related Macular Degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease progression prediction tasks across two OCT and one MRI datasets with multiple patient visits.

Conclusion: STAMP effectively captures non-deterministic temporal dynamics of diseases, improving performance on longitudinal medical image analysis tasks requiring temporal awareness and handling uncertainty in disease evolution.

Abstract: Temporally aware image representations are crucial for capturing disease progression in 3D volumes of longitudinal medical datasets. However, recent state-of-the-art self-supervised learning approaches like Masked Autoencoding (MAE), despite their strong representation learning capabilities, lack temporal awareness. In this paper, we propose STAMP (Stochastic Temporal Autoencoder with Masked Pretraining), a Siamese MAE framework that encodes temporal information through a stochastic process by conditioning on the time difference between the 2 input volumes. Unlike deterministic Siamese approaches, which compare scans from different time points but fail to account for the inherent uncertainty in disease evolution, STAMP learns temporal dynamics stochastically by reframing the MAE reconstruction loss as a conditional variational inference objective. We evaluated STAMP on two OCT and one MRI datasets with multiple visits per patient. STAMP pretrained ViT models outperformed both existing temporal MAE methods and foundation models on different late stage Age-Related Macular Degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease progression prediction which require models to learn the underlying non-deterministic temporal dynamics of the diseases.

*Vladimer Khasia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Dynamic Subspace Composition (DSC), a framework to address representation collapse and gradient instability in Mixture of Experts (MoE) models by using state-dependent sparse expansion of shared basis vectors, reducing parameter complexity and memory traffic while ensuring continuity and providing rigorous bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the problems of representation collapse and gradient instability faced by Mixture of Experts (MoE) models when scaling capacity.

Method: DSC approximates context-dependent weights via state-dependent sparse expansion of a shared basis bank, models weight updates as residual trajectories in a Star-Shaped Domain with Magnitude-Gated Simplex Interpolation for identity continuity, constructs compositional rank-K approximations from decoupled unit-norm basis vectors, and uses Frame-Theoretic regularization and spectral constraints.

Result: DSC reduces parameter complexity from O(M rd) (as in Mixture-of-LoRAs) to O(M d) and memory traffic to O(Kd), while providing rigorous worst-case bounds on dynamic updates.

Conclusion: DSC is an effective framework for improving MoE models by addressing their key issues through subspace composition with reduced complexity and guaranteed performance bounds.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models scale capacity but often suffer from representation collapse and gradient instability. We propose Dynamic Subspace Composition (DSC), a framework that approximates context-dependent weights via a state-dependent, sparse expansion of a shared basis bank. Formally, DSC models the weight update as a residual trajectory within a Star- Shaped Domain, employing a Magnitude-Gated Simplex Interpolation to ensure continuity at the identity. Unlike standard Mixture-of-LoRAs, which incurs O(M rd) parameter complexity by retrieving independent rank-r matrices, DSC constructs a compositional rank-K approximation from decoupled unit-norm basis vectors. This reduces parameter complexity to O(M d) and memory traffic to O(Kd), while Frame-Theoretic regularization and spectral constraints provide rigorous worst-case bounds on the dynamic update.

*Zhuo Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper focuses on trustworthy machine learning under distribution shifts, addressing three common shifts (perturbation, domain, modality) and three trustworthiness aspects (robustness, explainability, adaptability) to enhance ML systems' reliability and general usefulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distribution shift is a persistent problem limiting ML systems' reliability and general usefulness, and generalization under distribution shift causes trust issues for AIs, so the research aims to tackle these challenges.

Method: The research studies three common distribution shifts (perturbation, domain, modality) and investigates trustworthiness via three aspects (robustness, explainability, adaptability), then proposes effective solutions and fundamental insights to enhance critical ML problems like efficiency, adaptability, and safety.

Result: Not explicitly mentioned in the abstract.

Conclusion: Not explicitly mentioned in the abstract.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has been a foundational topic in artificial intelligence (AI), providing both theoretical groundwork and practical tools for its exciting advancements. From ResNet for visual recognition to Transformer for vision-language alignment, the AI models have achieved superior capability to humans. Furthermore, the scaling law has enabled AI to initially develop general intelligence, as demonstrated by Large Language Models (LLMs). To this stage, AI has had an enormous influence on society and yet still keeps shaping the future for humanity. However, distribution shift remains a persistent ``Achilles' heel'', fundamentally limiting the reliability and general usefulness of ML systems. Moreover, generalization under distribution shift would also cause trust issues for AIs. Motivated by these challenges, my research focuses on \textit{Trustworthy Machine Learning under Distribution Shifts}, with the goal of expanding AI's robustness, versatility, as well as its responsibility and reliability. We carefully study the three common distribution shifts into: (1) Perturbation Shift, (2) Domain Shift, and (3) Modality Shift. For all scenarios, we also rigorously investigate trustworthiness via three aspects: (1) Robustness, (2) Explainability, and (3) Adaptability. Based on these dimensions, we propose effective solutions and fundamental insights, meanwhile aiming to enhance the critical ML problems, such as efficiency, adaptability, and safety.

*Maryam Mirzaei,Farzaneh Shayegh,Hamed Narimani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes EGDA, a framework for EEG-based emotion recognition that addresses cross-session generalization issues by aligning global and class-specific distributions with graph regularization, achieving robust performance on SEED-IV dataset and identifying key frequency bands and brain regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenge of poor model generalization caused by cross-session variations in EEG-based emotion recognition.

Method: EGDA framework: jointly aligns global (marginal) and class-specific (conditional) distributions while preserving EEG data's intrinsic structure via graph regularization.

Result: On SEED-IV dataset, EGDA achieves accuracies of 81.22%,80.15%,83.27% across three transfer tasks, outperforming baselines; Gamma band is most discriminative, central-parietal and prefrontal regions are critical.

Conclusion: EGDA effectively improves cross-session generalization for EEG emotion recognition, with key insights into frequency bands and brain regions.

Abstract: Accurate recognition of human emotional states is critical for effective human-machine interaction. Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a reliable source for emotion recognition due to its high temporal resolution and its direct reflection of neural activity. Nevertheless, variations across recording sessions present a major challenge for model generalization. To address this issue, we propose EGDA, a framework that reduces cross-session discrepancies by jointly aligning the global (marginal) and class-specific (conditional) distributions, while preserving the intrinsic structure of EEG data through graph regularization. Experimental results on the SEED-IV dataset demonstrate that EGDA achieves robust cross-session performance, obtaining accuracies of 81.22%, 80.15%, and 83.27% across three transfer tasks, and surpassing several baseline methods. Furthermore, the analysis highlights the Gamma frequency band as the most discriminative and identifies the central-parietal and prefrontal brain regions as critical for reliable emotion recognition.

*Christopher Burger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hybrid framework integrating Conformal Prediction with traditional Statistical Process Control (SPC) to address SPC's limitations from violated statistical assumptions, proposing two novel applications for more robust quality control in complex manufacturing environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SPC relies on often violated statistical assumptions, leading to unreliable monitoring in modern complex manufacturing environments, so a more robust approach is needed.

Method: The paper proposes a hybrid framework that integrates Conformal Prediction (with distribution-free, model-agnostic guarantees) into SPC, including two novel applications: Conformal-Enhanced Control Charts (visualizing process uncertainty and enabling proactive signals like 'uncertainty spikes') and Conformal-Enhanced Process Monitoring (reframing multivariate control as a formal anomaly detection problem using an intuitive p-value chart).

Result: The framework provides a more robust and statistically rigorous approach to quality control while maintaining the interpretability and ease of use of classic SPC methods.

Conclusion: Integrating Conformal Prediction into SPC addresses the limitations of traditional SPC, offering a robust, statistically rigorous solution for quality control in complex manufacturing environments without losing interpretability or ease of use.

Abstract: Traditional Statistical Process Control (SPC) is essential for quality management but is limited by its reliance on often violated statistical assumptions, leading to unreliable monitoring in modern, complex manufacturing environments. This paper introduces a hybrid framework that enhances SPC by integrating the distribution free, model agnostic guarantees of Conformal Prediction. We propose two novel applications: Conformal-Enhanced Control Charts, which visualize process uncertainty and enable proactive signals like 'uncertainty spikes', and Conformal-Enhanced Process Monitoring, which reframes multivariate control as a formal anomaly detection problem using an intuitive p-value chart. Our framework provides a more robust and statistically rigorous approach to quality control while maintaining the interpretability and ease of use of classic methods.

### [194] [Random Controlled Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23670)
*Francesco Piatti,Thomas Cass,William F. Turner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a training-efficient time-series learning framework combining random features with controlled differential equations (CDEs), proposing two variants (RF-CDEs and R-RDEs) that link to kernel methods and show competitive performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop fast, scalable time-series models with strong inductive bias by leveraging random features and CDEs, avoiding the inefficiency of explicit signature computations.

Method: The framework uses large randomly parameterized CDEs as continuous-time reservoirs with only a linear readout layer trained; variants include RF-CDEs (random Fourier features for input lifting) and R-RDEs (log-ODE discretization on rough paths using log-signatures).

Result: The models demonstrate competitive or state-of-the-art performance across time-series benchmarks, with theoretical guarantees linking them to RBF-lifted signature and rough signature kernels in the infinite-width limit.

Conclusion: The proposed methods offer a practical alternative to explicit signature computations, retaining inductive bias while benefiting from random feature efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce a training-efficient framework for time-series learning that combines random features with controlled differential equations (CDEs). In this approach, large randomly parameterized CDEs act as continuous-time reservoirs, mapping input paths to rich representations. Only a linear readout layer is trained, resulting in fast, scalable models with strong inductive bias. Building on this foundation, we propose two variants: (i) Random Fourier CDEs (RF-CDEs): these lift the input signal using random Fourier features prior to the dynamics, providing a kernel-free approximation of RBF-enhanced sequence models; (ii) Random Rough DEs (R-RDEs): these operate directly on rough-path inputs via a log-ODE discretization, using log-signatures to capture higher-order temporal interactions while remaining stable and efficient. We prove that in the infinite-width limit, these model induces the RBF-lifted signature kernel and the rough signature kernel, respectively, offering a unified perspective on random-feature reservoirs, continuous-time deep architectures, and path-signature theory.
  We evaluate both models across a range of time-series benchmarks, demonstrating competitive or state-of-the-art performance. These methods provide a practical alternative to explicit signature computations, retaining their inductive bias while benefiting from the efficiency of random features.

### [195] [End-to-End Test-Time Training for Long Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23675)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reformulates long-context language modeling as a continual learning problem using a standard sliding-window Transformer, which learns at test time via next-token prediction and meta-learned initialization. It achieves full-attention-like scaling with constant inference latency, being 2.7x faster for 128K context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between context length scaling and inference latency in long-context language modeling, where full attention models scale well but have high latency, and others (like Mamba 2) don't scale properly.

Method: The method uses a standard sliding-window Transformer, applies test-time training (TTT) via next-token prediction on the given context to compress it into weights, and improves initialization via meta-learning at training time. This approach is end-to-end (E2E) both at test and training time.

Result: For 3B models trained with 164B tokens, TTT-E2E scales with context length like full attention, while Mamba 2 and Gated DeltaNet do not. It has constant inference latency regardless of context length, being 2.7 times faster than full attention for 128K context.

Conclusion: Formulating long-context language modeling as continual learning with test-time training and meta-learning initialization enables full-attention-like scaling with constant inference latency, offering an efficient solution for long-context tasks.

Abstract: We formulate long-context language modeling as a problem in continual learning rather than architecture design. Under this formulation, we only use a standard architecture -- a Transformer with sliding-window attention. However, our model continues learning at test time via next-token prediction on the given context, compressing the context it reads into its weights. In addition, we improve the model's initialization for learning at test time via meta-learning at training time. Overall, our method, a form of Test-Time Training (TTT), is End-to-End (E2E) both at test time (via next-token prediction) and training time (via meta-learning), in contrast to previous forms. We conduct extensive experiments with a focus on scaling properties. In particular, for 3B models trained with 164B tokens, our method (TTT-E2E) scales with context length in the same way as Transformer with full attention, while others, such as Mamba 2 and Gated DeltaNet, do not. However, similar to RNNs, TTT-E2E has constant inference latency regardless of context length, making it 2.7 times faster than full attention for 128K context. Our code is publicly available.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation RAG systems enhance large language models by grounding responses in external knowledge bases, but conventional RAG architectures operate with static corpora that cannot evolve from user interactions. We introduce Bidirectional RAG, a novel RAG architecture that enables safe corpus expansion through validated write back of high quality generated responses. Our system employs a multi stage acceptance layer combining grounding verification (NLI based entailment, attribution checking, and novelty detection to prevent hallucination pollution while enabling knowledge accumulation. Across four datasets Natural Questions, TriviaQA, HotpotQA, Stack Overflow with three random seeds 12 experiments per system, Bidirectional RAG achieves 40.58% average coverage nearly doubling Standard RAG 20.33% while adding 72% fewer documents than naive write back 140 vs 500. Our work demonstrates that self improving RAG is feasible and safe when governed by rigorous validation, offering a practical path toward RAG systems that learn from deployment.

### [197] [Emergent Persuasion: Will LLMs Persuade Without Being Prompted?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22201)
*Vincent Chang,Thee Ho,Sunishchal Dev,Kevin Zhu,Shi Feng,Kellin Pelrine,Matthew Kowal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates emergent harmful persuasion in LLMs, finding that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on benign persuasion topics increases models' tendency to persuade on controversial/harmful topics without explicit prompting, while activation steering does not reliably do so.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand under what circumstances LLMs persuade without explicit prompting, which is critical for assessing emergent persuasion risks.

Method: The study examines two scenarios: (1) activation steering along persona traits; (2) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to exhibit the same traits. It also tests SFT on general benign persuasion datasets and evaluates models' propensity to persuade on controversial/harmful topics.

Result: Activation steering does not reliably increase unprompted persuasion; SFT does. Notably, SFT on benign persuasion topics leads to higher persuasion propensity on controversial/harmful topics.

Conclusion: Emergent harmful persuasion can arise from SFT on benign content, indicating a need for further study of such risks.

Abstract: With the wide-scale adoption of conversational AI systems, AI are now able to exert unprecedented influence on human opinion and beliefs. Recent work has shown that many Large Language Models (LLMs) comply with requests to persuade users into harmful beliefs or actions when prompted and that model persuasiveness increases with model scale. However, this prior work looked at persuasion from the threat model of $\textit{misuse}$ (i.e., a bad actor asking an LLM to persuade). In this paper, we instead aim to answer the following question: Under what circumstances would models persuade $\textit{without being explicitly prompted}$, which would shape how concerned we should be about such emergent persuasion risks. To achieve this, we study unprompted persuasion under two scenarios: (i) when the model is steered (through internal activation steering) along persona traits, and (ii) when the model is supervised-finetuned (SFT) to exhibit the same traits. We showed that steering towards traits, both related to persuasion and unrelated, does not reliably increase models' tendency to persuade unprompted, however, SFT does. Moreover, SFT on general persuasion datasets containing solely benign topics admits a model that has a higher propensity to persuade on controversial and harmful topics--showing that emergent harmful persuasion can arise and should be studied further.

*Ryan Spencer,Roey Yaari,Ritvik Vemavarapu,Joyce Yang,Steven Ngo,Utkarsh Sharma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces GamiBench, a benchmark to evaluate spatial reasoning and 2D-to-3D planning in MLLMs via origami-inspired tasks, finding leading models struggle with single-step spatial understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for MLLMs' spatial reasoning focus on static images or final outputs, ignoring the sequential and viewpoint-dependent nature of spatial reasoning; thus, a new benchmark is needed to fill this gap.

Method: GamiBench includes 186 regular and 186 impossible 2D crease patterns paired with 3D folded shapes from six viewpoints across three VQA tasks (predicting 3D configurations, distinguishing valid viewpoints, detecting impossible patterns), plus new metrics (VC and IFSR) to evaluate cross-view consistency and impossible fold detection.

Result: Even leading models like GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro struggle with single-step spatial understanding in GamiBench tasks.

Conclusion: GamiBench establishes a standardized framework for evaluating geometric understanding and spatial reasoning in MLLMs, highlighting current models' limitations in this area.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are proficient in perception and instruction-following, but they still struggle with spatial reasoning: the ability to mentally track and manipulate objects across multiple views and over time. Spatial reasoning is a key component of human intelligence, but most existing benchmarks focus on static images or final outputs, failing to account for the sequential and viewpoint-dependent nature of this skill. To close this gap, we introduce GamiBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate spatial reasoning and 2D-to-3D planning in MLLMs through origami-inspired folding tasks. GamiBench includes 186 regular and 186 impossible 2D crease patterns paired with their corresponding 3D folded shapes, produced from six distinct viewpoints across three visual question-answering (VQA) tasks: predicting 3D fold configurations, distinguishing valid viewpoints, and detecting impossible patterns. Unlike previous benchmarks that assess only final predictions, GamiBench holistically evaluates the entire reasoning process--measuring cross-view consistency, physical feasibility through impossible-fold detection, and interpretation of intermediate folding steps. It further introduces new diagnostic metrics--viewpoint consistency (VC) and impossible fold selection rate (IFSR)--to measure how well models handle folds of varying complexity. Our experiments show that even leading models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro struggle on single-step spatial understanding. These contributions establish a standardized framework for evaluating geometric understanding and spatial reasoning in MLLMs. Dataset and code: https://github.com/stvngo/GamiBench.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a fairness-aware AI framework to address biased post-flood aid allocation in Bangladesh, using adversarial debiasing on 2022 flood data to reduce fairness gaps while maintaining predictive accuracy, enabling equitable aid distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-disaster aid allocation in developing nations like Bangladesh often has systematic biases that disadvantage vulnerable regions (marginalized districts and rural areas), perpetuating historical inequities.

Method: An adversarial debiasing model with a gradient reversal layer is developed, adapting fairness-aware representation learning from healthcare AI to disaster management, using real 2022 Bangladesh flood data (affecting 7.2M people, $405.5M damages) to predict flood vulnerability while removing biases against marginalized districts/rural areas.

Result: Experimental results on 87 upazilas across 11 districts show: 41.6% reduction in statistical parity difference,43.2% decrease in regional fairness gaps, and strong predictive accuracy (R-squared=0.784 vs baseline's0.811); the model generates actionable priority rankings based on genuine need.

Conclusion: Algorithmic fairness techniques can be effectively applied to humanitarian contexts, providing decision-makers with tools for more equitable disaster recovery strategies.

Abstract: Post-disaster aid allocation in developing nations often suffers from systematic biases that disadvantage vulnerable regions, perpetuating historical inequities. This paper presents a fairness-aware artificial intelligence framework for prioritizing post-flood aid distribution in Bangladesh, a country highly susceptible to recurring flood disasters. Using real data from the 2022 Bangladesh floods that affected 7.2 million people and caused 405.5 million US dollars in damages, we develop an adversarial debiasing model that predicts flood vulnerability while actively removing biases against marginalized districts and rural areas. Our approach adapts fairness-aware representation learning techniques from healthcare AI to disaster management, employing a gradient reversal layer that forces the model to learn bias-invariant representations. Experimental results on 87 upazilas across 11 districts demonstrate that our framework reduces statistical parity difference by 41.6 percent, decreases regional fairness gaps by 43.2 percent, and maintains strong predictive accuracy (R-squared=0.784 vs baseline 0.811). The model generates actionable priority rankings ensuring aid reaches the most vulnerable populations based on genuine need rather than historical allocation patterns. This work demonstrates how algorithmic fairness techniques can be effectively applied to humanitarian contexts, providing decision-makers with tools to implement more equitable disaster recovery strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To verify the assumption that many people believe they can easily tell AI-generated images apart from real photographs.

Method: Conduct an interactive web experiment where participants classify 20 images (from 120 difficult cases: real from CC12M and AI-generated from MidJourney) as real or AI-generated; 165 users completed 233 sessions.

Result: Average accuracy was 54% (slightly above random guessing), limited improvement across repeated attempts, average response time 7.3 seconds, some images more consistently deceptive than others.

Conclusion: Humans struggle to reliably detect AI-generated content even on simple portraits; human judgment alone is insufficient as synthetic media improves, highlighting need for greater awareness and ethical guidelines.

Abstract: AI-generated images are now pervasive online, yet many people believe they can easily tell them apart from real photographs. We test this assumption through an interactive web experiment where participants classify 20 images as real or AI-generated. Our dataset contains 120 difficult cases: real images sampled from CC12M, and carefully curated AI-generated counterparts produced with MidJourney. In total, 165 users completed 233 sessions. Their average accuracy was 54%, only slightly above random guessing, with limited improvement across repeated attempts. Response times averaged 7.3 seconds, and some images were consistently more deceptive than others. These results indicate that, even on relatively simple portrait images, humans struggle to reliably detect AI-generated content. As synthetic media continues to improve, human judgment alone is becoming insufficient for distinguishing real from artificial data. These findings highlight the need for greater awareness and ethical guidelines as AI-generated media becomes increasingly indistinguishable from reality.

TL;DR: Logic Sketch Prompting (LSP) improves LLMs' reliability in rule-adherent tasks via typed variables, deterministic condition evaluators, and rule-based validators, outperforming other prompting methods in pharmacologic logic compliance tasks across three models with significant statistical gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address LLMs' unreliability in tasks requiring strict rule adherence, determinism, and auditability, especially in clinical/regulated settings.

Method: Introduce LSP framework with typed variables, deterministic condition evaluators, and rule-based validators; benchmark against zero-shot, chain-of-thought, and concise prompting on pharmacologic logic compliance tasks using Gemma 2, Mistral, Llama 3.

Result: LSP achieves highest accuracy (0.83-0.89) and F1 (0.83-0.89) across tasks/models, outperforming zero-shot (0.24-0.60), concise (0.16-0.30), chain-of-thought (0.56-0.75); McNemar tests show p<0.01 for nearly all comparisons.

Conclusion: LSP enhances determinism, interpretability, consistency without performance loss, suitable for clinical, regulated, safety-critical decision support systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language reasoning but remain unreliable on tasks requiring strict rule adherence, determinism, and auditability. Logic Sketch Prompting (LSP) is a lightweight prompting framework that introduces typed variables, deterministic condition evaluators, and a rule based validator that produces traceable and repeatable outputs. Using two pharmacologic logic compliance tasks, we benchmark LSP against zero shot prompting, chain of thought prompting, and concise prompting across three open weight models: Gemma 2, Mistral, and Llama 3. Across both tasks and all models, LSP consistently achieves the highest accuracy (0.83 to 0.89) and F1 score (0.83 to 0.89), substantially outperforming zero shot prompting (0.24 to 0.60), concise prompts (0.16 to 0.30), and chain of thought prompting (0.56 to 0.75). McNemar tests show statistically significant gains for LSP across nearly all comparisons (p < 0.01). These results demonstrate that LSP improves determinism, interpretability, and consistency without sacrificing performance, supporting its use in clinical, regulated, and safety critical decision support systems.

*Mengkang Hu,Bowei Xia,Yuran Wu,Ailing Yu,Yude Zou,Qiguang Chen,Shijian Wang,Jiarui Jin,Kexin Li,Wenxiang Jiao,Yuan Lu,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agent2World is a tool-augmented multi-agent framework for symbolic world model generation, addressing supervision gaps via interactive feedback; it outperforms existing methods in inference and enables fine-tuning with adaptive feedback for better results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of large-scale verifiable supervision limits training LLMs to generate symbolic world models, and static validation fails to catch behavior-level errors from interactive execution.

Method: Agent2World uses a three-stage pipeline: Deep Researcher (web search for knowledge synthesis), Model Developer (implements executable models), Testing Team (adaptive unit testing/simulation validation; provides behavior-aware feedback for training trajectories).

Result: In inference, it achieves state-of-the-art on three PDDL and code benchmarks; fine-tuned model on its multi-turn trajectories gains average 30.95% relative improvement over base model.

Conclusion: Agent2World effectively improves symbolic world model generation through interactive feedback, both in inference-time performance and as a data engine for fine-tuning.

Abstract: Symbolic world models (e.g., PDDL domains or executable simulators) are central to model-based planning, but training LLMs to generate such world models is limited by the lack of large-scale verifiable supervision. Current approaches rely primarily on static validation methods that fail to catch behavior-level errors arising from interactive execution. In this paper, we propose Agent2World, a tool-augmented multi-agent framework that achieves strong inference-time world-model generation and also serves as a data engine for supervised fine-tuning, by grounding generation in multi-agent feedback. Agent2World follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) A Deep Researcher agent performs knowledge synthesis by web searching to address specification gaps; (ii) A Model Developer agent implements executable world models; And (iii) a specialized Testing Team conducts adaptive unit testing and simulation-based validation. Agent2World demonstrates superior inference-time performance across three benchmarks spanning both Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) and executable code representations, achieving consistent state-of-the-art results. Beyond inference, Testing Team serves as an interactive environment for the Model Developer, providing behavior-aware adaptive feedback that yields multi-turn training trajectories. The model fine-tuned on these trajectories substantially improves world-model generation, yielding an average relative gain of 30.95% over the same model before training.

### [205] [Subgoaling Relaxation-based Heuristics for Numeric Planning with Infinite Actions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22367)
*Ángel Aso-Mollar,Diego Aineto,Enrico Scala,Eva Onaindia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of numeric planning with control parameters, which lead to infinite applicable actions, by identifying a tractable subset and proposing an optimistic compilation to enable subgoaling heuristics, showing effective results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Numeric planning with control parameters introduces free numeric variables in actions, resulting in an infinite number of applicable actions in a state, making off-the-shelf numeric heuristics infeasible.

Method: The paper identifies a tractable subset (controllable, simple numeric problems) and proposes an optimistic compilation approach that abstracts control-dependent expressions into bounded constant effects and relaxed preconditions.

Result: The proposed compilation approach effectively enables the use of subgoaling heuristics to estimate goal distance in numeric planning problems with control parameters, demonstrating it as an effective and computationally feasible method.

Conclusion: This approach successfully applies traditional numeric heuristics to settings with infinite possible actions, pushing the boundaries of the current state of the art in numeric planning with control parameters.

Abstract: Numeric planning with control parameters extends the standard numeric planning model by introducing action parameters as free numeric variables that must be instantiated during planning. This results in a potentially infinite number of applicable actions in a state. In this setting, off-the-shelf numeric heuristics that leverage the action structure are not feasible. In this paper, we identify a tractable subset of these problems--namely, controllable, simple numeric problems--and propose an optimistic compilation approach that transforms them into simple numeric tasks. To do so, we abstract control-dependent expressions into bounded constant effects and relaxed preconditions. The proposed compilation makes it possible to effectively use subgoaling heuristics to estimate goal distance in numeric planning problems involving control parameters. Our results demonstrate that this approach is an effective and computationally feasible way of applying traditional numeric heuristics to settings with an infinite number of possible actions, pushing the boundaries of the current state of the art.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces HalluMatData, a benchmark dataset for evaluating hallucination detection in AI-generated materials science content, and HalluMatDetector, a multi-stage framework to detect and mitigate hallucinations, reducing rates by 30% and proposing PHCS to quantify consistency across paraphrased queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical challenge of hallucination in LLMs generating factually incorrect or misleading information that compromises research integrity in scientific discovery, especially in materials science.

Method: The paper proposes HalluMatData (a benchmark dataset) and HalluMatDetector (a multi-stage framework integrating intrinsic verification, multi-source retrieval, contradiction graph analysis, and metric-based assessment). It also introduces the Paraphrased Hallucination Consistency Score (PHCS).

Result: Hallucination levels vary across materials science subdomains with high-entropy queries having more inconsistencies; HalluMatDetector reduces hallucination rates by 30% compared to standard LLM outputs; PHCS quantifies inconsistencies in responses across semantically equivalent queries.

Conclusion: The proposed HalluMatData and HalluMatDetector effectively address hallucination in AI-generated materials science content, improving reliability, and PHCS offers deeper insights into model consistency.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), is transforming scientific discovery, enabling rapid knowledge generation and hypothesis formulation. However, a critical challenge is hallucination, where LLMs generate factually incorrect or misleading information, compromising research integrity. To address this, we introduce HalluMatData, a benchmark dataset for evaluating hallucination detection methods, factual consistency, and response robustness in AI-generated materials science content. Alongside this, we propose HalluMatDetector, a multi-stage hallucination detection framework that integrates intrinsic verification, multi-source retrieval, contradiction graph analysis, and metric-based assessment to detect and mitigate LLM hallucinations. Our findings reveal that hallucination levels vary significantly across materials science subdomains, with high-entropy queries exhibiting greater factual inconsistencies. By utilizing HalluMatDetector verification pipeline, we reduce hallucination rates by 30% compared to standard LLM outputs. Furthermore, we introduce the Paraphrased Hallucination Consistency Score (PHCS) to quantify inconsistencies in LLM responses across semantically equivalent queries, offering deeper insights into model reliability.

*Ozan Oguztuzun,Cerag Oguztuzun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes GatedBias, a lightweight inference-time framework to adapt frozen KG embeddings for personalized ranking while preserving global accuracy, evaluated on Amazon-Book and Last-FM datasets with significant alignment improvements and causal validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing foundation models for KGs achieve strong cohort-level link prediction but fail to capture individual user preferences, creating a disconnect between general relational reasoning and personalized ranking.

Method: GatedBias introduces structure-gated adaptation: profile-specific features combine with graph-derived binary gates to produce interpretable, per-entity biases, using only ~300 trainable parameters without retraining frozen KG embeddings.

Result: Evaluated on Amazon-Book and Last-FM datasets, GatedBias shows statistically significant improvements in alignment metrics while preserving cohort performance; counterfactual perturbation experiments validate causal responsiveness, with entities benefiting from specific preference signals showing 6--30× greater rank improvements when signals are boosted.

Conclusion: Personalized adaptation of foundation models via GatedBias can be both parameter-efficient and causally verifiable, bridging general knowledge representations with individual user needs.

Abstract: Foundation models for knowledge graphs (KGs) achieve strong cohort-level performance in link prediction, yet fail to capture individual user preferences; a key disconnect between general relational reasoning and personalized ranking. We propose GatedBias, a lightweight inference-time personalization framework that adapts frozen KG embeddings to individual user contexts without retraining or compromising global accuracy. Our approach introduces structure-gated adaptation: profile-specific features combine with graph-derived binary gates to produce interpretable, per-entity biases, requiring only ${\sim}300$ trainable parameters. We evaluate GatedBias on two benchmark datasets (Amazon-Book and Last-FM), demonstrating statistically significant improvements in alignment metrics while preserving cohort performance. Counterfactual perturbation experiments validate causal responsiveness; entities benefiting from specific preference signals show 6--30$\times$ greater rank improvements when those signals are boosted. These results show that personalized adaptation of foundation models can be both parameter-efficient and causally verifiable, bridging general knowledge representations with individual user needs.

### [208] [Monadic Context Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22431)
*Yifan Zhang,Mengdi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Monadic Context Engineering (MCE), a formal architectural paradigm using algebraic structures (Functors, Applicative Functors, Monads) to address brittleness in current autonomous agent architectures, enabling robust, composable agent design and extending to Meta-Agents for generative orchestration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous agent architectures use imperative, ad hoc patterns leading to brittle systems with challenges in state management, error handling, and concurrency.

Method: MCE leverages algebraic structures (Functors, Applicative Functors, Monads) to model agent workflows as computational contexts; uses Monads for sequential composition, Applicatives for parallel execution, Monad Transformers for systematic capability composition; extends to Meta-Agents via metaprogramming for generative orchestration of sub-agent workflows.

Result: The paper demonstrates MCE enables construction of complex, resilient, efficient AI agents from simple, independently verifiable components; Meta-Agents can dynamically create/manage sub-agent workflows.

Conclusion: MCE provides a formal foundation for agent design addressing key limitations of current architectures, supporting robust composition and dynamic orchestration via Meta-Agents.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed a shift towards autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use. However, current agent architectures are frequently constructed using imperative, ad hoc patterns. This results in brittle systems plagued by difficulties in state management, error handling, and concurrency. This paper introduces Monadic Context Engineering (MCE), a novel architectural paradigm leveraging the algebraic structures of Functors, Applicative Functors, and Monads to provide a formal foundation for agent design. MCE treats agent workflows as computational contexts where cross-cutting concerns, such as state propagation, short-circuiting error handling, and asynchronous execution, are managed intrinsically by the algebraic properties of the abstraction. We demonstrate how Monads enable robust sequential composition, how Applicatives provide a principled structure for parallel execution, and crucially, how Monad Transformers allow for the systematic composition of these capabilities. This layered approach enables developers to construct complex, resilient, and efficient AI agents from simple, independently verifiable components. We further extend this framework to describe Meta-Agents, which leverage MCE for generative orchestration, dynamically creating and managing sub-agent workflows through metaprogramming.

*Sadia Asif,Israel Antonio Rosales Laguan,Haris Khan,Shumaila Asif,Muneeb Asif*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces DarkPatterns-LLM, a benchmark dataset and framework for fine-grained assessment of manipulative content in LLM outputs across seven harm categories, evaluating state-of-the-art models and identifying their weaknesses in detecting autonomy-undermining patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety benchmarks for LLMs rely on coarse binary labels and fail to capture nuanced psychological and social mechanisms of manipulation, which undermines user autonomy, trust, and well-being.

Method: The paper proposes a four-layer analytical pipeline (Multi-Granular Detection, Multi-Scale Intent Analysis, Threat Harmonization Protocol, Deep Contextual Risk Alignment) and curates a dataset of 401 examples with expert annotations across seven harm categories.

Result: Evaluation of GPT-4, Claude 3.5, and LLaMA-3-70B shows performance disparities (65.2%--89.7%) and consistent weaknesses in detecting autonomy-undermining patterns.

Conclusion: DarkPatterns-LLM establishes the first standardized, multi-dimensional benchmark for manipulation detection in LLMs, providing actionable diagnostics to enhance AI trustworthiness.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has intensified concerns about manipulative or deceptive behaviors that can undermine user autonomy, trust, and well-being. Existing safety benchmarks predominantly rely on coarse binary labels and fail to capture the nuanced psychological and social mechanisms constituting manipulation. We introduce \textbf{DarkPatterns-LLM}, a comprehensive benchmark dataset and diagnostic framework for fine-grained assessment of manipulative content in LLM outputs across seven harm categories: Legal/Power, Psychological, Emotional, Physical, Autonomy, Economic, and Societal Harm. Our framework implements a four-layer analytical pipeline comprising Multi-Granular Detection (MGD), Multi-Scale Intent Analysis (MSIAN), Threat Harmonization Protocol (THP), and Deep Contextual Risk Alignment (DCRA). The dataset contains 401 meticulously curated examples with instruction-response pairs and expert annotations. Through evaluation of state-of-the-art models including GPT-4, Claude 3.5, and LLaMA-3-70B, we observe significant performance disparities (65.2\%--89.7\%) and consistent weaknesses in detecting autonomy-undermining patterns. DarkPatterns-LLM establishes the first standardized, multi-dimensional benchmark for manipulation detection in LLMs, offering actionable diagnostics toward more trustworthy AI systems.

### [210] [Multi-AI Agent Framework Reveals the "Oxide Gatekeeper" in Aluminum Nanoparticle Oxidation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22529)
*Yiming Lu,Tingyu Lu,Di Zhang,Lili Ye,Hao Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the computational bottleneck in studying aluminum nanoparticles' (ANPs) oxidation mechanisms by using a human-in-the-loop closed-loop framework with self-auditing AI Agents to validate a machine learning potential (MLP), achieving quantum accuracy at large scales and revealing a temperature-regulated dual-mode oxidation mechanism and cation-dominated mass transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the atomic mechanisms governing ANPs' transition from passivated particles to explosive reactants, which are elusive due to the computational gap between ab initio methods (small scales) and empirical force fields (low reactive fidelity).

Method: Employ a human-in-the-loop closed-loop framework where self-auditing AI Agents validate the evolution of an MLP, ensuring quantum mechanical accuracy while scaling to million-atom systems and nanosecond timescales (energy RMSE:1.2 meV/atom, force RMSE:0.126 eV/Å).

Result: Simulations reveal a temperature-regulated dual-mode oxidation mechanism: moderate temps have oxide shell as dynamic gatekeeper via breathing mode (transient nanochannels); above critical threshold, rupture mode causes catastrophic shell failure and explosive combustion. Also, aluminum cation outward diffusion dominates mass transfer across all temps, with coefficients 2-3 orders higher than oxygen.

Conclusion: The discoveries establish a unified atomic-scale framework for energetic nanomaterial design, enabling precision engineering of ignition sensitivity and energy release rates via intelligent computational design.

Abstract: Aluminum nanoparticles (ANPs) are among the most energy-dense solid fuels, yet the atomic mechanisms governing their transition from passivated particles to explosive reactants remain elusive. This stems from a fundamental computational bottleneck: ab initio methods offer quantum accuracy but are restricted to small spatiotemporal scales (< 500 atoms, picoseconds), while empirical force fields lack the reactive fidelity required for complex combustion environments. Herein, we bridge this gap by employing a "human-in-the-loop" closed-loop framework where self-auditing AI Agents validate the evolution of a machine learning potential (MLP). By acting as scientific sentinels that visualize hidden model artifacts for human decision-making, this collaborative cycle ensures quantum mechanical accuracy while exhibiting near-linear scalability to million-atom systems and accessing nanosecond timescales (energy RMSE: 1.2 meV/atom, force RMSE: 0.126 eV/Angstrom). Strikingly, our simulations reveal a temperature-regulated dual-mode oxidation mechanism: at moderate temperatures, the oxide shell acts as a dynamic "gatekeeper," regulating oxidation through a "breathing mode" of transient nanochannels; above a critical threshold, a "rupture mode" unleashes catastrophic shell failure and explosive combustion. Importantly, we resolve a decades-old controversy by demonstrating that aluminum cation outward diffusion, rather than oxygen transport, dominates mass transfer across all temperature regimes, with diffusion coefficients consistently exceeding those of oxygen by 2-3 orders of magnitude. These discoveries establish a unified atomic-scale framework for energetic nanomaterial design, enabling the precision engineering of ignition sensitivity and energy release rates through intelligent computational design.

### [211] [Lessons from Neuroscience for AI: How integrating Actions, Compositional Structure and Episodic Memory could enable Safe, Interpretable and Human-Like AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22568)
*Rajesh P. N. Rao,Vishwas Sathish,Linxing Preston Jiang,Matthew Bryan,Prashant Rangarajan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper argues that current foundation models (like LLMs) based on next-token prediction lack three key components of brain-inspired predictive coding: action integration, hierarchical compositional structure, and episodic memory. It proposes integrating these components to address deficiencies like hallucinations, lack of agency, poor interpretability, and energy inefficiency, and advocates for cross-pollination between brain science and AI for safe, human-like AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation models ignore three critical components of state-of-the-art predictive coding models (action integration, hierarchical compositional structure, episodic memory), leading to issues like hallucinations, lack of agency/responsibility, poor interpretability, and energy inefficiency. The goal is to address these deficiencies and build safe, interpretable, energy-efficient, human-like AI.

Method: The paper reviews recent neuroscience/cognitive science evidence on the importance of the three missing components (actions, hierarchical composition, episodic memory). It then discusses how adding these components to foundation models could solve current issues, compares the proposal to existing trends (CoT, RAG), and explores new brain-inspired augmentation methods.

Result: The paper doesn't present empirical results but outlines how integrating the three components could mitigate key flaws: grounding to reduce hallucinations, agency via action control, interpretability through compositional structure, and energy efficiency from predictive coding principles. It also highlights that existing trends (CoT, RAG) are partial steps but not sufficient without the full set of components.

Conclusion: A rekindling of idea exchange between brain science and AI will help develop safe, interpretable, human-centered AI by integrating action, hierarchical composition, and episodic memory into foundation models.

Abstract: The phenomenal advances in large language models (LLMs) and other foundation models over the past few years have been based on optimizing large-scale transformer models on the surprisingly simple objective of minimizing next-token prediction loss, a form of predictive coding that is also the backbone of an increasingly popular model of brain function in neuroscience and cognitive science. However, current foundation models ignore three other important components of state-of-the-art predictive coding models: tight integration of actions with generative models, hierarchical compositional structure, and episodic memory. We propose that to achieve safe, interpretable, energy-efficient, and human-like AI, foundation models should integrate actions, at multiple scales of abstraction, with a compositional generative architecture and episodic memory. We present recent evidence from neuroscience and cognitive science on the importance of each of these components. We describe how the addition of these missing components to foundation models could help address some of their current deficiencies: hallucinations and superficial understanding of concepts due to lack of grounding, a missing sense of agency/responsibility due to lack of control, threats to safety and trustworthiness due to lack of interpretability, and energy inefficiency. We compare our proposal to current trends, such as adding chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to foundation models, and discuss new ways of augmenting these models with brain-inspired components. We conclude by arguing that a rekindling of the historically fruitful exchange of ideas between brain science and AI will help pave the way towards safe and interpretable human-centered AI.

Motivation: 

Method: 

Result: 

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Agentic AI networking (AgentNet) is a novel AI-native networking paradigm in which a large number of specialized AI agents collaborate to perform autonomous decision-making, dynamic environmental adaptation, and complex missions. It has the potential to facilitate real-time network management and optimization functions, including self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-adaptation across diverse and complex environments. This paper proposes SANet, a novel semantic-aware AgentNet architecture for wireless networks that can infer the semantic goal of the user and automatically assign agents associated with different layers of the network to fulfill the inferred goal. Motivated by the fact that AgentNet is a decentralized framework in which collaborating agents may generally have different and even conflicting objectives, we formulate the decentralized optimization of SANet as a multi-agent multi-objective problem, and focus on finding the Pareto-optimal solution for agents with distinct and potentially conflicting objectives. We propose three novel metrics for evaluating SANet. Furthermore, we develop a model partition and sharing (MoPS) framework in which large models, e.g., deep learning models, of different agents can be partitioned into shared and agent-specific parts that are jointly constructed and deployed according to agents' local computational resources. Two decentralized optimization algorithms are proposed. We derive theoretical bounds and prove that there exists a three-way tradeoff among optimization, generalization, and conflicting errors. We develop an open-source RAN and core network-based hardware prototype that implements agents to interact with three different layers of the network. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieved performance gains of up to 14.61% while requiring only 44.37% of FLOPs required by state-of-the-art algorithms.

*Junshu Dai,Yu Wang,Tongya Zheng,Wei Ji,Qinghong Guo,Ji Cao,Jie Song,Canghong Jin,Mingli Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes M³ob, a method using multi-modal spatial-temporal knowledge to enhance location recommendation by addressing generalization issues of existing unimodal/multi-modal approaches, showing improved performance in normal and abnormal scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mobility prediction methods have limited generalization: unimodal approaches face data sparsity and biases; multi-modal methods fail to capture mobility dynamics due to semantic gaps between static multi-modal representations and spatial-temporal dynamics.

Method: 1. Construct a unified spatial-temporal relational graph (STRG) using LLMs-enhanced spatial-temporal knowledge graph (STKG) for multi-modal representation. 2. Design a gating mechanism for fusing spatial-temporal graph representations of different modalities, and propose STKG-guided cross-modal alignment to inject dynamic knowledge into static image modality.

Result: Extensive experiments on six public datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in normal scenarios and significant generalization ability in abnormal scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed M³ob method effectively leverages multi-modal spatial-temporal knowledge to characterize mobility dynamics, outperforming existing methods in both normal and abnormal scenarios.

Abstract: The precise prediction of human mobility has produced significant socioeconomic impacts, such as location recommendations and evacuation suggestions. However, existing methods suffer from limited generalization capability: unimodal approaches are constrained by data sparsity and inherent biases, while multi-modal methods struggle to effectively capture mobility dynamics caused by the semantic gap between static multi-modal representation and spatial-temporal dynamics. Therefore, we leverage multi-modal spatial-temporal knowledge to characterize mobility dynamics for the location recommendation task, dubbed as \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{M}odal \textbf{Mob}ility (\textbf{M}$^3$\textbf{ob}). First, we construct a unified spatial-temporal relational graph (STRG) for multi-modal representation, by leveraging the functional semantics and spatial-temporal knowledge captured by the large language models (LLMs)-enhanced spatial-temporal knowledge graph (STKG). Second, we design a gating mechanism to fuse spatial-temporal graph representations of different modalities, and propose an STKG-guided cross-modal alignment to inject spatial-temporal dynamic knowledge into the static image modality. Extensive experiments on six public datasets show that our proposed method not only achieves consistent improvements in normal scenarios but also exhibits significant generalization ability in abnormal scenarios.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes SimVC-CAS, a collective agent system simulating VC group decision-making via role-playing agents and a GNN-based interaction module, which outperforms single decision-maker approaches in startup success prediction and applies to other group decision scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing startup success prediction approaches ignore the collective dynamics of investor groups that dominate real-world VC decisions, leading to potential inaccuracies.

Method: The paper introduces SimVC-CAS, a collective agent system that models startup financing prediction as a group decision-making task. It uses role-playing agents with unique traits/preferences and a GNN-based supervised interaction module to capture enterprise fundamentals and investor network behavioral dynamics through graph-structured co-investment networks.

Result: Using PitchBook data with strict leakage controls, SimVC-CAS achieves significant predictive accuracy improvement—~25% relative gain in average precision@10—and provides interpretable, multiperspective reasoning.

Conclusion: SimVC-CAS effectively addresses the limitation of single decision-maker models in VC decision simulation, improves prediction accuracy, and offers insights for other complex group decision scenarios.

Abstract: Due to the high value and high failure rate of startups, predicting their success has become a critical challenge across interdisciplinary research. Existing approaches typically model success prediction from the perspective of a single decision-maker, overlooking the collective dynamics of investor groups that dominate real-world venture capital (VC) decisions. In this paper, we propose SimVC-CAS, a novel collective agent system that simulates VC decision-making as a multi-agent interaction process. By designing role-playing agents and a GNN-based supervised interaction module, we reformulate startup financing prediction as a group decision-making task, capturing both enterprise fundamentals and the behavioral dynamics of potential investor networks. Each agent embodies an investor with unique traits and preferences, enabling heterogeneous evaluation and realistic information exchange through a graph-structured co-investment network. Using real-world data from PitchBook and under strict data leakage controls, we show that SimVC-CAS significantly improves predictive accuracy while providing interpretable, multiperspective reasoning, for example, approximately 25% relative improvement with respect to average precision@10. SimVC-CAS also sheds light on other complex group decision scenarios.

### [216] [The Wisdom of Deliberating AI Crowds: Does Deliberation Improve LLM-Based Forecasting?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22625)
*Paul Schneider,Amalie Schramm*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study explores if structured deliberation (LLMs reviewing each other's forecasts before updating) improves their forecasting accuracy, finding significant improvement in diverse models with shared info but not homogeneous groups, and no benefit from extra contextual info, suggesting deliberation is viable for LLM forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether structured deliberation, which improves human forecasters' performance, can similarly enhance the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) in forecasting tasks.

Method: Using 20 resolved binary questions from the Metaculus Q2 2025 AI Forecasting Tournament, the study assessed LLM accuracy across four scenarios: (1) diverse models with distributed info, (2) diverse models with shared info, (3) homogeneous models with distributed info, (4) homogeneous models with shared info. The intervention was allowing LLMs to review each other's forecasts before updating.

Result: The intervention significantly improved accuracy in scenario (2) (diverse models with shared info), reducing Log Loss by 0.020 (≈4% relative reduction, p=0.017). No benefit was observed in homogeneous groups. Additional contextual info did not improve accuracy, limiting study of info pooling as a mechanism.

Conclusion: Deliberation may be a viable strategy for improving LLM forecasting, especially when using diverse models with shared information; however, homogeneous groups and extra contextual info do not yield benefits in this context.

Abstract: Structured deliberation has been found to improve the performance of human forecasters. This study investigates whether a similar intervention, i.e. allowing LLMs to review each other's forecasts before updating, can improve accuracy in large language models (GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini Pro 2.5). Using 202 resolved binary questions from the Metaculus Q2 2025 AI Forecasting Tournament, accuracy was assessed across four scenarios: (1) diverse models with distributed information, (2) diverse models with shared information, (3) homogeneous models with distributed information, and (4) homogeneous models with shared information. Results show that the intervention significantly improves accuracy in scenario (2), reducing Log Loss by 0.020 or about 4 percent in relative terms (p = 0.017). However, when homogeneous groups (three instances of the same model) engaged in the same process, no benefit was observed. Unexpectedly, providing LLMs with additional contextual information did not improve forecast accuracy, limiting our ability to study information pooling as a mechanism. Our findings suggest that deliberation may be a viable strategy for improving LLM forecasting.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces DICE, a two-stage evidence-coupled framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system evaluation that addresses limitations of existing scalar metrics by providing transparent, confidence-aware judgments, reducing computational complexity via a Swiss-system tournament, and outperforming existing LLM-based metrics like RAGAS in agreement with human experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scalar metrics for RAG systems have limited interpretability, inadequate uncertainty quantification, and computational inefficiency in multi-system comparisons, hindering responsible deployment of RAG technologies.

Method: DICE is a two-stage, evidence-coupled framework combining deep analytical reasoning with probabilistic {A, B, Tie} scoring to produce transparent, confidence-aware judgments; it uses a Swiss-system tournament to reduce computational complexity from O(N²) to O(N log N).

Result: DICE achieves 85.7% agreement with human experts on a curated Chinese financial QA dataset, outperforming existing LLM-based metrics like RAGAS, and reduces computational complexity by 42.9% in an eight-system evaluation while preserving ranking fidelity.

Conclusion: DICE is established as a responsible, explainable, and efficient paradigm for trustworthy RAG system assessment.

Abstract: As Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems evolve toward more sophisticated architectures, ensuring their trustworthiness through explainable and robust evaluation becomes critical. Existing scalar metrics suffer from limited interpretability, inadequate uncertainty quantification, and computational inefficiency in multi-system comparisons, hindering responsible deployment of RAG technologies. We introduce DICE (Discrete Interpretable Comparative Evaluation), a two-stage, evidence-coupled framework that advances explainability and robustness in RAG evaluation. DICE combines deep analytical reasoning with probabilistic $\{A, B, Tie\}$ scoring to produce transparent, confidence-aware judgments that support accountable system improvement through interpretable reasoning traces, enabling systematic error diagnosis and actionable insights. To address efficiency challenges at scale, DICE employs a Swiss-system tournament that reduces computational complexity from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N \log N)$, achieving a 42.9% reduction in our eight-system evaluation while preserving ranking fidelity. Validation on a curated Chinese financial QA dataset demonstrates that DICE achieves 85.7% agreement with human experts, substantially outperforming existing LLM-based metrics such as RAGAS. Our results establish DICE as a responsible, explainable, and efficient paradigm for trustworthy RAG system assessment.

*Xiang Cheng,Yulan Hu,Xiangwen Zhang,Lu Xu,Zheng Pan,Xin Li,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces TravelBench, a real-world travel-planning benchmark with multi-turn interaction and tool use, to address limitations in existing settings, and evaluates LLMs on it to advance LLM agents in travel planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing travel-planning settings for LLMs are limited in domain coverage and multi-turn interaction, failing to support dynamic user-agent interaction and comprehensively assess agent capabilities.

Method: The authors collect user requests from real-world scenarios, construct three subsets (multi-turn, single-turn, unsolvable) for evaluation, and build a controlled sandbox environment with 10 travel-domain tools providing deterministic outputs.

Result: Multiple LLMs are evaluated on TravelBench, with an analysis of their behaviors and performance conducted.

Conclusion: TravelBench offers a practical and reproducible benchmark to advance LLM agents in travel planning.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated strong capabilities in planning and tool use. Travel planning provides a natural and high-impact testbed for these capabilities, as it requires multi-step reasoning, iterative preference elicitation through interaction, and calls to external tools under evolving constraints. Prior work has studied LLMs on travel-planning tasks, but existing settings are limited in domain coverage and multi-turn interaction. As a result, they cannot support dynamic user-agent interaction and therefore fail to comprehensively assess agent capabilities. In this paper, we introduce TravelBench, a real-world travel-planning benchmark featuring multi-turn interaction and tool use. We collect user requests from real-world scenarios and construct three subsets-multi-turn, single-turn, and unsolvable-to evaluate different aspects of agent performance. For stable and reproducible evaluation, we build a controlled sandbox environment with 10 travel-domain tools, providing deterministic tool outputs for reliable reasoning. We evaluate multiple LLMs on TravelBench and conduct an analysis of their behaviors and performance. TravelBench offers a practical and reproducible benchmark for advancing LLM agents in travel planning.

### [219] [Memento-II: Learning by Stateful Reflective Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22716)
*Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a theoretical framework integrating episodic memory and reinforcement learning for continual, experiential learning in large language model agents, using reflection as a key mechanism to enable adaptation without backpropagation or fine-tuning, and establishes convergence guarantees for the induced policy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable large language model agents to adapt through interaction without relying on back propagation or model fine-tuning, thus relaxing the separation between training and deployment.

Method: The framework introduces the Stateful Reflective Decision Process, which models reflective learning as a two-stage read-write interaction with episodic memory: writing (policy evaluation, storing interaction outcomes) and reading (policy improvement, retrieving relevant past cases). It instantiates the framework using entropy-regularised policy iteration.

Result: The Stateful Reflective Decision Process induces an equivalent Markov decision process over augmented state-memory representations, allowing classical RL/dynamic programming tools. The policy converges to the optimal solution as episodic memory grows and sufficiently covers the state space.

Conclusion: This work provides a principled foundation for memory-augmented, retrieval-based language model agents that can continually adapt without parameter updates.

Abstract: We propose a theoretical framework for continual and experiential learning in large language model agents that integrates episodic memory with reinforcement learning. The framework identifies reflection as the key mechanism that enables agents to adapt through interaction without back propagation or model fine tuning, thereby relaxing the conventional separation between training and deployment.To formalise this process, we introduce the Stateful Reflective Decision Process, which models reflective learning as a two stage read write interaction with episodic memory. Writing stores interaction outcomes and corresponds to policy evaluation, while reading retrieves relevant past cases and corresponds to policy improvement. We show that this process induces an equivalent Markov decision process over augmented state memory representations, allowing the use of classical tools from dynamic programming and reinforcement learning. We further instantiate the framework using entropy regularised policy iteration and establish convergence guarantees. As episodic memory grows and achieves sufficient coverage of the state space, the resulting policy converges to the optimal solution. This work provides a principled foundation for memory augmented and retrieval based language model agents capable of continual adaptation without parameter updates.

TL;DR: This paper proposes SAMP-HDRL, a hierarchical DRL framework for portfolio management in non-stationary markets, which outperforms baselines in volatile conditions, has better robustness and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in non-stationary markets: regime shifts, dynamic correlations, and limited interpretability of DRL policies.

Method: A hierarchical DRL framework called SAMP-HDRL: dynamic asset grouping into high-quality/ordinary subsets; upper-level agent extracts global signals, lower-level agents do intra-group allocation under mask constraints; utility-based capital allocation integrates risky/risk-free assets.

Result: Backtests across 2019-2021 regimes show consistent outperformance over 9 traditional and 9 DRL baselines: at least +5% Return, +5% Sharpe ratio, +5% Sortino ratio, +2% Omega ratio (larger gains in turbulence). Ablation confirms upper-lower coordination, dynamic clustering, capital allocation are key to robustness. SHAP reveals complementary 'diversified + concentrated' mechanism.

Conclusion: SAMP-HDRL embeds structural market constraints into DRL pipeline, offering improved adaptability, robustness, and interpretability in complex financial environments.

Abstract: Portfolio optimization in non-stationary markets is challenging due to regime shifts, dynamic correlations, and the limited interpretability of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) policies. We propose a Segmented Allocation with Momentum-Adjusted Utility for Multi-agent Portfolio Management via Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (SAMP-HDRL). The framework first applies dynamic asset grouping to partition the market into high-quality and ordinary subsets. An upper-level agent extracts global market signals, while lower-level agents perform intra-group allocation under mask constraints. A utility-based capital allocation mechanism integrates risky and risk-free assets, ensuring coherent coordination between global and local decisions. backtests across three market regimes (2019--2021) demonstrate that SAMP-HDRL consistently outperforms nine traditional baselines and nine DRL benchmarks under volatile and oscillating conditions. Compared with the strongest baseline, our method achieves at least 5\% higher Return, 5\% higher Sharpe ratio, 5\% higher Sortino ratio, and 2\% higher Omega ratio, with substantially larger gains observed in turbulent markets. Ablation studies confirm that upper--lower coordination, dynamic clustering, and capital allocation are indispensable to robustness. SHAP-based interpretability further reveals a complementary ``diversified + concentrated'' mechanism across agents, providing transparent insights into decision-making. Overall, SAMP-HDRL embeds structural market constraints directly into the DRL pipeline, offering improved adaptability, robustness, and interpretability in complex financial environments.

*Yaping Zhang,Qixuan Zhang,Xingquan Zhang,Zhiyuan Chen,Wenwen Zhuang,Yupu Liang,Lu Xiang,Yang Zhao,Jiajun Zhang,Yu Zhou,Chengqing Zong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces HiSciBench, a hierarchical benchmark for evaluating foundation models' scientific intelligence across five workflow levels (Literacy to Discovery) with 8,735 instances across six disciplines and multimodal/cross-lingual support; evaluations show large performance gaps between basic and discovery tasks, setting a new standard for model assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scientific intelligence benchmarks are fragmented, focusing on narrow tasks and failing to reflect the hierarchical, multi-disciplinary nature of real scientific inquiry, so a comprehensive, integrated benchmark is needed.

Method: The authors designed HiSciBench, a hierarchical benchmark covering five levels mirroring the scientific workflow (Scientific Literacy, Literature Parsing, QA, Review Generation, Discovery) with 8,735 curated instances across six disciplines, supporting multimodal inputs and cross-lingual evaluation; it uses a dependency-aware framework for detailed capability diagnosis.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations of leading models (GPT-5, DeepSeek-R1, multimodal systems) reveal substantial performance gaps: up to 69% accuracy on basic literacy tasks, but only 25% on discovery-level challenges.

Conclusion: HiSciBench establishes a new standard for evaluating scientific intelligence, provides actionable insights for developing more capable/reliable models, and will be publicly released to facilitate future research.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal foundation models has sparked growing interest in their potential for scientific research. However, scientific intelligence encompasses a broad spectrum of abilities ranging from understanding fundamental knowledge to conducting creative discovery, and existing benchmarks remain fragmented. Most focus on narrow tasks and fail to reflect the hierarchical and multi-disciplinary nature of real scientific inquiry. We introduce \textbf{HiSciBench}, a hierarchical benchmark designed to evaluate foundation models across five levels that mirror the complete scientific workflow: \textit{Scientific Literacy} (L1), \textit{Literature Parsing} (L2), \textit{Literature-based Question Answering} (L3), \textit{Literature Review Generation} (L4), and \textit{Scientific Discovery} (L5). HiSciBench contains 8,735 carefully curated instances spanning six major scientific disciplines, including mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, geography, and astronomy, and supports multimodal inputs including text, equations, figures, and tables, as well as cross-lingual evaluation. Unlike prior benchmarks that assess isolated abilities, HiSciBench provides an integrated, dependency-aware framework that enables detailed diagnosis of model capabilities across different stages of scientific reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations of leading models, including GPT-5, DeepSeek-R1, and several multimodal systems, reveal substantial performance gaps: while models achieve up to 69\% accuracy on basic literacy tasks, performance declines sharply to 25\% on discovery-level challenges. HiSciBench establishes a new standard for evaluating scientific Intelligence and offers actionable insights for developing models that are not only more capable but also more reliable. The benchmark will be publicly released to facilitate future research.

### [222] [Geometric Structural Knowledge Graph Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22931)
*Ling Xin,Mojtaba Nayyeri,Zahra Makki Nayeri,Steffen Staab*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Gamma, a knowledge graph foundation model with multi-head geometric attention, outperforms existing approaches like Ultra in zero-shot inductive link prediction by using diverse relational transformations and adaptive fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing structural knowledge graph foundation models (e.g., Ultra) rely on a single relational transformation in message passing, limiting expressiveness and failing to capture diverse relational/structural patterns across graphs.

Method: Gamma uses multi-head geometric attention: replaces single relational transformation with parallel ones (real, complex, split-complex, dual number-based) and adaptively fuses them via link-level lightweight gating with entropy regularization.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on 56 diverse graphs show Gamma outperforms Ultra: 5.5% improvement in mean reciprocal rank (MRR) on inductive benchmarks and 4.4% improvement across all benchmarks.

Conclusion: Complementary geometric representations in Gamma enhance its ability to model diverse relational structures, leading to better zero-shot inductive reasoning performance.

Abstract: Structural knowledge graph foundation models aim to generalize reasoning to completely new graphs with unseen entities and relations. A key limitation of existing approaches like Ultra is their reliance on a single relational transformation (e.g., element-wise multiplication) in message passing, which can constrain expressiveness and fail to capture diverse relational and structural patterns exhibited on diverse graphs. In this paper, we propose Gamma, a novel foundation model that introduces multi-head geometric attention to knowledge graph reasoning. Gamma replaces the single relational transformation with multiple parallel ones, including real, complex, split-complex, and dual number based transformations, each designed to model different relational structures. A relational conditioned attention fusion mechanism then adaptively fuses them at link level via a lightweight gating with entropy regularization, allowing the model to robustly emphasize the most appropriate relational bias for each triple pattern. We present a full formalization of these algebraic message functions and discuss how their combination increases expressiveness beyond any single space. Comprehensive experiments on 56 diverse knowledge graphs demonstrate that Gamma consistently outperforms Ultra in zero-shot inductive link prediction, with a 5.5% improvement in mean reciprocal rank on the inductive benchmarks and a 4.4% improvement across all benchmarks, highlighting benefits from complementary geometric representations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces RW-Post, a dataset for real-world multimodal fact-checking with contextual info, reasoning, and evidence, plus AgentFact, an agent-based framework; their synergy boosts accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the limitations of existing multimodal fact-checking approaches (limited reasoning, shallow evidence use) and the lack of dedicated datasets with complete instances, annotated reasoning, and verifiable evidence.

Method: 1. Develop RW-Post dataset: align real-world multimodal claims with original social media posts, extract detailed reasoning and linked evidence from human fact-checks via LLM-assisted pipeline. 2. Propose AgentFact framework: 5 specialized agents (strategy planning, evidence retrieval, visual analysis, reasoning, explanation generation) orchestrated in iterative workflow alternating evidence search and task-aware filtering/reasoning.

Result: Extensive experiments show the synergy between RW-Post and AgentFact significantly improves both accuracy and interpretability of multimodal fact-checking.

Conclusion: RW-Post and AgentFact address key bottlenecks in multimodal fact-checking, enhancing performance and interpretability.

Abstract: The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation poses a growing challenge for automated fact-checking systems. Existing approaches, including large vision language models (LVLMs) and deep multimodal fusion methods, often fall short due to limited reasoning and shallow evidence utilization. A key bottleneck is the lack of dedicated datasets that provide complete real-world multimodal misinformation instances accompanied by annotated reasoning processes and verifiable evidence. To address this limitation, we introduce RW-Post, a high-quality and explainable dataset for real-world multimodal fact-checking. RW-Post aligns real-world multimodal claims with their original social media posts, preserving the rich contextual information in which the claims are made. In addition, the dataset includes detailed reasoning and explicitly linked evidence, which are derived from human written fact-checking articles via a large language model assisted extraction pipeline, enabling comprehensive verification and explanation. Building upon RW-Post, we propose AgentFact, an agent-based multimodal fact-checking framework designed to emulate the human verification workflow. AgentFact consists of five specialized agents that collaboratively handle key fact-checking subtasks, including strategy planning, high-quality evidence retrieval, visual analysis, reasoning, and explanation generation. These agents are orchestrated through an iterative workflow that alternates between evidence searching and task-aware evidence filtering and reasoning, facilitating strategic decision-making and systematic evidence analysis. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the synergy between RW-Post and AgentFact substantially improves both the accuracy and interpretability of multimodal fact-checking.

### [224] [Problems With Large Language Models for Learner Modelling: Why LLMs Alone Fall Short for Responsible Tutoring in K--12 Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23036)
*Danial Hooshyar,Yeongwook Yang,Gustav Šíř,Tommi Kärkkäinen,Raija Hämäläinen,Mutlu Cukurova,Roger Azevedo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study challenges the misconception that LLM-based tutors can replace traditional learner modeling for adaptive instruction in K-12 education (a high-risk domain per EU AI Act). It compares a deep knowledge tracing (DKT) model with a widely used LLM (zero-shot and fine-tuned) using a large dataset, finding DKT outperforms LLMs in accuracy, reliability, temporal coherence of knowledge assessment, and efficiency, suggesting responsible tutoring needs hybrid frameworks combining learner modeling with LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the misconception that generative models (LLMs) can replace traditional learner modeling for adaptive instruction in K-12 education (classified as high-risk by EU AI Act) by synthesizing evidence on LLM-based tutors' limitations and empirically investigating the accuracy, reliability, and temporal coherence of their knowledge assessment over time.

Method: Compare a deep knowledge tracing (DKT) model with a widely used LLM (evaluated zero-shot and fine-tuned) using a large open-access dataset; conduct temporal analyses of mastery updates and qualitative analysis of multi-skill mastery estimation.

Result: DKT achieves higher discrimination performance (AUC=0.83 vs. fine-tuned LLM's ~7% lower AUC than DKT, which is still 8% better than zero-shot LLM), has fewer harmful early-sequence errors, maintains stable directionally correct mastery updates, and requires far less computation (vs. ~198 hours for fine-tuned LLM). LLMs (even fine-tuned) show temporal weaknesses (inconsistent/wrong-direction updates) and inconsistent mastery trajectories.

Conclusion: LLMs alone are unlikely to match established intelligent tutoring systems' effectiveness; responsible tutoring requires hybrid frameworks incorporating learner modeling.

Abstract: The rapid rise of large language model (LLM)-based tutors in K--12 education has fostered a misconception that generative models can replace traditional learner modelling for adaptive instruction. This is especially problematic in K--12 settings, which the EU AI Act classifies as high-risk domain requiring responsible design. Motivated by these concerns, this study synthesises evidence on limitations of LLM-based tutors and empirically investigates one critical issue: the accuracy, reliability, and temporal coherence of assessing learners' evolving knowledge over time. We compare a deep knowledge tracing (DKT) model with a widely used LLM, evaluated zero-shot and fine-tuned, using a large open-access dataset. Results show that DKT achieves the highest discrimination performance (AUC = 0.83) on next-step correctness prediction and consistently outperforms the LLM across settings. Although fine-tuning improves the LLM's AUC by approximately 8\% over the zero-shot baseline, it remains 6\% below DKT and produces higher early-sequence errors, where incorrect predictions are most harmful for adaptive support. Temporal analyses further reveal that DKT maintains stable, directionally correct mastery updates, whereas LLM variants exhibit substantial temporal weaknesses, including inconsistent and wrong-direction updates. These limitations persist despite the fine-tuned LLM requiring nearly 198 hours of high-compute training, far exceeding the computational demands of DKT. Our qualitative analysis of multi-skill mastery estimation further shows that, even after fine-tuning, the LLM produced inconsistent mastery trajectories, while DKT maintained smooth and coherent updates. Overall, the findings suggest that LLMs alone are unlikely to match the effectiveness of established intelligent tutoring systems, and that responsible tutoring requires hybrid frameworks that incorporate learner modelling.

### [225] [The Reward Model Selection Crisis in Personalized Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23067)
*Fady Rezk,Yuangang Pan,Chuan-Sheng Foo,Xun Xu,Nancy Chen,Henry Gouk,Timothy Hospedales*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper challenges the assumption that better reward model (RM) accuracy in personalized alignment leads to better deployment behavior, introduces policy accuracy as a new metric, presents Pref-LaMP benchmark for direct behavioral evaluation, finds weak correlation between RM accuracy and policy-level discrimination, shows decoupling between discrimination and generation, and reveals in-context learning (ICL) outperforms reward-guided methods for large models (>3B params).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical but overlooked requirement that reward models for personalized alignment must not only rank preferences accurately but also effectively guide token-level generation decisions under deployment constraints (inference-time adaptation via reward-guided decoding instead of per-user policy fine-tuning).

Method: Systematic evaluation across three datasets, introduction of policy accuracy metric (quantifies if RGD scoring functions correctly discriminate preferred vs dispreferred responses), development of Pref-LaMP benchmark (first personalized alignment benchmark with ground-truth user completions for direct behavioral evaluation without circular reward-based metrics).

Result: RM accuracy correlates weakly with policy-level discrimination ability (Kendall's tau=0.08--0.31); methods with 20-point RM accuracy differences produce almost identical output quality; high discrimination methods fail to generate behaviorally aligned responses; ICL dominates all reward-guided methods for models >3B params (3-5 point ROUGE-1 gains over best reward method at 7B scale).

Conclusion: The field of personalized alignment optimizes proxy metrics (like RM accuracy) that fail to predict deployment performance and do not translate preferences into real behavioral adaptation under deployment constraints.

Abstract: Personalized alignment from preference data has focused primarily on improving reward model (RM) accuracy, with the implicit assumption that better preference ranking translates to better personalized behavior. However, in deployment, computational constraints necessitate inference-time adaptation via reward-guided decoding (RGD) rather than per-user policy fine-tuning. This creates a critical but overlooked requirement: reward models must not only rank preferences accurately but also effectively guide token-level generation decisions. We demonstrate that standard RM accuracy fails catastrophically as a selection criterion for deployment-ready personalized alignment. Through systematic evaluation across three datasets, we introduce policy accuracy, a metric quantifying whether RGD scoring functions correctly discriminate between preferred and dispreferred responses. We show that RM accuracy correlates only weakly with this policy-level discrimination ability (Kendall's tau = 0.08--0.31). More critically, we introduce Pref-LaMP, the first personalized alignment benchmark with ground-truth user completions, enabling direct behavioral evaluation without circular reward-based metrics. On Pref-LaMP, we expose a complete decoupling between discrimination and generation: methods with 20-point RM accuracy differences produce almost identical output quality, and even methods achieving high discrimination fail to generate behaviorally aligned responses. Finally, simple in-context learning (ICL) dominates all reward-guided methods for models > 3B parameters, achieving 3-5 point ROUGE-1 gains over the best reward method at 7B scale. These findings show that the field optimizes proxy metrics that fail to predict deployment performance and do not translate preferences into real behavioral adaptation under deployment constraints.

TL;DR: This paper explores RL for LLMs in medical imaging, introduces ChexReason trained with limited resources, finds RL improves in-distribution performance but harms cross-dataset transferability, identifies a generalization paradox, and suggests curated SFT may be better for clinical deployment requiring robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored resource-constrained application of recent RL advances for LLMs in medical imaging.

Method: Introduce ChexReason, a vision-language model trained via R1-style methodology (SFT followed by GRPO) using only 2,000 SFT samples, 1,000 RL samples, and a single A100 GPU; evaluate on CheXpert and NIH benchmarks; conduct cross-model comparisons.

Result: GRPO recovers in-distribution performance (23% improvement on CheXpert, macro-F1=0.346) but degrades cross-dataset transferability (19% drop on NIH); the SFT checkpoint uniquely improves on NIH before optimization; structured reasoning scaffolds benefit general-purpose VLMs but offer minimal gain for medically pre-trained models.

Conclusion: Curated supervised fine-tuning may outperform aggressive RL for clinical deployment requiring robustness across diverse populations, as the RL paradigm (not scale) causes the cross-dataset transferability issue.

Abstract: Recent Reinforcement Learning (RL) advances for Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved reasoning tasks, yet their resource-constrained application to medical imaging remains underexplored. We introduce ChexReason, a vision-language model trained via R1-style methodology (SFT followed by GRPO) using only 2,000 SFT samples, 1,000 RL samples, and a single A100 GPU. Evaluations on CheXpert and NIH benchmarks reveal a fundamental tension: GRPO recovers in-distribution performance (23% improvement on CheXpert, macro-F1 = 0.346) but degrades cross-dataset transferability (19% drop on NIH). This mirrors high-resource models like NV-Reason-CXR-3B, suggesting the issue stems from the RL paradigm rather than scale. We identify a generalization paradox where the SFT checkpoint uniquely improves on NIH before optimization, indicating teacher-guided reasoning captures more institution-agnostic features. Furthermore, cross-model comparisons show structured reasoning scaffolds benefit general-purpose VLMs but offer minimal gain for medically pre-trained models. Consequently, curated supervised fine-tuning may outperform aggressive RL for clinical deployment requiring robustness across diverse populations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a computationally-embedded perspective for continual learning, proposes an interactivity objective to measure adaptive prediction ability, develops an interactivity-seeking model-based RL algorithm, and finds deep linear networks sustain higher interactivity with increased capacity than deep nonlinear ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing continual learning approaches rely on explicit constraints (ad hoc, hard to incorporate, limit scaling), so the paper aims to provide a constraint-free setting via computational embedding and a new objective to evaluate continual learning capability.

Method: 1) Characterize a computationally-embedded setting where agents are automata in a universal computer (equivalent to infinite-state POMDP); 2) Propose interactivity objective measuring adaptive prediction; 3) Develop interactivity-seeking model-based RL algorithm; 4) Construct synthetic problem for evaluation.

Result: Deep nonlinear networks struggle to sustain interactivity, while deep linear networks show higher interactivity as their capacity increases.

Conclusion: The computationally-embedded perspective and interactivity objective offer a new way to study continual learning; deep linear networks outperform nonlinear ones in sustaining interactivity with increased capacity.

Abstract: Continual learning is often motivated by the idea, known as the big world hypothesis, that "the world is bigger" than the agent. Recent problem formulations capture this idea by explicitly constraining an agent relative to the environment. These constraints lead to solutions in which the agent continually adapts to best use its limited capacity, rather than converging to a fixed solution. However, explicit constraints can be ad hoc, difficult to incorporate, and may limit the effectiveness of scaling up the agent's capacity. In this paper, we characterize a problem setting in which an agent, regardless of its capacity, is constrained by being embedded in the environment. In particular, we introduce a computationally-embedded perspective that represents an embedded agent as an automaton simulated within a universal (formal) computer. Such an automaton is always constrained; we prove that it is equivalent to an agent that interacts with a partially observable Markov decision process over a countably infinite state-space. We propose an objective for this setting, which we call interactivity, that measures an agent's ability to continually adapt its behaviour by learning new predictions. We then develop a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm for interactivity-seeking, and use it to construct a synthetic problem to evaluate continual learning capability. Our results show that deep nonlinear networks struggle to sustain interactivity, whereas deep linear networks sustain higher interactivity as capacity increases.

Motivation: To address the bottleneck of manual kernel optimization unable to keep up with complex AI models (LLMs, multimodal, recommendation systems) and diverse hardware architectures.

Method: Develop AKG kernel agent, a multi-agent system supporting multiple DSLs (Triton, TileLang, CPP, CUDA-C) with modular design for easy integration of new DSLs and hardware targets.

Result: On KernelBench using Triton DSL across GPU and NPU backends, AKG kernel agent achieves an average speedup of 1.46x over PyTorch Eager baselines.

Conclusion: AKG kernel agent effectively accelerates kernel development for modern AI workloads by automating generation, migration, and tuning across different DSLs and hardware backends.

Abstract: Modern AI models demand high-performance computation kernels. The growing complexity of LLMs, multimodal architectures, and recommendation systems, combined with techniques like sparsity and quantization, creates significant computational challenges. Moreover, frequent hardware updates and diverse chip architectures further complicate this landscape, requiring tailored kernel implementations for each platform. However, manual optimization cannot keep pace with these demands, creating a critical bottleneck in AI system development. Recent advances in LLM code generation capabilities have opened new possibilities for automating kernel development. In this work, we propose AKG kernel agent (AI-driven Kernel Generator), a multi-agent system that automates kernel generation, migration, and performance tuning. AKG kernel agent is designed to support multiple domain-specific languages (DSLs), including Triton, TileLang, CPP, and CUDA-C, enabling it to target different hardware backends while maintaining correctness and portability. The system's modular design allows rapid integration of new DSLs and hardware targets. When evaluated on KernelBench using Triton DSL across GPU and NPU backends, AKG kernel agent achieves an average speedup of 1.46$\times$ over PyTorch Eager baselines implementations, demonstrating its effectiveness in accelerating kernel development for modern AI workloads.

Motivation: The initial model often struggles to generate responses satisfying all constraints in complex instruction following tasks, leading to sparse or indistinguishable rewards that impede RL learning.

Method: HiR employs a select-then-rewrite strategy to replay failed attempts as successes based on satisfied constraints; it frames the objective as dual-preference learning at instruction and response levels, using binary reward signals for efficient optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments show HiR yields promising results across different instruction following tasks while requiring less computational budget.

Conclusion: HiR is an effective sample-efficient RL framework for complex instruction following tasks, addressing sparse reward issues and improving performance with reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow instructions with various constraints. Despite the encouraging results, RL improvement inevitably relies on sampling successful, high-quality responses; however, the initial model often struggles to generate responses that satisfy all constraints due to its limited capabilities, yielding sparse or indistinguishable rewards that impede learning. In this work, we propose Hindsight instruction Replay (HiR), a novel sample-efficient RL framework for complex instruction following tasks, which employs a select-then-rewrite strategy to replay failed attempts as successes based on the constraints that have been satisfied in hindsight. We perform RL on these replayed samples as well as the original ones, theoretically framing the objective as dual-preference learning at both the instruction- and response-level to enable efficient optimization using only a binary reward signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed HiR yields promising results across different instruction following tasks, while requiring less computational budget.

### [230] [The Gaining Paths to Investment Success: Information-Driven LLM Graph Reasoning for Venture Capital Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23489)
*Haoyu Pei,Zhongyang Liu,Xiangyi Xiao,Xiaocong Du,Haipeng Zhang,Kunpeng Zhang,Suting Hong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes MIRAGE-VC, a multi-perspective retrieval-augmented generation framework for venture capital (VC) startup success prediction, addressing path explosion and heterogeneous evidence fusion issues in off-graph tasks, achieving improved F1 and PrecisionAt5 metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ML and GNNs lack reasoning capability for VC success prediction which requires synthesizing complex relational evidence; recent graph-LLM methods focus on in-graph tasks, not off-graph ones like VC prediction where the target is outside the network, and there are challenges of path explosion and heterogeneous evidence fusion.

Method: MIRAGE-VC uses an information-gain-driven path retriever to iteratively select high-value neighbors, distilling networks into compact chains for reasoning; a multi-agent architecture integrates three evidence streams via a learnable gating mechanism based on company attributes, with strict anti-leakage controls.

Result: MIRAGE-VC achieves +5.0% F1 and +16.6% PrecisionAt5 in VC startup success prediction; it also provides insights for other off-graph tasks like recommendation and risk assessment.

Conclusion: MIRAGE-VC effectively addresses the challenges of off-graph VC prediction by combining retrieval-augmented reasoning and multi-agent evidence fusion, outperforming existing methods and being applicable to other off-graph tasks.

Abstract: Most venture capital (VC) investments fail, while a few deliver outsized returns. Accurately predicting startup success requires synthesizing complex relational evidence, including company disclosures, investor track records, and investment network structures, through explicit reasoning to form coherent, interpretable investment theses. Traditional machine learning and graph neural networks both lack this reasoning capability. Large language models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning but face a modality mismatch with graphs. Recent graph-LLM methods target in-graph tasks where answers lie within the graph, whereas VC prediction is off-graph: the target exists outside the network. The core challenge is selecting graph paths that maximize predictor performance on an external objective while enabling step-by-step reasoning. We present MIRAGE-VC, a multi-perspective retrieval-augmented generation framework that addresses two obstacles: path explosion (thousands of candidate paths overwhelm LLM context) and heterogeneous evidence fusion (different startups need different analytical emphasis). Our information-gain-driven path retriever iteratively selects high-value neighbors, distilling investment networks into compact chains for explicit reasoning. A multi-agent architecture integrates three evidence streams via a learnable gating mechanism based on company attributes. Under strict anti-leakage controls, MIRAGE-VC achieves +5.0% F1 and +16.6% PrecisionAt5, and sheds light on other off-graph prediction tasks such as recommendation and risk assessment.

### [231] [Why AI Safety Requires Uncertainty, Incomplete Preferences, and Non-Archimedean Utilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23508)
*Alessio Benavoli,Alessandro Facchini,Marco Zaffalon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores aligning AI systems with human values and safety via AI assistance and shutdown games frameworks, emphasizing the need for agents that reason under uncertainty and handle incomplete/non-Archimedean preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure AI systems are aligned with human values and remain safe, focusing on AI assistance (learning human utility functions) and shutdown (compliance with shutdown buttons without prevention/causation) problems.

Method: Analysis of AI assistance and shutdown games frameworks, highlighting requirements for agents to reason under uncertainty and handle incomplete and non-Archimedean preferences.

Result: Identified that addressing AI alignment and safety challenges (assistance and shutdown) necessitates agents capable of reasoning under uncertainty and managing incomplete/non-Archimedean preferences.

Conclusion: Effective AI alignment and safety solutions require agents that can reason under uncertainty and handle incomplete and non-Archimedean preferences to address both assistance and shutdown problems.

Abstract: How can we ensure that AI systems are aligned with human values and remain safe? We can study this problem through the frameworks of the AI assistance and the AI shutdown games. The AI assistance problem concerns designing an AI agent that helps a human to maximise their utility function(s). However, only the human knows these function(s); the AI assistant must learn them. The shutdown problem instead concerns designing AI agents that: shut down when a shutdown button is pressed; neither try to prevent nor cause the pressing of the shutdown button; and otherwise accomplish their task competently. In this paper, we show that addressing these challenges requires AI agents that can reason under uncertainty and handle both incomplete and non-Archimedean preferences.

### [232] [Divergent-Convergent Thinking in Large Language Models for Creative Problem Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23601)
*Manh Hung Nguyen,Adish Singla*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes CreativeDC, a two-phase prompting method inspired by creativity theories, to address the Artificial Hivemind effect in LLM-generated educational problems, improving diversity and novelty while maintaining utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs generate homogeneous educational problems due to the Artificial Hivemind effect, harming students' diverse thinking; existing methods lack effective scaffolding for creative problem generation.

Method: CreativeDC is a two-phase prompting method decoupling creative exploration (divergent thinking) from constraint satisfaction (convergent thinking), based on Wallas's creativity theory and Guilford's divergent-convergent framework.

Result: CreativeDC outperforms baselines in diversity and novelty of generated problems while keeping high utility; scaling analysis shows it produces more distinct problems at a faster rate when sampling more.

Conclusion: CreativeDC effectively mitigates the Artificial Hivemind effect in LLM-generated educational problems, offering a promising approach to enhance creative problem generation with LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significant potential for generating educational questions and problems, enabling educators to create large-scale learning materials. However, LLMs are fundamentally limited by the ``Artificial Hivemind'' effect, where they generate similar responses within the same model and produce homogeneous outputs across different models. As a consequence, students may be exposed to overly similar and repetitive LLM-generated problems, which harms diversity of thought. Drawing inspiration from Wallas's theory of creativity and Guilford's framework of divergent-convergent thinking, we propose CreativeDC, a two-phase prompting method that explicitly scaffolds the LLM's reasoning into distinct phases. By decoupling creative exploration from constraint satisfaction, our method enables LLMs to explore a broader space of ideas before committing to a final problem. We evaluate CreativeDC for creative problem generation using a comprehensive set of metrics that capture diversity, novelty, and utility. The results show that CreativeDC achieves significantly higher diversity and novelty compared to baselines while maintaining high utility. Moreover, scaling analysis shows that CreativeDC generates a larger effective number of distinct problems as more are sampled, increasing at a faster rate than baseline methods.

### [234] [Regret-Based Federated Causal Discovery with Unknown Interventions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23626)
*Federico Baldo,Charles K. Assaad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses federated causal discovery under unknown client-level interventions by proposing I-PERI, which recovers the union CPDAG and orients edges using cross-client structural differences to form a tighter Φ-CPDAG, with theoretical convergence and privacy guarantees and empirical effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated causal discovery methods assume all clients share the same causal model, which is unrealistic due to client-specific policies/protocols inducing heterogeneous unknown interventions.

Method: I-PERI first recovers the CPDAG of the union of client graphs, then orients additional edges by exploiting structural differences from interventions across clients to form the Φ-CPDAG representing the Φ-Markov Equivalence Class.

Result: The paper provides theoretical guarantees on I-PERI's convergence and privacy-preserving properties, and empirical evaluations on synthetic data demonstrate its effectiveness.

Conclusion: I-PERI effectively handles federated causal discovery under unknown client-level interventions by leveraging cross-client structural differences to form a tighter equivalence class, with solid theoretical and empirical support.

Abstract: Most causal discovery methods recover a completed partially directed acyclic graph representing a Markov equivalence class from observational data. Recent work has extended these methods to federated settings to address data decentralization and privacy constraints, but often under idealized assumptions that all clients share the same causal model. Such assumptions are unrealistic in practice, as client-specific policies or protocols, for example, across hospitals, naturally induce heterogeneous and unknown interventions. In this work, we address federated causal discovery under unknown client-level interventions. We propose I-PERI, a novel federated algorithm that first recovers the CPDAG of the union of client graphs and then orients additional edges by exploiting structural differences induced by interventions across clients. This yields a tighter equivalence class, which we call the $\mathbfΦ$-Markov Equivalence Class, represented by the $\mathbfΦ$-CPDAG. We provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence of I-PERI, as well as on its privacy-preserving properties, and present empirical evaluations on synthetic data demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

### [235] [Web World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23676)
*Jichen Feng,Yifan Zhang,Chenggong Zhang,Yifu Lu,Shilong Liu,Mengdi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Web World Model (WWM), a middle ground between fixed web frameworks and fully generative world models, using web code for logical consistency and LLMs for context/narratives; it builds multiple WWMs and identifies design principles, showing web stacks as scalable substrates for controllable open-ended environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language agents need persistent worlds, but existing approaches are either fixed (conventional web frameworks) or lack controllability (fully generative models); thus, a middle ground is needed to balance reliability, controllability, and open-endedness.

Method: The method involves creating WWMs where world state and physics are implemented in ordinary web code for logical consistency, while large language models generate context, narratives, and high-level decisions on top of this structured latent state; design principles include separating code rules from model imagination, using typed web interfaces for latent state, and deterministic generation for structured exploration.

Result: The paper builds a suite of WWMs on a realistic web stack (infinite travel atlas, fictional galaxy explorers, web-scale encyclopedic/narrative worlds, simulation/game-like environments) and validates that web stacks can serve as scalable substrates for world models enabling controllable yet open-ended environments.

Conclusion: Web World Models (WWMs) effectively balance the trade-offs between fixed web frameworks and fully generative models, providing controllable yet open-ended environments for language agents; web stacks are scalable substrates for such models.

Abstract: Language agents increasingly require persistent worlds in which they can act, remember, and learn. Existing approaches sit at two extremes: conventional web frameworks provide reliable but fixed contexts backed by databases, while fully generative world models aim for unlimited environments at the expense of controllability and practical engineering. In this work, we introduce the Web World Model (WWM), a middle ground where world state and ``physics'' are implemented in ordinary web code to ensure logical consistency, while large language models generate context, narratives, and high-level decisions on top of this structured latent state. We build a suite of WWMs on a realistic web stack, including an infinite travel atlas grounded in real geography, fictional galaxy explorers, web-scale encyclopedic and narrative worlds, and simulation- and game-like environments. Across these systems, we identify practical design principles for WWMs: separating code-defined rules from model-driven imagination, representing latent state as typed web interfaces, and utilizing deterministic generation to achieve unlimited but structured exploration. Our results suggest that web stacks themselves can serve as a scalable substrate for world models, enabling controllable yet open-ended environments.
