Data-free CL seeks to update models without\naccess to previous data. Beyond regularization, we employ model inversion to\nsynthesize data from the trained model, enabling replay without storing\nsamples. Yet, model inversion in predictive models faces two challenges: (1)\ngenerating inputs solely from compressed output labels causes drift between\nsynthetic and real data, and replaying such data can erode prior knowledge; (2)\ninversion is computationally expensive since each step backpropagates through\nthe full model.

PCGs introduce substantial additional difficulty\nover linear congruential generators (LCGs) by applying a series of bit-wise\nshifts, XORs, rotations and truncations to the hidden state. We show that\nTransformers can nevertheless successfully perform in-context prediction on\nunseen sequences from diverse PCG variants, in tasks that are beyond published\nclassical attacks. In our experiments we scale moduli up to $2^{22}$ using up\nto $50$ million model parameters and datasets with up to $5$ billion tokens.\nSurprisingly, we find even when the output is truncated to a single bit, it can\nbe reliably predicted by the model. When multiple distinct PRNGs are presented\ntogether during training, the model can jointly learn them, identifying\nstructures from different permutations. We demonstrate a scaling law with\nmodulus $m$: the number of in-context sequence elements required for\nnear-perfect prediction grows as $\\sqrt{m}$. For larger moduli, optimization\nenters extended stagnation phases; in our experiments, learning moduli $m \\geq\n2^{20}$ requires incorporating training data from smaller moduli, demonstrating\na critical necessity for curriculum learning. Finally, we analyze embedding\nlayers and uncover a novel clustering phenomenon: the model spontaneously\ngroups the integer inputs into bitwise rotationally-invariant clusters,\nrevealing how representations can transfer from smaller to larger moduli.", "AI": {"tldr": "Transformers can learn to predict sequences from Permuted Congruential Generators (PCGs), a complex class of PRNGs, even with single-bit outputs and large moduli up to 2^22, showing scaling laws and requiring curriculum learning for larger moduli.", "motivation": "To investigate Transformer models' capability to learn complex pseudo-random number generator sequences, specifically PCGs which add significant difficulty over simpler LCGs through bit-wise operations, and understand their scaling behavior and learning mechanisms.", "method": "Train Transformer models on sequences generated by diverse PCG variants, scaling up to 50M parameters and 5B tokens, testing prediction on unseen sequences, analyzing scaling laws, and examining embedding representations through clustering analysis.", "result": "Transformers successfully predict PCG sequences beyond classical attacks, even with single-bit outputs, learn multiple PRNGs jointly, follow sqrt(m) scaling law for required context length, require curriculum learning for large moduli (\u22652^20), and exhibit spontaneous clustering of integer inputs into bitwise rotationally-invariant groups.", "conclusion": "Transformers demonstrate remarkable capability to learn complex PRNG patterns, revealing fundamental scaling properties and novel representation learning phenomena that enable knowledge transfer across different modulus sizes, with implications for understanding neural network generalization and cryptographic analysis."}}
