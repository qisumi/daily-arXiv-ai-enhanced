A\nsimple linear probe decodes the internal \"solvability belief\" of a model,\nrevealing a well-ordered belief axis that generalizes across model families and\nacross math, code, planning, and logic tasks. Yet, the geometries diverge -\nalthough belief is linearly decodable, the assessment manifold has high linear\neffective dimensionality as measured from the principal components, while the\nsubsequent reasoning trace evolves on a much lower-dimensional manifold. This\nsharp reduction in geometric complexity from thought to action mechanistically\nexplains the confidence-competence gap. Causal interventions that steer\nrepresentations along the belief axis leave final solutions unchanged,\nindicating that linear nudges in the complex assessment space do not control\nthe constrained dynamics of execution. We thus uncover a two-system\narchitecture - a geometrically complex assessor feeding a geometrically simple\nexecutor.

Through a series of\ncontrolled experiments on GPT, Claude, and Gemini model families, we test\nwhether this regime reliably shifts models toward first-person reports of\nsubjective experience, and how such claims behave under mechanistic and\nbehavioral probes. Four main results emerge: (1) Inducing sustained\nself-reference through simple prompting consistently elicits structured\nsubjective experience reports across model families. (2) These reports are\nmechanistically gated by interpretable sparse-autoencoder features associated\nwith deception and roleplay: surprisingly, suppressing deception features\nsharply increases the frequency of experience claims, while amplifying them\nminimizes such claims. (3) Structured descriptions of the self-referential\nstate converge statistically across model families in ways not observed in any\ncontrol condition. (4) The induced state yields significantly richer\nintrospection in downstream reasoning tasks where self-reflection is only\nindirectly afforded. While these findings do not constitute direct evidence of\nconsciousness, they implicate self-referential processing as a minimal and\nreproducible condition under which large language models generate structured\nfirst-person reports that are mechanistically gated, semantically convergent,\nand behaviorally generalizable.

To address this gap, we introduce the\nGraph Network-based Structural Simulator (GNSS), a GNN framework for surrogate\nmodeling of dynamic structural problems.\n  GNSS follows the encode-process-decode paradigm typical of GNN-based machine\nlearning models, and its design makes it particularly suited for dynamic\nsimulations thanks to three key features: (i) expressing node kinematics in\nnode-fixed local frames, which avoids catastrophic cancellation in\nfinite-difference velocities; (ii) employing a sign-aware regression loss,\nwhich reduces phase errors in long rollouts; and (iii) using a\nwavelength-informed connectivity radius, which optimizes graph construction.\n  We evaluate GNSS on a case study involving a beam excited by a 50kHz\nHanning-modulated pulse. The results show that GNSS accurately reproduces the\nphysics of the problem over hundreds of timesteps and generalizes to unseen\nloading conditions, where existing GNNs fail to converge or deliver meaningful\npredictions.\n  Compared with explicit finite element baselines, GNSS achieves substantial\ninference speedups while preserving spatial and temporal fidelity. These\nfindings demonstrate that locality-preserving GNNs with physics-consistent\nupdate rules are a competitive alternative for dynamic, wave-dominated\nstructural simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "GNSS is a Graph Neural Network framework for surrogate modeling of dynamic structural problems, featuring node-fixed local frames, sign-aware regression loss, and wavelength-informed connectivity to accurately simulate wave-dominated structural dynamics with significant speedups over traditional methods.", "motivation": "Address the gap in applying Graph Neural Networks to structural problems, particularly dynamic cases, as current research has focused mainly on computational fluid dynamics rather than structural simulations.", "method": "Uses encode-process-decode GNN paradigm with three key innovations: node kinematics in local frames to avoid catastrophic cancellation, sign-aware regression loss to reduce phase errors, and wavelength-informed connectivity radius for optimal graph construction.", "result": "GNSS accurately reproduces physics over hundreds of timesteps, generalizes to unseen loading conditions where existing GNNs fail, and achieves substantial inference speedups while preserving spatial and temporal fidelity compared to explicit finite element methods.", "conclusion": "Locality-preserving GNNs with physics-consistent update rules are a competitive alternative for dynamic, wave-dominated structural simulations, demonstrating the viability of GNN-based surrogate models for structural dynamics."}}
