Recently,\ntransformer-based models leveraging the attention mechanism have demonstrated\nstrong empirical success in capturing complex dependencies within graphs.\nHowever, the theoretical understanding of their training dynamics has been\nlimited to tree-like graphs, where each node depends on a single parent.\nExtending provable guarantees to more general directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) --\nwhich involve multiple parents per node -- remains challenging, primarily due\nto the difficulty in designing training objectives that enable different\nattention heads to separately learn multiple different parent relationships.\n  In this work, we address this problem by introducing a novel\ninformation-theoretic metric: the kernel-guided mutual information (KG-MI),\nbased on the $f$-divergence. Our objective combines KG-MI with a multi-head\nattention framework, where each head is associated with a distinct marginal\ntransition kernel to model diverse parent-child dependencies effectively. We\nprove that, given sequences generated by a $K$-parent DAG, training a\nsingle-layer, multi-head transformer via gradient ascent converges to the\nglobal optimum in polynomial time. Furthermore, we characterize the attention\nscore patterns at convergence. In addition, when particularizing the\n$f$-divergence to the KL divergence, the learned attention scores accurately\nreflect the ground-truth adjacency matrix, thereby provably recovering the\nunderlying graph structure. Experimental results validate our theoretical\nfindings.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces a novel information-theoretic metric called kernel-guided mutual information (KG-MI) to enable transformers to provably learn directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with multiple parents per node, overcoming previous limitations that restricted theoretical guarantees to tree-like graphs.", "motivation": "Current transformer-based models have strong empirical success in capturing graph dependencies but theoretical understanding is limited to tree-like graphs where each node has only one parent.
