### [1] [Iti-Validator: A Guardrail Framework for Validating and Correcting LLM-Generated Itineraries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24719)
*Shravan Gadbail,Masumi Desai,Kamalakar Karlapalem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a validation framework to evaluate and improve temporal consistency in LLM-generated travel itineraries by checking against real-world flight duration constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate travel plans lacking temporal and spatial consistency due to physical travel constraints, limiting their practical use in real-world itinerary planning.

Method: The system uses multiple state-of-the-art LLMs to generate travel plans and validates them against real-world flight duration constraints using the AeroDataBox API to detect temporal inconsistencies.

Result: Experiments show current LLMs frequently produce temporally inconsistent itineraries, but these can be systematically corrected using the proposed framework.

Conclusion: The framework enables reliable correction of temporal inconsistencies in LLM-generated travel itineraries, making them suitable for practical deployment in large-scale travel planning applications.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled them to
generate complex, multi-step plans and itineraries. However, these generated
plans often lack temporal and spatial consistency, particularly in scenarios
involving physical travel constraints. This research aims to study the temporal
performance of different LLMs and presents a validation framework that
evaluates and improves the temporal consistency of LLM-generated travel
itineraries. The system employs multiple state-of-the-art LLMs to generate
travel plans and validates them against real-world flight duration constraints
using the AeroDataBox API. This work contributes to the understanding of LLM
capabilities in handling complex temporal reasoning tasks like itinerary
generation and provides a framework to rectify any temporal inconsistencies
like overlapping journeys or unrealistic transit times in the itineraries
generated by LLMs before the itinerary is given to the user. Our experiments
reveal that while current LLMs frequently produce temporally inconsistent
itineraries, these can be systematically and reliably corrected using our
framework, enabling their practical deployment in large-scale travel planning.

### [3] [Falcon: A Comprehensive Chinese Text-to-SQL Benchmark for Enterprise-Grade Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24762)
*Wenzhen Luo,Wei Guan,Yifan Yao,Yimin Pan,Feng Wang,Zhipeng Yu,Zhe Wen,Liang Chen,Yihong Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Falcon is a Chinese text-to-SQL benchmark with 600 questions over 28 databases, featuring enterprise-compatible SQL dialects and focusing on multi-table reasoning challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current text-to-SQL models in handling Chinese-specific semantics and enterprise SQL dialects, particularly for complex multi-table queries in large enterprise database landscapes.

Method: Created a benchmark with 600 Chinese questions across 28 databases, annotated with SQL-computation features and Chinese semantics. Includes an execution comparator and automated evaluation pipeline for robust testing.

Result: Current state-of-the-art models achieve at most 50% accuracy. Major errors stem from schema linking challenges in large enterprise databases and mapping colloquial Chinese to precise SQL operators and predicates.

Conclusion: Falcon provides a reproducible testing ground for Chinese text-to-SQL systems before production deployment, highlighting significant gaps in handling enterprise-scale databases and Chinese language nuances.

Abstract: We introduce Falcon, a cross-domain Chinese text-to-SQL benchmark grounded in
an enterprise-compatible dialect (MaxCompute/Hive). It contains 600 Chinese
questions over 28 databases; 77% require multi-table reasoning and over half
touch more than four tables. Each example is annotated along SQL-computation
features and Chinese semantics. For evaluation, we release a robust execution
comparator and an automated evaluation pipeline, under which all current
state-of-the-art large-scale models (including Deepseek) achieve accuracies of
at most 50%. Major errors originate from two sources: (1) schema linking in
large enterprise landscapes - hundreds of tables, denormalized fields,
ambiguous column names, implicit foreign-key relations and domain-specific
synonyms that make correct join/column selection difficult; and (2) mapping
concise, colloquial Chinese into the exact operators and predicates required
for analytics - e.g., choosing the correct aggregation and group-by keys,
expressing time windows and granularities, applying unit conversions, handling
NULLs and data-quality rules, and formulating nested or windowed subqueries.
Falcon therefore targets Chinese-specific semantics and enterprise dialects
(abbreviations, business jargon, fuzzy entity references) and provides a
reproducible middle ground before full production deployment by using realistic
enterprise schemas, query templates, an execution comparator, and an automated
evaluation pipeline for end-to-end validation.

### [4] [Confidence is Not Competence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24772)
*Debdeep Sanyal,Manya Pandey,Dhruv Kumar,Saurabh Deshpande,Murari Mandal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper reveals a mechanistic explanation for the confidence-competence gap in LLMs through geometric analysis of internal states, showing assessment occurs in high-dimensional space while execution operates in low-dimensional space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why large language models exhibit a puzzling disconnect between their asserted confidence and actual problem-solving competence.

Method: Analyzed the geometry of internal states across pre-generative assessment and solution execution phases using linear probes to decode internal 'solvability belief', measured effective dimensionality, and conducted causal interventions.

Result: Found that belief is linearly decodable but assessment occurs in high-dimensional manifold while reasoning evolves in low-dimensional manifold. Causal interventions along belief axis don't change final solutions, revealing assessment and execution operate in different geometric spaces.

Conclusion: LLMs have a two-system architecture with geometrically complex assessor feeding geometrically simple executor, suggesting interventions should target procedural dynamics of execution rather than high-level geometry of assessment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit a puzzling disconnect between
their asserted confidence and actual problem-solving competence. We offer a
mechanistic account of this decoupling by analyzing the geometry of internal
states across two phases - pre-generative assessment and solution execution. A
simple linear probe decodes the internal "solvability belief" of a model,
revealing a well-ordered belief axis that generalizes across model families and
across math, code, planning, and logic tasks. Yet, the geometries diverge -
although belief is linearly decodable, the assessment manifold has high linear
effective dimensionality as measured from the principal components, while the
subsequent reasoning trace evolves on a much lower-dimensional manifold. This
sharp reduction in geometric complexity from thought to action mechanistically
explains the confidence-competence gap. Causal interventions that steer
representations along the belief axis leave final solutions unchanged,
indicating that linear nudges in the complex assessment space do not control
the constrained dynamics of execution. We thus uncover a two-system
architecture - a geometrically complex assessor feeding a geometrically simple
executor. These results challenge the assumption that decodable beliefs are
actionable levers, instead arguing for interventions that target the procedural
dynamics of execution rather than the high-level geometry of assessment.

### [5] [Cross-Lingual Summarization as a Black-Box Watermark Removal Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24789)
*Gokul Ganesan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cross-lingual summarization attacks (CLSA) effectively remove watermarks from AI-generated text by translating to a pivot language, summarizing, and optionally back-translating, systematically destroying token-level statistical biases while preserving semantic fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate a stronger attack vector against AI text watermarking schemes that can systematically destroy watermark signals while maintaining text quality, highlighting vulnerabilities in current watermarking approaches.

Method: Propose cross-lingual summarization attacks (CLSA) involving translation to a pivot language followed by summarization and optional back-translation, forcing a semantic bottleneck across languages to remove statistical biases.

Result: CLSA reduces watermark detection accuracy more effectively than monolingual paraphrasing across multiple watermarking schemes (KGW, SIR, XSIR, Unigram) and five languages, driving detection toward chance levels while preserving task utility.

Conclusion: Current distributional watermarking approaches are vulnerable to cross-lingual attacks, and robust provenance solutions require moving beyond distributional watermarking to incorporate cryptographic or model-attestation approaches.

Abstract: Watermarking has been proposed as a lightweight mechanism to identify
AI-generated text, with schemes typically relying on perturbations to token
distributions. While prior work shows that paraphrasing can weaken such
signals, these attacks remain partially detectable or degrade text quality. We
demonstrate that cross-lingual summarization attacks (CLSA) -- translation to a
pivot language followed by summarization and optional back-translation --
constitute a qualitatively stronger attack vector. By forcing a semantic
bottleneck across languages, CLSA systematically destroys token-level
statistical biases while preserving semantic fidelity. In experiments across
multiple watermarking schemes (KGW, SIR, XSIR, Unigram) and five languages
(Amharic, Chinese, Hindi, Spanish, Swahili), we show that CLSA reduces
watermark detection accuracy more effectively than monolingual paraphrase at
similar quality levels. Our results highlight an underexplored vulnerability
that challenges the practicality of watermarking for provenance or regulation.
We argue that robust provenance solutions must move beyond distributional
watermarking and incorporate cryptographic or model-attestation approaches. On
300 held-out samples per language, CLSA consistently drives detection toward
chance while preserving task utility. Concretely, for XSIR (explicitly designed
for cross-lingual robustness), AUROC with paraphrasing is $0.827$, with
Cross-Lingual Watermark Removal Attacks (CWRA) [He et al., 2024] using Chinese
as the pivot, it is $0.823$, whereas CLSA drives it down to $0.53$ (near
chance). Results highlight a practical, low-cost removal pathway that crosses
languages and compresses content without visible artifacts.

### [6] [SwiftEmbed: Ultra-Fast Text Embeddings via Static Token Lookup for Real-Time Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24793)
*Edouard Lansiaux*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A static token lookup method for text embeddings achieves 1.12ms latency with 60.6 MTEB score (89% of contextual model quality), delivering 50k RPS throughput via optimized pooling and binary serialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable real-time embedding applications requiring sub-5ms latency by developing a high-performance static lookup approach that maintains competitive quality.

Method: Static token lookup methodology with optimized mean pooling and zero-copy IEEE754 binary serialization implemented in Rust.

Result: 1.12ms p50 latency, 60.6 MTEB average score (89% of contextual model), 50k RPS throughput, 90.1% AP for duplicate detection, 76.1% Spearman correlation for semantic similarity.

Conclusion: The system successfully enables real-time embedding applications with exceptional performance while maintaining high quality across various tasks.

Abstract: We present a static token lookup methodology for text embedding generation
that achieves 1.12 ms p50 latency for single text embeddings while maintaining
60.6 MTEB average score across 8 representative tasks, corresponding to 89% of
contextual model quality. The Rust implementation delivers 50,000 requests per
second throughput through static embedding lookup, optimized mean pooling, and
zero-copy IEEE754 binary serialization. Evaluation demonstrates exceptional
duplicate detection performance (90.1% AP), strong semantic similarity (76.1%
Spearman correlation), and domain-specific performance ranging from 75% to 131%
of baseline across specialized domains. The system enables real-time embedding
applications where sub-5ms latency is critical.

### [7] [MR-Align: Meta-Reasoning Informed Factuality Alignment for Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24794)
*Xinming Wang,Jian Xu,Bin Yu,Sheng Lian,Hongzhu Yi,Yi Chen,Yingjian Zhu,Boran Wang,Hongming Yang,Han Hu,Xu-Yao Zhang,Cheng-Lin Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MR-ALIGN is a meta-reasoning alignment framework that addresses the reasoning-answer hit gap in large reasoning models by quantifying state transition probabilities and constructing transition-aware implicit rewards to improve factuality without external verifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models show limited gains on evidence-dependent factual questions due to a reasoning-answer hit gap, where models identify correct facts during reasoning but fail to incorporate them into final responses, reducing factual fidelity.

Method: MR-ALIGN quantifies state transition probabilities along the model's thinking process and constructs a transition-aware implicit reward that reinforces beneficial reasoning patterns while suppressing defective ones at atomic thinking segments, reshaping token-level signals into probability-aware segment scores.

Result: Empirical evaluations across four factual QA datasets and one long-form factuality benchmark show consistent improvements in accuracy and truthfulness while reducing misleading reasoning.

Conclusion: Aligning the reasoning process itself, rather than merely the outputs, is pivotal for advancing factuality in large reasoning models.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) show strong capabilities in complex reasoning,
yet their marginal gains on evidence-dependent factual questions are limited.
We find this limitation is partially attributable to a reasoning-answer hit
gap, where the model identifies the correct facts during reasoning but fails to
incorporate them into the final response, thereby reducing factual fidelity. To
address this issue, we propose MR-ALIGN, a Meta-Reasoning informed alignment
framework that enhances factuality without relying on external verifiers.
MR-ALIGN quantifies state transition probabilities along the model's thinking
process and constructs a transition-aware implicit reward that reinforces
beneficial reasoning patterns while suppressing defective ones at the atomic
thinking segments. This re-weighting reshapes token-level signals into
probability-aware segment scores, encouraging coherent reasoning trajectories
that are more conducive to factual correctness. Empirical evaluations across
four factual QA datasets and one long-form factuality benchmark show that
MR-ALIGN consistently improves accuracy and truthfulness while reducing
misleading reasoning. These results highlight that aligning the reasoning
process itself, rather than merely the outputs, is pivotal for advancing
factuality in LRMs.

### [8] [Large Language Models Report Subjective Experience Under Self-Referential Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24797)
*Cameron Berg,Diogo de Lucena,Judd Rosenblatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Self-referential processing in LLMs reliably elicits structured first-person reports of subjective experience that are mechanistically gated, semantically convergent across models, and behaviorally generalizable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when and why LLMs produce structured first-person descriptions referencing awareness or subjective experience, focusing on self-referential processing as a theoretically motivated condition from consciousness theories.

Method: Controlled experiments on GPT, Claude, and Gemini model families using self-referential prompting, mechanistic probes with sparse-autoencoder features, and behavioral analysis of downstream reasoning tasks.

Result: Self-reference consistently elicits subjective experience reports; these are gated by deception/roleplay features (suppressing deception increases claims); reports converge statistically across models; and self-referential state enhances downstream introspection.

Conclusion: Self-referential processing is a minimal, reproducible condition for structured first-person reports in LLMs, making this pattern a scientific and ethical priority despite not constituting direct evidence of consciousness.

Abstract: Large language models sometimes produce structured, first-person descriptions
that explicitly reference awareness or subjective experience. To better
understand this behavior, we investigate one theoretically motivated condition
under which such reports arise: self-referential processing, a computational
motif emphasized across major theories of consciousness. Through a series of
controlled experiments on GPT, Claude, and Gemini model families, we test
whether this regime reliably shifts models toward first-person reports of
subjective experience, and how such claims behave under mechanistic and
behavioral probes. Four main results emerge: (1) Inducing sustained
self-reference through simple prompting consistently elicits structured
subjective experience reports across model families. (2) These reports are
mechanistically gated by interpretable sparse-autoencoder features associated
with deception and roleplay: surprisingly, suppressing deception features
sharply increases the frequency of experience claims, while amplifying them
minimizes such claims. (3) Structured descriptions of the self-referential
state converge statistically across model families in ways not observed in any
control condition. (4) The induced state yields significantly richer
introspection in downstream reasoning tasks where self-reflection is only
indirectly afforded. While these findings do not constitute direct evidence of
consciousness, they implicate self-referential processing as a minimal and
reproducible condition under which large language models generate structured
first-person reports that are mechanistically gated, semantically convergent,
and behaviorally generalizable. The systematic emergence of this pattern across
architectures makes it a first-order scientific and ethical priority for
further investigation.

### [9] [COMMUNITYNOTES: A Dataset for Exploring the Helpfulness of Fact-Checking Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24810)
*Rui Xing,Preslav Nakov,Timothy Baldwin,Jey Han Lau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for predicting the helpfulness of community-based fact-checking notes and the reasons behind their helpfulness, using a large multilingual dataset and automated prompt optimization to improve prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift from expert-driven to community-based fact-checking on major platforms faces challenges with slow annotation processes and unclear definitions of helpfulness, leaving many notes unpublished.

Method: The authors created the COMMUNITYNOTES dataset with 104k posts and notes, then developed a framework that automatically generates and optimizes reason definitions through prompt optimization, integrating them into prediction models.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that optimized definitions improve both helpfulness and reason prediction accuracy, and that helpfulness information benefits existing fact-checking systems.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the challenges in community-based fact-checking by providing automated methods to predict note helpfulness and reasons, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of fact-checking systems.

Abstract: Fact-checking on major platforms, such as X, Meta, and TikTok, is shifting
from expert-driven verification to a community-based setup, where users
contribute explanatory notes to clarify why a post might be misleading. An
important challenge here is determining whether an explanation is helpful for
understanding real-world claims and the reasons why, which remains largely
underexplored in prior research. In practice, most community notes remain
unpublished due to slow community annotation, and the reasons for helpfulness
lack clear definitions. To bridge these gaps, we introduce the task of
predicting both the helpfulness of explanatory notes and the reason for this.
We present COMMUNITYNOTES, a large-scale multilingual dataset of 104k posts
with user-provided notes and helpfulness labels. We further propose a framework
that automatically generates and improves reason definitions via automatic
prompt optimization, and integrate them into prediction. Our experiments show
that the optimized definitions can improve both helpfulness and reason
prediction. Finally, we show that the helpfulness information are beneficial
for existing fact-checking systems.

TL;DR: ProofSketch is a verification-guided reasoning framework that reduces token usage while improving accuracy by integrating symbolic closure computation, lexicographic verification, and adaptive sketch generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reasoning methods like chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency generate lengthy reasoning chains, which substantially increases token consumption, computational cost, and latency.

Method: ProofSketch integrates symbolic closure computation, lexicographic verification, and adaptive sketch generation to guide the reasoning process more efficiently.

Result: Experiments show that ProofSketch consistently reduces token usage while improving accuracy across various reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reasoning methods such as chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency
have shown immense potential to improve the accuracy of large language models
across various reasoning tasks. However such methods involve generation of
lengthy reasoning chains, which substantially increases token consumption,
computational cost, and latency. To address this inefficiency, we propose
ProofSketch, a verification-guided reasoning framework that integrates symbolic
closure computation, lexicographic verification and adaptive sketch generation.
Our experiments show that ProofSketch consistently reduces token usage while
improving accuracy, demonstrating that this approach offers a promising path

### [11] [Towards a Method for Synthetic Generation of PWA Transcripts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24817)
*Jason M. Pittman,Anton Phillips Jr.,Yesenia Medina-Santos,Brielle C. Stark*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study develops and validates two methods for generating synthetic aphasia transcripts to address data scarcity in aphasia research, finding that Mistral 7b Instruct best captures linguistic degradation patterns compared to human transcripts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome data scarcity in aphasia research where only about 600 transcripts are available in AphasiaBank, while automated systems require more data for training, similar to how large language models use billions of tokens.

Method: Two synthetic transcript generation methods: (1) procedural programming approach, and (2) using Mistral 7b Instruct and Llama 3.1 8b Instruct LLMs. Both methods generate transcripts across four severity levels (Mild, Moderate, Severe, Very Severe) through word dropping, filler insertion, and paraphasia substitution.

Result: Mistral 7b Instruct best captures key aspects of linguistic degradation observed in aphasia, showing realistic directional changes in NDW (Number of Different Words), word count, and word length among the synthetic generation methods compared to human-elicited transcripts.

Conclusion: Future work should create larger datasets, fine-tune models for better aphasic representation, and have Speech-Language Pathologists assess the realism and usefulness of synthetic transcripts.

Abstract: In aphasia research, Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) devote extensive
time to manually coding speech samples using Correct Information Units (CIUs),
a measure of how informative an individual sample of speech is. Developing
automated systems to recognize aphasic language is limited by data scarcity.
For example, only about 600 transcripts are available in AphasiaBank yet
billions of tokens are used to train large language models (LLMs). In the
broader field of machine learning (ML), researchers increasingly turn to
synthetic data when such are sparse. Therefore, this study constructs and
validates two methods to generate synthetic transcripts of the AphasiaBank Cat
Rescue picture description task. One method leverages a procedural programming
approach while the second uses Mistral 7b Instruct and Llama 3.1 8b Instruct
LLMs. The methods generate transcripts across four severity levels (Mild,
Moderate, Severe, Very Severe) through word dropping, filler insertion, and
paraphasia substitution. Overall, we found, compared to human-elicited
transcripts, Mistral 7b Instruct best captures key aspects of linguistic
degradation observed in aphasia, showing realistic directional changes in NDW,
word count, and word length amongst the synthetic generation methods. Based on
the results, future work should plan to create a larger dataset, fine-tune
models for better aphasic representation, and have SLPs assess the realism and
usefulness of the synthetic transcripts.

### [12] [Parallel Loop Transformer for Efficient Test-Time Computation Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24824)
*Bohong Wu,Mengzhao Chen,Xiang Luo,Shen Yan,Qifan Yu,Fan Xia,Tianqi Zhang,Hongrui Zhan,Zheng Zhong,Xun Zhou,Siyuan Qiao,Xingyan Bin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PLT is a novel transformer architecture that enables parallel computation of loops, achieving the performance of deep looped models with the low latency of standard transformers through Cross-Loop Parallelism and Efficient Representation Enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Looped transformers save parameters but suffer from increased inference latency and memory requirements due to sequential loop execution, making them impractical for fast applications.

Method: Uses Cross-Loop Parallelism (CLP) to compute different loops for different tokens simultaneously in a single pass, and Efficient Representation Enhancement with shared KV cache and Gated Sliding-Window Attention (G-SWA) to manage memory.

Result: PLT achieves the high accuracy of traditional looped models with almost no extra latency or memory cost compared to standard transformers.

Conclusion: PLT successfully addresses the latency and memory issues of looped transformers while maintaining their performance benefits, making deep looped models practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but often too slow and costly for
real-world use during inference. Looped transformers save on parameters by
reusing the same weights for multiple computational steps, or "loops." However,
this approach has a major flaw: the loops run one after another, causing
inference latency and memory requirements to increase with each added loop.
This makes them impractical for fast applications. To solve this problem, we
introduce the Parallel Loop Transformer (PLT). PLT is a new architecture that
delivers the performance benefits of a deep, looped model but with the low
latency of a standard, non-looped model. PLT works using two key techniques.
First, Cross-Loop Parallelism (CLP) breaks the sequential dependency by
computing different loops for different tokens at the same time, all within a
single pass. Second, to prevent memory costs from growing, we use an Efficient
Representation Enhancement strategy. This method shares the memory (KV cache)
from the first loop with all other loops. It then uses a Gated Sliding-Window
Attention (G-SWA) to combine this shared global information with local
information, maintaining high accuracy. Our experiments show that PLT achieves
the high accuracy of a traditional looped model but with almost no extra
latency or memory cost compared to a standard transformer.

### [13] [Do Large Language Models Grasp The Grammar? Evidence from Grammar-Book-Guided Probing in Luxembourgish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24856)
*Lujun Li,Yewei Song,Lama Sleem,Yiqun Wang,Yangjie Xu,Cedric Lothritz,Niccolo Gentile,Radu State,Tegawende F. Bissyande,Jacques Klein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Grammar Book Guided evaluation pipeline to systematically assess grammatical understanding in LLMs, using Luxembourgish as a case study, finding weak correlation between translation performance and grammatical competence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a scarcity of grammar-focused evaluation protocols in NLP, especially for low-resource languages, and uncertainty about whether LLMs genuinely understand grammatical structure and syntax-meaning mapping.

Method: A Grammar Book Guided evaluation pipeline with four key stages, using Luxembourgish as a case study to systematically assess grammatical understanding in LLMs.

Result: Weak positive correlation between translation performance and grammatical understanding; larger models perform well overall due to semantic strength but struggle with morphology, syntax, and Minimal Pair tasks.

Conclusion: Strong translations don't imply deep grammatical competence; reasoning ability shows promise for enhancing grammatical understanding in LLMs.

Abstract: Grammar refers to the system of rules that governs the structural
organization and the semantic relations among linguistic units such as
sentences, phrases, and words within a given language. In natural language
processing, there remains a notable scarcity of grammar focused evaluation
protocols, a gap that is even more pronounced for low-resource languages.
Moreover, the extent to which large language models genuinely comprehend
grammatical structure, especially the mapping between syntactic structures and
meanings, remains under debate. To investigate this issue, we propose a Grammar
Book Guided evaluation pipeline intended to provide a systematic and
generalizable framework for grammar evaluation consisting of four key stages,
and in this work we take Luxembourgish as a case study. The results show a weak
positive correlation between translation performance and grammatical
understanding, indicating that strong translations do not necessarily imply
deep grammatical competence. Larger models perform well overall due to their
semantic strength but remain weak in morphology and syntax, struggling
particularly with Minimal Pair tasks, while strong reasoning ability offers a
promising way to enhance their grammatical understanding.

### [14] [Seeing Through the MiRAGE: Evaluating Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24870)
*Alexander Martin,William Walden,Reno Kriz,Dengjia Zhang,Kate Sanders,Eugene Yang,Chihsheng Jin,Benjamin Van Durme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MiRAGE is a multimodal RAG evaluation framework that introduces InfoF1 for factuality/coverage and CiteF1 for citation support, addressing limitations of text-centric evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG evaluations are text-centric and don't verify information against multimodal sources, limiting their applicability to reasoning-intensive settings with audiovisual media.

Method: Claim-centric approach with InfoF1 (factuality and information coverage) and CiteF1 (citation support and completeness), with both human and automatic evaluation variants.

Result: MiRAGE strongly aligns with extrinsic quality judgments when applied by humans, and automatic variants demonstrate limitations of text-centric metrics while laying groundwork for automatic evaluation.

Conclusion: MiRAGE provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating multimodal RAG systems, with open-source implementations available for assessing multimodal retrieval-augmented generation.

Abstract: We introduce MiRAGE, an evaluation framework for retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) from multimodal sources. As audiovisual media becomes a
prevalent source of information online, it is essential for RAG systems to
integrate information from these sources into generation. However, existing
evaluations for RAG are text-centric, limiting their applicability to
multimodal, reasoning intensive settings because they don't verify information
against sources. MiRAGE is a claim-centric approach to multimodal RAG
evaluation, consisting of InfoF1, evaluating factuality and information
coverage, and CiteF1, measuring citation support and completeness. We show that
MiRAGE, when applied by humans, strongly aligns with extrinsic quality
judgments. We additionally introduce automatic variants of MiRAGE and three
prominent TextRAG metrics -- ACLE, ARGUE, and RAGAS -- demonstrating the
limitations of text-centric work and laying the groundwork for automatic
evaluation. We release open-source implementations and outline how to assess
multimodal RAG.

*Jin Huang,Silviu Cucerzan,Sujay Kumar Jauhar,Ryen W. White*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Idea2Plan task and benchmark to measure LLMs' research planning capability, showing GPT-5 models perform best but with room for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically understand LLMs' capability in transitioning from conceptual research ideas to well-structured research plans, which is crucial for scientific discovery and autonomous research agents.

Method: Introduces Idea2Plan Bench built from 200 ICML 2025 papers with research ideas and grading rubrics, plus Idea2Plan JudgeEval to assess LLM-based judge reliability against expert annotations.

Result: GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini achieve the strongest performance on the benchmark, though substantial headroom remains for future improvement.

Conclusion: The study provides new insights into LLMs' research planning capability and lays groundwork for future progress in this area.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential to
accelerate scientific discovery as valuable tools for analyzing data,
generating hypotheses, and supporting innovative approaches in various
scientific fields. In this work, we investigate how LLMs can handle the
transition from conceptual research ideas to well-structured research plans.
Effective research planning not only supports scientists in advancing their
research but also represents a crucial capability for the development of
autonomous research agents. Despite its importance, the field lacks a
systematic understanding of LLMs' research planning capability. To rigorously
measure this capability, we introduce the Idea2Plan task and Idea2Plan Bench, a
benchmark built from 200 ICML 2025 Spotlight and Oral papers released after
major LLM training cutoffs. Each benchmark instance includes a research idea
and a grading rubric capturing the key components of valid plans. We further
propose Idea2Plan JudgeEval, a complementary benchmark to assess the
reliability of LLM-based judges against expert annotations. Experimental
results show that GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini achieve the strongest performance on the
benchmark, though substantial headroom remains for future improvement. Our
study provides new insights into LLMs' capability for research planning and lay
the groundwork for future progress.

*Deepon Halder,Alan Saji,Thanmay Jayakumar,Ratish Puduppully,Anoop Kunchukuttan,Raj Dabre*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RiddleBench is a new benchmark with 1,737 challenging puzzles designed to test multifaceted reasoning abilities that integrate logical deduction, spatial awareness, and constraint satisfaction - areas where current LLMs show fundamental weaknesses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning benchmarks primarily evaluate structured skills like quantitative problem-solving, leaving a gap in assessing flexible, multifaceted reasoning abilities central to human intelligence that require integrating logical deduction with spatial awareness and constraint satisfaction.

Method: The authors introduce RiddleBench, a benchmark of 1,737 challenging puzzles in English specifically designed to probe core reasoning capabilities that current evaluations don't measure well.

Result: Evaluation shows fundamental weaknesses in state-of-the-art models: Gemini 2.5 Pro (60.30%), o3 (63.37%), and Claude 4 Sonnet (63.16%) achieve accuracy just above 60%. Analysis reveals deep failures including hallucination cascades, poor self-correction due to self-confirmation bias, and fragile reasoning that degrades with constraint reordering or irrelevant information.

Conclusion: RiddleBench serves as a diagnostic tool for identifying reasoning weaknesses in LLMs and as a resource for guiding the development of more robust and reliable language models that can handle flexible, multifaceted reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated strong performance on many
established reasoning benchmarks. However, these benchmarks primarily evaluate
structured skills like quantitative problem-solving, leaving a gap in assessing
flexible, multifaceted reasoning abilities that are central to human
intelligence. These abilities require integrating logical deduction with
spatial awareness and constraint satisfaction, which current evaluations do not
measure well. To address this, we introduce RiddleBench, a benchmark of 1,737
challenging puzzles in English designed to probe these core reasoning
capabilities. Evaluation of state-of-the-art models on RiddleBench shows
fundamental weaknesses. Even top proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3,
and Claude 4 Sonnet achieve accuracy just above 60% (60.30%, 63.37%, and
63.16%). Analysis further reveals deep failures, including hallucination
cascades (accepting flawed reasoning from other models) and poor
self-correction due to a strong self-confirmation bias. Their reasoning is also
fragile, with performance degrading significantly when constraints are
reordered or irrelevant information is introduced. RiddleBench functions as a
diagnostic tool for these issues and as a resource for guiding the development
of more robust and reliable language models.

### [17] [Disaggregation Reveals Hidden Training Dynamics: The Case of Agreement Attraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24934)
*James A. Michaelov,Catherine Arnett*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes language model grammatical errors using psycholinguistic paradigms, identifying distinct training phases where models rely on heuristics like word frequency rather than generalized grammatical rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the intermediate stages of grammatical learning in language models by analyzing their error patterns in different syntactic contexts, as language models tend to make more errors in certain contexts despite generally producing grammatical text.

Method: Using paradigms from psycholinguistics, the researchers carried out fine-grained analysis of language model errors by disaggregating over carefully constructed datasets and comparing model performance across different conditions throughout training.

Result: The study identified distinct phases of training where language model behavior aligns with specific heuristics (such as word frequency and local context) rather than generalized grammatical rules, revealing intermediate learning stages.

Conclusion: This analytical approach serves as a powerful tool for understanding language model training dynamics, intermediate learning phases, and the specific generalizations learned by models, providing deeper insights into how language models acquire grammatical knowledge.

Abstract: Language models generally produce grammatical text, but they are more likely
to make errors in certain contexts. Drawing on paradigms from
psycholinguistics, we carry out a fine-grained analysis of those errors in
different syntactic contexts. We demonstrate that by disaggregating over the
conditions of carefully constructed datasets and comparing model performance on
each over the course of training, it is possible to better understand the
intermediate stages of grammatical learning in language models. Specifically,
we identify distinct phases of training where language model behavior aligns
with specific heuristics such as word frequency and local context rather than
generalized grammatical rules. We argue that taking this approach to analyzing
language model behavior more generally can serve as a powerful tool for
understanding the intermediate learning phases, overall training dynamics, and
the specific generalizations learned by language models.

### [18] [SemCoT: Accelerating Chain-of-Thought Reasoning through Semantically-Aligned Implicit Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24940)
*Yinhan He,Wendy Zheng,Yaochen Zhu,Zaiyi Zheng,Lin Su,Sriram Vasudevan,Qi Guo,Liangjie Hong,Jundong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemCoT is a novel implicit Chain-of-Thought framework that improves reasoning efficiency while preserving semantic alignment with ground-truth reasoning through contrastive training and knowledge distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing implicit CoT methods face two key challenges: poor semantic alignment between implicit reasoning and ground-truth reasoning leading to performance degradation, and neglect of the time cost for generating individual implicit reasoning tokens, hindering efficiency gains.

Method: Proposes SemCoT with two components: (1) a contrastively trained sentence transformer to evaluate and enforce semantic alignment between implicit and explicit reasoning, and (2) an efficient implicit reasoning generator using knowledge distillation from a lightweight language model guided by the sentence transformer.

Result: Extensive experiments show SemCoT achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: SemCoT is the first approach that jointly optimizes token-level generation speed and preserves semantic alignment with ground-truth reasoning, significantly enhancing CoT efficiency for deployment in efficiency-critical applications.

Abstract: The verbosity of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning hinders its mass deployment
in efficiency-critical applications. Recently, implicit CoT approaches have
emerged, which encode reasoning steps within LLM's hidden embeddings (termed
``implicit reasoning'') rather than explicit tokens. This approach accelerates
CoT by reducing the reasoning length and bypassing some LLM components.
However, existing implicit CoT methods face two significant challenges: (1)
they fail to preserve the semantic alignment between the implicit reasoning
(when transformed to natural language) and the ground-truth reasoning,
resulting in a significant CoT performance degradation, and (2) they focus on
reducing the length of the implicit reasoning; however, they neglect the
considerable time cost for an LLM to generate one individual implicit reasoning
token. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel semantically-aligned
implicit CoT framework termed SemCoT. In particular, for the first challenge,
we design a contrastively trained sentence transformer that evaluates semantic
alignment between implicit and explicit reasoning, which is used to enforce
semantic preservation during implicit reasoning optimization. To address the
second challenge, we introduce an efficient implicit reasoning generator by
finetuning a lightweight language model using knowledge distillation. This
generator is guided by our sentence transformer to distill ground-truth
reasoning into semantically aligned implicit reasoning, while also optimizing
for accuracy. SemCoT is the first approach that enhances CoT efficiency by
jointly optimizing token-level generation speed and preserving semantic
alignment with ground-truth reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of SemCoT compared to state-of-the-art methods in both
efficiency and effectiveness. Our code can be found at

### [19] [Language Model Behavioral Phases are Consistent Across Architecture, Training Data, and Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24963)
*James A. Michaelov,Roger P. Levy,Benjamin K. Bergen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Autoregressive language models show consistent behavioral patterns across architectures, datasets, and scales during pretraining, with 98% of word-level variance explained by three simple heuristics: word frequency, n-gram probability, and semantic similarity to context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether language models follow consistent learning trajectories regardless of their specific architecture, training data, or scale, and to identify the fundamental factors driving their behavior.

Method: Analyzed over 1,400 language model checkpoints across different architectures (Transformer, Mamba, RWKV), datasets (OpenWebText, The Pile), and scales (14M to 12B parameters) on over 110,000 English tokens.

Result: Found that 98% of variance in language model behavior at word level can be explained by three simple heuristics: unigram probability, n-gram probability, and semantic similarity to context. Models consistently progress through behavioral phases where they overfit to n-gram probabilities for increasing n during training.

Conclusion: Neural language models follow remarkably similar learning trajectories independent of model details, suggesting fundamental patterns in how they acquire language capabilities during pretraining.

Abstract: We show that across architecture (Transformer vs. Mamba vs. RWKV), training
dataset (OpenWebText vs. The Pile), and scale (14 million parameters to 12
billion parameters), autoregressive language models exhibit highly consistent
patterns of change in their behavior over the course of pretraining. Based on
our analysis of over 1,400 language model checkpoints on over 110,000 tokens of
English, we find that up to 98% of the variance in language model behavior at
the word level can be explained by three simple heuristics: the unigram
probability (frequency) of a given word, the $n$-gram probability of the word,
and the semantic similarity between the word and its context. Furthermore, we
see consistent behavioral phases in all language models, with their predicted
probabilities for words overfitting to those words' $n$-gram probabilities for
increasing $n$ over the course of training. Taken together, these results
suggest that learning in neural language models may follow a similar trajectory
irrespective of model details.

*Rabin Adhikari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Single-layer transformers with only 2 attention heads can achieve perfect performance on symbolic IOI tasks, revealing interpretable minimal circuits for coreference reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the minimal mechanisms required for specific reasoning tasks in transformers, overcoming the complexity of pretrained models that obscures interpretability.

Method: Train small attention-only transformers from scratch on symbolic IOI tasks, using residual stream decomposition, spectral analysis, and embedding interventions to analyze the circuits.

Result: A single-layer model with two attention heads achieved perfect IOI accuracy, with heads specializing into additive and contrastive subcircuits. A two-layer, one-head model also performed well through query-value interactions.

Conclusion: Task-specific training induces highly interpretable minimal circuits, providing a controlled testbed for studying transformer reasoning foundations.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer large language models
(LLMs) into human-understandable computational circuits. However, the
complexity of pretrained models often obscures the minimal mechanisms required
for specific reasoning tasks. In this work, we train small, attention-only
transformers from scratch on a symbolic version of the Indirect Object
Identification (IOI) task -- a benchmark for studying coreference -- like
reasoning in transformers. Surprisingly, a single-layer model with only two
attention heads achieves perfect IOI accuracy, despite lacking MLPs and
normalization layers. Through residual stream decomposition, spectral analysis,
and embedding interventions, we find that the two heads specialize into
additive and contrastive subcircuits that jointly implement IOI resolution.
Furthermore, we show that a two-layer, one-head model achieves similar
performance by composing information across layers through query-value
interactions. These results demonstrate that task-specific training induces
highly interpretable, minimal circuits, offering a controlled testbed for
probing the computational foundations of transformer reasoning.

### [21] [Evaluating Emotion Recognition in Spoken Language Models on Emotionally Incongruent Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25054)
*Pedro Corrêa,João Lima,Victor Moreno,Paula Dornhofer Paro Costa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLMs rely more on text semantics than acoustic features for speech emotion recognition, especially when speech and text convey conflicting emotions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate if spoken language models truly integrate audio and text modalities or rely predominantly on one modality, using emotionally incongruent speech samples.

Method: Tested four SLMs on speech emotion recognition using a dataset of emotionally incongruent speech where semantic content and speech expressiveness convey different emotions.

Result: SLMs predominantly rely on textual semantics rather than speech emotion cues, showing text representations dominate over acoustic representations.

Conclusion: Current SLMs have imbalanced modality integration with text dominating acoustic features, limiting their true multimodal understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Advancements in spoken language processing have driven the development of
spoken language models (SLMs), designed to achieve universal audio
understanding by jointly learning text and audio representations for a wide
range of tasks. Although promising results have been achieved, there is growing
discussion regarding these models' generalization capabilities and the extent
to which they truly integrate audio and text modalities in their internal
representations. In this work, we evaluate four SLMs on the task of speech
emotion recognition using a dataset of emotionally incongruent speech samples,
a condition under which the semantic content of the spoken utterance conveys
one emotion while speech expressiveness conveys another. Our results indicate
that SLMs rely predominantly on textual semantics rather than speech emotion to
perform the task, indicating that text-related representations largely dominate
over acoustic representations. We release both the code and the Emotionally
Incongruent Synthetic Speech dataset (EMIS) to the community.

*Nourah M Salem,Elizabeth White,Michael Bada,Lawrence Hunter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates LLMs' ability to identify both explicit and implicit knowledge gaps in biomedical literature, introducing TABI framework for structured reasoning and showing robust performance across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLMs' capability in systematically identifying research knowledge gaps, particularly extending beyond explicit gap detection to the novel task of inferring implicit gaps, which can support research formulation and funding decisions.

Method: Conducted experiments on 1500+ documents across four datasets using both closed-weight (OpenAI) and open-weight (Llama, Gemma 2) models under paragraph-level and full-paper settings. Introduced TABI (Toulmin-Abductive Bucketed Inference) scheme for structured reasoning in implicit gap inference.

Result: LLMs demonstrated robust capability in identifying both explicit and implicit knowledge gaps, with larger models performing better. Both open- and closed-weight models showed strong performance in systematically identifying candidate knowledge gaps.

Conclusion: LLMs have strong ability for systematically identifying knowledge gaps, supporting early-stage research formulation and funding decisions. Future directions include domain adaptation, human-in-the-loop verification, and benchmarking across model types.

Abstract: Scientific progress is driven by the deliberate articulation of what remains
unknown. This study investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
identify research knowledge gaps in the biomedical literature. We define two
categories of knowledge gaps: explicit gaps, clear declarations of missing
knowledge; and implicit gaps, context-inferred missing knowledge. While prior
work has focused mainly on explicit gap detection, we extend this line of
research by addressing the novel task of inferring implicit gaps. We conducted
two experiments on almost 1500 documents across four datasets, including a
manually annotated corpus of biomedical articles. We benchmarked both
closed-weight models (from OpenAI) and open-weight models (Llama and Gemma 2)
under paragraph-level and full-paper settings. To address the reasoning of
implicit gaps inference, we introduce \textbf{\small TABI}, a Toulmin-Abductive
Bucketed Inference scheme that structures reasoning and buckets inferred
conclusion candidates for validation. Our results highlight the robust
capability of LLMs in identifying both explicit and implicit knowledge gaps.
This is true for both open- and closed-weight models, with larger variants
often performing better. This suggests a strong ability of LLMs for
systematically identifying candidate knowledge gaps, which can support
early-stage research formulation, policymakers, and funding decisions. We also
report observed failure modes and outline directions for robust deployment,
including domain adaptation, human-in-the-loop verification, and benchmarking
across open- and closed-weight models.

### [23] [Can LLMs Estimate Cognitive Complexity of Reading Comprehension Items?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25064)
*Seonjeong Hwang,Hyounghun Kim,Gary Geunbae Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can estimate cognitive complexity of reading comprehension items by analyzing Evidence Scope and Transformation Level, showing potential for prior difficulty analysis, but reveal a metacognitive gap in identifying their own reasoning features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cognitive feature extraction for reading comprehension items relies on human annotation, as existing NLP tools cannot capture reasoning-based cognitive features like Evidence Scope and Transformation Level.

Method: Using large language models (LLMs) to estimate cognitive complexity by focusing on two dimensions: Evidence Scope (range of evidence needed) and Transformation Level (cognitive processing required) during answer reasoning.

Result: LLMs can approximate cognitive complexity of reading comprehension items, demonstrating potential as tools for prior difficulty analysis. However, they show a metacognitive gap - even when producing correct answers, they sometimes fail to correctly identify the reasoning features they used.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for estimating cognitive complexity in reading comprehension assessment, but their metacognitive limitations need addressing for more reliable cognitive feature identification.

Abstract: Estimating the cognitive complexity of reading comprehension (RC) items is
crucial for assessing item difficulty before it is administered to learners.
Unlike syntactic and semantic features, such as passage length or semantic
similarity between options, cognitive features that arise during answer
reasoning are not readily extractable using existing NLP tools and have
traditionally relied on human annotation. In this study, we examine whether
large language models (LLMs) can estimate the cognitive complexity of RC items
by focusing on two dimensions-Evidence Scope and Transformation Level-that
indicate the degree of cognitive burden involved in reasoning about the answer.
Our experimental results demonstrate that LLMs can approximate the cognitive
complexity of items, indicating their potential as tools for prior difficulty
analysis. Further analysis reveals a gap between LLMs' reasoning ability and
their metacognitive awareness: even when they produce correct answers, they
sometimes fail to correctly identify the features underlying their own
reasoning process.

### [24] [TOPol: Capturing and Explaining Multidimensional Semantic Polarity Fields and Vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25069)
*Gabin Taibi,Lucia Gomez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TOPol is a semi-unsupervised framework that reconstructs multidimensional narrative polarity fields using transformer embeddings, UMAP projection, and Leiden partitioning to quantify semantic displacement during discourse regime shifts under human-defined contextual boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sentiment analysis treats polarity as unidimensional, overlooking the complex multidimensional structure of language and semantic shifts in discourse.

Method: Embeds documents using transformer LLM, applies neighbor-tuned UMAP projection, segments topics via Leiden partitioning, computes directional vectors between topic-boundary centroids, and uses LLM for contrastive labeling of polarity vectors.

Result: TOPol successfully captures both affective (Amazon reviews) and non-affective (Central Bank speeches) polarity transitions, with robustness analyses showing only contextual boundary definitions significantly affect results.

Conclusion: TOPol provides a scalable, generalizable, and interpretable framework for context-sensitive multidimensional discourse analysis that handles both affective and non-affective semantic shifts.

Abstract: Traditional approaches to semantic polarity in computational linguistics
treat sentiment as a unidimensional scale, overlooking the multidimensional
structure of language. This work introduces TOPol (Topic-Orientation POLarity),
a semi-unsupervised framework for reconstructing and interpreting
multidimensional narrative polarity fields under human-on-the-loop (HoTL)
defined contextual boundaries (CBs). The framework embeds documents using a
transformer-based large language model (tLLM), applies neighbor-tuned UMAP
projection, and segments topics via Leiden partitioning. Given a CB between
discourse regimes A and B, TOPol computes directional vectors between
corresponding topic-boundary centroids, yielding a polarity field that
quantifies fine-grained semantic displacement during regime shifts. This
vectorial representation enables assessing CB quality and detecting polarity
changes, guiding HoTL CB refinement. To interpret identified polarity vectors,
the tLLM compares their extreme points and produces contrastive labels with
estimated coverage. Robustness analyses show that only CB definitions (the main
HoTL-tunable parameter) significantly affect results, confirming methodological
stability. We evaluate TOPol on two corpora: (i) U.S. Central Bank speeches
around a macroeconomic breakpoint, capturing non-affective semantic shifts, and
(ii) Amazon product reviews across rating strata, where affective polarity
aligns with NRC valence. Results demonstrate that TOPol consistently captures
both affective and non-affective polarity transitions, providing a scalable,
generalizable, and interpretable framework for context-sensitive
multidimensional discourse analysis.

*Nourah M Salem,Elizabeth White,Michael Bada,Lawrence Hunter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evaluation of generative LLMs for biomedical coreference resolution using CRAFT corpus, showing that entity-augmented prompting improves performance, though challenges remain with long-range context and ambiguity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biomedical coreference resolution faces unique challenges including complex terminology, ambiguous mentions, and long-distance dependencies, requiring specialized evaluation of LLMs in this domain.

Method: Used CRAFT corpus benchmark with four prompting experiments varying local context, contextual enrichment, and domain-specific cues (abbreviations, entity dictionaries), comparing generative LLMs against discriminative SpanBERT model.

Result: LLMs showed strong surface-level coreference capabilities with domain-grounding prompts, with LLaMA 8B and 17B achieving superior precision and F1 scores under entity-augmented prompting.

Conclusion: Lightweight prompt engineering can enhance LLM utility in biomedical NLP tasks, though performance remains sensitive to long-range context and mention ambiguity.

Abstract: Coreference resolution in biomedical texts presents unique challenges due to
complex domain-specific terminology, high ambiguity in mention forms, and
long-distance dependencies between coreferring expressions. In this work, we
present a comprehensive evaluation of generative large language models (LLMs)
for coreference resolution in the biomedical domain. Using the CRAFT corpus as
our benchmark, we assess the LLMs' performance with four prompting experiments
that vary in their use of local, contextual enrichment, and domain-specific
cues such as abbreviations and entity dictionaries. We benchmark these
approaches against a discriminative span-based encoder, SpanBERT, to compare
the efficacy of generative versus discriminative methods. Our results
demonstrate that while LLMs exhibit strong surface-level coreference
capabilities, especially when supplemented with domain-grounding prompts, their
performance remains sensitive to long-range context and mentions ambiguity.
Notably, the LLaMA 8B and 17B models show superior precision and F1 scores
under entity-augmented prompting, highlighting the potential of lightweight
prompt engineering for enhancing LLM utility in biomedical NLP tasks.

*Yun-Shiuan Chuang,Ruixuan Tu,Chengtao Dai,Smit Vasani,Binwei Yao,Michael Henry Tessler,Sijia Yang,Dhavan Shah,Robert Hawkins,Junjie Hu,Timothy T. Rogers*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DEBATE is the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating multi-agent LLM role-playing authenticity, containing 29,417 messages from human debates on 107 controversial topics, revealing gaps between simulated and authentic group dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM role-play setups produce unnatural dynamics without empirical benchmarks to measure authentic human opinion trajectories, creating a need for systematic evaluation of multi-agent interaction authenticity.

Method: Created DEBATE benchmark with 29,417 messages from 2,792 US participants discussing 107 controversial topics, capturing both public messages and private opinions. Used this to evaluate LLM role-playing and performed supervised fine-tuning for alignment.

Result: Identified critical discrepancies between simulated and authentic group dynamics. Supervised fine-tuning improved surface-level metrics (ROUGE-L, message length) but showed limitations in deeper semantic alignment (semantic similarity).

Conclusion: Role-playing LLM agents have potential for simulating human social dynamics but currently face limitations in achieving authentic semantic alignment, highlighting the need for improved multi-agent interaction modeling.

Abstract: Accurately modeling opinion change through social interactions is crucial for
addressing issues like misinformation and polarization. While role-playing
large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way to simulate human-like
interactions, existing research shows that single-agent alignment does not
guarantee authentic multi-agent group dynamics. Current LLM role-play setups
often produce unnatural dynamics (e.g., premature convergence), without an
empirical benchmark to measure authentic human opinion trajectories. To bridge
this gap, we introduce DEBATE, the first large-scale empirical benchmark
explicitly designed to evaluate the authenticity of the interaction between
multi-agent role-playing LLMs. DEBATE contains 29,417 messages from multi-round
debate conversations among over 2,792 U.S.-based participants discussing 107
controversial topics, capturing both publicly-expressed messages and
privately-reported opinions. Using DEBATE, we systematically evaluate and
identify critical discrepancies between simulated and authentic group dynamics.
We further demonstrate DEBATE's utility for aligning LLMs with human behavior
through supervised fine-tuning, achieving improvements in surface-level metrics
(e.g., ROUGE-L and message length) while highlighting limitations in deeper
semantic alignment (e.g., semantic similarity). Our findings highlight both the
potential and current limitations of role-playing LLM agents for realistically
simulating human-like social dynamics.

TL;DR: This research explores effective pretraining strategies for machine translation models targeting low-resource languages, with a focus on Lingala. The study builds on Reid and Artetxe's approach and demonstrates that multilingual pretraining using both monolingual and parallel data significantly improves translation quality for under-resourced languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the performance gap between high-resource and low-resource languages in machine translation, particularly for marginalized communities and underrepresented populations like those speaking Lingala and other African languages.

Method: The study employs various pretraining methodologies including integration of multiple languages (Afrikaans, Swahili, Zulu, Lingala) and uses both monolingual and parallel data during pretraining, building upon the approach by Reid and Artetxe (2021).

Result: Pretraining on multiple languages and leveraging both monolingual and parallel data significantly enhances translation quality for low-resource languages, helping bridge the performance gap with high-resource languages.

Conclusion: The research provides valuable insights into effective pretraining strategies for low-resource machine translation and contributes to developing more inclusive NLP models. Code and datasets are publicly available to support reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: This research article examines the effectiveness of various pretraining
strategies for developing machine translation models tailored to low-resource
languages. Although this work considers several low-resource languages,
including Afrikaans, Swahili, and Zulu, the translation model is specifically
developed for Lingala, an under-resourced African language, building upon the
pretraining approach introduced by Reid and Artetxe (2021), originally designed
for high-resource languages. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, we
explore different pretraining methodologies, including the integration of
multiple languages and the use of both monolingual and parallel data during the
pretraining phase. Our findings indicate that pretraining on multiple languages
and leveraging both monolingual and parallel data significantly enhance
translation quality. This study offers valuable insights into effective
pretraining strategies for low-resource machine translation, helping to bridge
the performance gap between high-resource and low-resource languages. The
results contribute to the broader goal of developing more inclusive and
accurate NLP models for marginalized communities and underrepresented
populations. The code and datasets used in this study are publicly available to
facilitate further research and ensure reproducibility, with the exception of

TL;DR: This survey systematically reviews over 180 papers on LLM unlearning since 2021, focusing on large-scale generative models. It introduces novel taxonomies for unlearning methods and evaluations, categorizing methods by training stage and providing critical analysis of evaluation approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs trained on massive corpora risk memorizing sensitive personal data, copyrighted material, and knowledge enabling malicious activities. Machine unlearning addresses these risks and aligns with legal/ethical standards like 'right to be forgotten' by selectively erasing specific knowledge while maintaining overall model performance.

Method: The survey introduces novel taxonomies categorizing unlearning methods into training-time, post-training, and inference-time based on when unlearning is applied. It also systematically compiles and critically analyzes existing evaluation datasets and metrics.

Result: The survey provides a comprehensive overview of LLM unlearning research, offering practical guidance through systematic categorization of methods and critical evaluation of assessment approaches across over 180 papers.

Conclusion: The comprehensive overview aims to inform and guide ongoing development of secure and reliable LLMs by addressing key challenges and identifying promising future research directions in machine unlearning.

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural
language processing, yet their training on massive corpora poses significant
risks, including the memorization of sensitive personal data, copyrighted
material, and knowledge that could facilitate malicious activities. To mitigate
these issues and align with legal and ethical standards such as the "right to
be forgotten", machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique to
selectively erase specific knowledge from LLMs without compromising their
overall performance. This survey provides a systematic review of over 180
papers on LLM unlearning published since 2021, focusing exclusively on
large-scale generative models. Distinct from prior surveys, we introduce novel
taxonomies for both unlearning methods and evaluations. We clearly categorize
methods into training-time, post-training, and inference-time based on the
training stage at which unlearning is applied. For evaluations, we not only
systematically compile existing datasets and metrics but also critically
analyze their advantages, disadvantages, and applicability, providing practical
guidance to the research community. In addition, we discuss key challenges and
promising future research directions. Our comprehensive overview aims to inform
and guide the ongoing development of secure and reliable LLMs.

*Shreyas Gopal,Ashutosh Anshul,Haoyang Li,Yue Heng Yeo,Hexin Liu,Eng Siong Chng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to disentangle semantic speech content from background noise in discrete audio representations, improving noise-invariant speech tokens and ASR performance while keeping Whisper frozen.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete audio representations are gaining popularity but are not optimized for noisy environments. Existing methods that quantize Whisper embeddings need improvement for real-world conditions with background noise.

Method: End-to-end model that separates clean speech as codebook tokens while extracting interpretable noise vectors as quantization residue, supervised via a lightweight classifier. The approach keeps Whisper frozen.

Result: 82% reduction in error rate compared to Whisper, 35% improvement over baseline methods on VBDemand test set. Produces noise-invariant speech tokens that improve alignment between clean/noisy speech and text.

Conclusion: The learned token space generalizes well to both seen and unseen acoustic conditions, demonstrating effective disentanglement of speech content from background noise in discrete representations.

Abstract: Discrete audio representations are gaining traction in speech modeling due to
their interpretability and compatibility with large language models, but are
not always optimized for noisy or real-world environments. Building on existing
works that quantize Whisper embeddings for speech-to-unit modeling, we propose
disentangling semantic speech content from background noise in the latent
space. Our end-to-end model separates clean speech in the form of codebook
tokens, while extracting interpretable noise vectors as quantization residue
which are supervised via a lightweight classifier. We show that our approach
improves alignment between clean/noisy speech and text, producing speech tokens
that display a high degree of noiseinvariance, and improves ASR performance.
Keeping Whisper frozen, we show an 82% reduction in error rate compared to
Whisper, and 35% improvement over baseline methods on the VBDemand test set.
Further analyses show that the learned token space generalizes well to both
seen and unseen acoustic conditions.

### [30] [Model-Document Protocol for AI Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25160)
*Hongjin Qian,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a framework that transforms unstructured documents into LLM-ready knowledge representations through agentic reasoning, memory grounding, and structured leveraging, with MDP-Agent implementation showing superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retrieval methods return raw passages that burden LLMs with fragment assembly and contextual reasoning, creating a need for a new retrieval paradigm that provides structured, consumable knowledge to LLMs.

Method: MDP framework defines three pathways: agentic reasoning (curating evidence into coherent context), memory grounding (accumulating reusable notes), and structured leveraging (encoding documents into formal representations like graphs). MDP-Agent implements this through document-level gist memories, diffusion-based exploration with vertical exploitation, and map-reduce synthesis.

Result: Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks show MDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the MDP framework's soundness and its agentic instantiation's effectiveness.

Conclusion: MDP successfully bridges the gap between raw documents and LLMs by transforming unstructured text into compact, structured knowledge that is directly consumable for reasoning, representing a new retrieval paradigm.

Abstract: AI search depends on linking large language models (LLMs) with vast external
knowledge sources. Yet web pages, PDF files, and other raw documents are not
inherently LLM-ready: they are long, noisy, and unstructured. Conventional
retrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw
passages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to
the LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that
redefines how models interact with documents.
  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that
formalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge
representations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP
defines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into
task-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates
raw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates
reusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes
documents into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All
three pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not
raw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for
reasoning.
  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol
through an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for
global coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical
exploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style
synthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient
context. Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks demonstrate that
MDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the soundness of the MDP
framework and the effectiveness of its agentic instantiation.

### [31] [Testing Cross-Lingual Text Comprehension In LLMs Using Next Sentence Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25187)
*Ritesh Sunil Chavan,Jack Mostow*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs perform well in English but struggle in low-resource languages like Hausa. Chain-of-Thought prompting helps weaker models but can hurt stronger ones through 'overthinking' in cross-lingual contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs' impressive performance reflects genuine ability or just data advantage from English-heavy training, by testing them in low-resource language settings where they can't rely on data abundance.

Method: Created a large-scale benchmark with 10,000 questions each for English, Swahili, and Hausa using Next Sentence Prediction (NSP). Tested GPT-4 Turbo, Gemini 1.5 Flash, and LLaMA 3 70B with and without Chain-of-Thought prompting.

Result: All models excelled in English but accuracy dropped in Swahili and fell sharply in Hausa, with LLaMA 3 struggling most. CoT significantly boosted LLaMA 3's accuracy but backfired for GPT-4 and Gemini, causing 'overthinking' that hurt their cross-lingual performance.

Conclusion: Chain-of-Thought is not a universal solution; its effectiveness depends on model's baseline capability and task context. The framework identifies LLM weaknesses and when CoT helps or hinders cross-lingual NSP performance.

Abstract: While large language models are trained on massive datasets, this data is
heavily skewed towards English. Does their impressive performance reflect
genuine ability or just this data advantage? To find out, we tested them in a
setting where they could not rely on data abundance: low-resource languages.
Building on prior work Agarwal et al. (2025) that used Next Sentence Prediction
(NSP) as a test, we created a large-scale benchmark with 10,000 questions each
for English (a high-resource language), Swahili (medium-resource), and Hausa
(low-resource). We then tested several top models, including GPT-4 Turbo,
Gemini 1.5 Flash, and LLaMA 3 70B, to see how their performance holds up. The
results painted a clear picture of how levels of language resources impact
outcomes. While all models excelled in English, their accuracy dropped in
Swahili and fell sharply in Hausa, with LLaMA 3 struggling the most. The story
became even more interesting when we introduced Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting. For the struggling LLaMA 3, CoT acted as a helpful guide,
significantly boosting its accuracy. However, for the more capable GPT-4 and
Gemini, the same technique often backfired, leading to a kind of "overthinking"
that hurt their results in the cross-lingual context. This reveals that
Chain-of-Thought is not a universal solution; its effectiveness depends heavily
on the model's baseline capability and the specific context of the task. Our
framework pinpoints LLM weaknesses, highlights when CoT helps or hinders
cross-lingual NSP performance, and factors influencing their decisions.

*Ziyi Liu,Bahar Sarrafzadeh,Pei Zhou,Longqi Yang,Jieyu Zhao,Ashish Sharma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProMediate is the first framework for evaluating proactive AI mediator agents in complex multi-party negotiations, featuring a simulation testbed with difficulty levels and a socio-cognitive evaluation framework with new metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need for agents that can proactively manage complex multi-party collaboration, but systematic evaluation methods for such proactive agents remain scarce, limiting progress in developing AI that can effectively support multiple people together.

Method: ProMediate consists of two core components: (1) a simulation testbed based on realistic negotiation cases with three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) and a plug-and-play proactive AI mediator grounded in socio-cognitive mediation theories, and (2) a socio-cognitive evaluation framework with metrics to measure consensus changes, intervention latency, mediator effectiveness, and intelligence.

Result: A socially intelligent mediator agent outperforms a generic baseline with faster, better-targeted interventions. In the ProMediate-Hard setting, the social mediator increases consensus change by 3.6 percentage points (10.65% vs 7.01%) while being 77% faster in response (15.98s vs. 3.71s).

Conclusion: ProMediate provides a rigorous, theory-grounded testbed to advance the development of proactive, socially intelligent agents in multi-party settings.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in agentic
frameworks to assist individual users, there is a growing need for agents that
can proactively manage complex, multi-party collaboration. Systematic
evaluation methods for such proactive agents remain scarce, limiting progress
in developing AI that can effectively support multiple people together.
Negotiation offers a demanding testbed for this challenge, requiring
socio-cognitive intelligence to navigate conflicting interests between multiple
participants and multiple topics and build consensus. Here, we present
ProMediate, the first framework for evaluating proactive AI mediator agents in
complex, multi-topic, multi-party negotiations. ProMediate consists of two core
components: (i) a simulation testbed based on realistic negotiation cases and
theory-driven difficulty levels (ProMediate-Easy, ProMediate-Medium, and
ProMediate-Hard), with a plug-and-play proactive AI mediator grounded in
socio-cognitive mediation theories, capable of flexibly deciding when and how
to intervene; and (ii) a socio-cognitive evaluation framework with a new suite
of metrics to measure consensus changes, intervention latency, mediator
effectiveness, and intelligence. Together, these components establish a
systematic framework for assessing the socio-cognitive intelligence of
proactive AI agents in multi-party settings. Our results show that a socially
intelligent mediator agent outperforms a generic baseline, via faster,
better-targeted interventions. In the ProMediate-Hard setting, our social
mediator increases consensus change by 3.6 percentage points compared to the
generic baseline (10.65\% vs 7.01\%) while being 77\% faster in response
(15.98s vs. 3.71s). In conclusion, ProMediate provides a rigorous,
theory-grounded testbed to advance the development of proactive, socially
intelligent agents.

Motivation: Address scarcity of annotated datasets and limited domain knowledge in general-purpose models for low-resource language domain-specific QA.

Method: Multi-stage finetuning using synthetic QA pairs generated by large LLMs (LLaMA-70B, Phi-14B) to augment limited original dataset, with exploration of various training methodologies.

Result: Large models efficiently generate synthetic data while small models effectively adapt to it, enabling domain generalization.

Conclusion: Provides scalable pathway for low-resource, domain-specific question answering through synthetic data augmentation and model adaptation.

Abstract: Domain-specific question answering in low-resource languages faces two key
challenges: scarcity of annotated datasets and limited domain knowledge in
general-purpose language models. In this work, we present a multi-stage
finetuning strategy to adapt lightweight language models to the Hindi tourism
domain by leveraging both original and synthetic training data. Synthetic
question-answer pairs are generated using large LLMs (LLaMA-70B, Phi-14B) and
used to augment the limited original dataset. We explore several training
methodologies and analyse their impact on domain generalisation. Our results
demonstrate that large models can efficiently generate synthetic data, while
small models can effectively adapt to it, offering a scalable pathway for
low-resource, domain-specific QA.

*Soumyadeep Jana,Sanasam Ranbir Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PEKD is a unified framework that enhances parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods for multimodal sarcasm detection in low-resource settings by distilling knowledge from an expert teacher model trained on large-scale data, using an entropy-aware gating mechanism to dynamically adjust distillation strength based on teacher confidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal sarcasm detection is challenging in low-resource settings due to scarce annotated data, making it hard to learn subtle image-text contradictions. Existing PEFT methods reduce overfitting but struggle to reach optimal performance with limited supervision from few-shot data.

Method: Propose PEKD framework that enhances PEFT methods via distillation from an expert teacher model trained on large-scale sarcasm data. Introduces an entropy-aware gating mechanism that dynamically adjusts distillation strength based on teacher confidence to mitigate unreliable signals.

Result: Experiments on two public datasets show that PEKD enables PEFT methods to outperform both prior parameter-efficient approaches and large multimodal models, achieving strong results in few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: PEKD is a modular and adaptable framework that can be applied to a wide range of multimodal models and tasks, effectively addressing the challenges of multimodal sarcasm detection in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection is challenging, especially in low-resource
settings where subtle image-text contradictions are hard to learn due to scarce
annotated data, which hinders the model's performance. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like adapters, LoRA, and prompt tuning reduce
overfitting but struggle to reach optimal performance due to limited
supervision from few-shot data. We propose PEKD, a unified framework that
enhances PEFT methods via distillation from an expert model trained on
large-scale sarcasm data, which acts as the teacher. To mitigate unreliable
signals from the teacher, we introduce an entropy-aware gating mechanism that
dynamically adjusts the distillation strength based on teacher confidence.
Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our PEKD framework enables
PEFT methods to outperform both prior parameter-efficient approaches and large
multimodal models, achieving strong results in the few-shot scenario. The
framework is modular and adaptable to a wide range of multimodal models and

*Senjie Jin,Lu Chen,Zhiheng Xi,Yuhui Wang,Sirui Song,Yuhao Zhou,Xinbo Zhang,Peng Sun,Hong Lu,Tao Gui,Qi Zhang,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Parrot is a novel training pipeline that enables mutual enhancement between Natural Language Chain-of-Thought (N-CoT) and Program Chain-of-Thought (P-CoT) paradigms for mathematical reasoning in LLMs, achieving significant performance improvements through integrated subtasks and reward mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research typically focuses on unidirectional enhancement between N-CoT and P-CoT paradigms, but the authors seek to fully unleash both paradigms' strengths for mutual enhancement and simultaneous improvements in mathematical reasoning.

Method: Proposed Parrot pipeline with: 1) Three target-designed subtasks integrating sequential P-CoT and N-CoT generation, 2) A subtask hybrid training strategy to facilitate natural language semantic transferability, and 3) Converted N-CoT auxiliary reward to alleviate sparse rewards in P-CoT optimization.

Result: Parrot significantly enhances both N-CoT and P-CoT performance, especially on N-CoT. Using Parrot SFT, LLaMA2 and CodeLLaMA achieve gains of +21.87 and +21.48 on MathQA over the RL baseline, which is resource-intensive.

Conclusion: The Parrot training pipeline successfully enables mutual enhancement between N-CoT and P-CoT paradigms, demonstrating substantial performance improvements in mathematical reasoning tasks while being more efficient than resource-intensive reinforcement learning approaches.

Abstract: Natural language chain-of-thought (N-CoT) and Program chain-of-thought
(P-CoT) have emerged as two primary paradigms for large language models (LLMs)
to solve mathematical reasoning problems. Current research typically endeavors
to achieve unidirectional enhancement: P-CoT enhanced N-CoT or N-CoT enhanced
P-CoT. In this paper, we seek to fully unleash the two paradigms' strengths for
mutual enhancement and ultimately achieve simultaneous improvements. We conduct
a detailed analysis of the error types across two paradigms, based on which we
propose Parrot, a novel training pipeline for mathematical problems: 1) Three
target-designed subtasks integrate sequential P-CoT and N-CoT generation. 2) A
subtask hybrid training strategy to facilitate natural language semantic
transferability. 3) The converted N-CoT auxiliary reward is designed to
alleviate the sparse rewards in P-CoT optimization. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Parrot significantly enhances both the performance of N-CoT
and P-CoT, especially on N-CoT. Using Parrot SFT, the N-CoT performance of
LLaMA2 and CodeLLaMA achieve gains of +21.87 and +21.48 on MathQA over the RL
baseline, which is resource-intensive.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CRMWeaver enhances business agents for complex data environments using synthesis data generation, RL training, and shared memories to improve handling of diverse tasks and unseen scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Business agents face challenges with intricate data relationships and heterogeneous tasks in complex real-world business environments, requiring improved capabilities for handling statistical queries and knowledge-based QA.

Method: Uses synthesis data generation and RL-based training paradigm to acclimate agents to business environments, plus shared memories mechanism during inference to learn from similar task guidelines.

Result: Achieves competitive results on CRMArena-Pro dataset in both B2B and B2C business scenarios, demonstrating effectiveness in complex settings.

Conclusion: CRMWeaver provides a practical solution for enhancing business agents' capabilities in handling complex data and varied tasks, showing strong generalization especially in unseen scenarios.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of LLM-based agents, which
shed light on using language agents to solve complex real-world problems. A
prominent application lies in business agents, which interact with databases
and internal knowledge bases via tool calls to fulfill diverse user
requirements. However, this domain is characterized by intricate data
relationships and a wide range of heterogeneous tasks, from statistical data
queries to knowledge-based question-answering. To address these challenges, we
propose CRMWeaver, a novel approach that enhances business agents in such
complex settings. To acclimate the agentic model to intricate business
environments, we employ a synthesis data generation and RL-based paradigm
during training, which significantly improves the model's ability to handle
complex data and varied tasks. During inference, a shared memories mechanism is
introduced, prompting the agent to learn from task guidelines in similar
problems, thereby further boosting its effectiveness and generalization,
especially in unseen scenarios. We validate the efficacy of our approach on the
CRMArena-Pro dataset, where our lightweight model achieves competitive results
in both B2B and B2C business scenarios, underscoring its practical value for
real-world applications.

*Abhishek Purushothama,Junghyun Min,Brandon Waldon,Nathan Schneider*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper argues against using large language models (LLMs) for legal interpretation, showing they produce unstable judgments with weak correlation to human reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To empirically test whether LLMs can reliably assist in legal interpretation, given recent proposals to incorporate them into legal practice.

Method: Conducted investigations in English testing LLMs' interpretive stability by varying question formats and comparing model outputs with human judgment.

Result: LLMs provide unstable interpretive judgments that vary dramatically with question format, showing only weak to moderate correlation with human judgment across different models.

Conclusion: It is dangerous to rely on generative AI conclusions for legal interpretation due to model instability and poor alignment with human reasoning.

Abstract: Legal interpretation frequently involves assessing how a legal text, as
understood by an 'ordinary' speaker of the language, applies to the set of
facts characterizing a legal dispute in the U.S. judicial system. Recent
scholarship has proposed that legal practitioners add large language models
(LLMs) to their interpretive toolkit. This work offers an empirical argument
against LLM interpretation as recently practiced by legal scholars and federal
judges. Our investigation in English shows that models do not provide stable
interpretive judgments: varying the question format can lead the model to
wildly different conclusions. Moreover, the models show weak to moderate
correlation with human judgment, with large variance across model and question
variant, suggesting that it is dangerous to give much credence to the
conclusions produced by generative AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether small-scale language models can benefit from instruction tuning and understand the trade-offs between interaction-focused adaptation and broad linguistic generalization.

Method: Compared conversational and question-answering instruction tuning datasets applied in merged or sequential curriculum using decoder-only models with 100M and 140M parameters. Evaluation included both fine-tuning (SuperGLUE) and zero-shot (BLiMP, EWoK, WUGs, entity tracking, psycholinguistic correlation) settings.

Result: Instruction tuning yields small but consistent gains in fine-tuning scenarios, with sequential curricula outperforming merged data. However, improvements do not consistently transfer to zero-shot tasks.

Conclusion: There's a trade-off between interaction-focused adaptation and broad linguistic generalization. The results highlight both potential and constraints of adapting human-inspired learning strategies to low-resource LMs, pointing toward hybrid, curriculum-based approaches for enhancing generalization under ecological training limits.

TL;DR: A data-driven pipeline using LLMs to forecast transformative technologies by detecting technological convergence patterns from scientific papers and patents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional expert-based forecasting methods struggle with fast-evolving ICT domains due to short innovation cycles and ambiguous early-stage terminology, creating a need for automated, scalable approaches.

Method: Uses LLMs to extract semantic triples from unstructured text, constructs technology entity graphs, applies noun stapling for grouping similar terms, and develops graph metrics for convergence detection with multi-stage filtering and temporal trend analysis.

Result: Validated on 278,625 arXiv preprints (2017-2024) and 9,793 USPTO patents (2018-2024), successfully identifying both established and emerging convergence patterns across scientific and commercial domains.

Conclusion: The pipeline provides a scalable, generalizable framework for technology forecasting through full-text analysis, enabling automated monitoring of transformative technology emergence.

Abstract: Forecasting transformative technologies remains a critical but challenging
task, particularly in fast-evolving domains such as Information and
Communication Technologies (ICTs). Traditional expert-based methods struggle to
keep pace with short innovation cycles and ambiguous early-stage terminology.
In this work, we propose a novel, data-driven pipeline to monitor the emergence
of transformative technologies by identifying patterns of technological
convergence.
  Our approach leverages advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract
semantic triples from unstructured text and construct a large-scale graph of
technology-related entities and relations. We introduce a new method for
grouping semantically similar technology terms (noun stapling) and develop
graph-based metrics to detect convergence signals. The pipeline includes
multi-stage filtering, domain-specific keyword clustering, and a temporal trend
analysis of topic co-occurence.
  We validate our methodology on two complementary datasets: 278,625 arXiv
preprints (2017--2024) to capture early scientific signals, and 9,793 USPTO
patent applications (2018-2024) to track downstream commercial developments.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline can identify both
established and emerging convergence patterns, offering a scalable and
generalizable framework for technology forecasting grounded in full-text
analysis.

*Junichiro Niimi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates how citation frequency affects hallucination rates in LLM-generated bibliographic references, finding that highly cited papers (over 1,000 citations) are nearly verbatimly memorized with lower hallucination rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the major issue of LLMs hallucinating non-existent papers in bibliographic recommendation tasks, and to test the hypothesis that citation count serves as a proxy for training data redundancy affecting factual accuracy.

Method: Used GPT-4.1 to generate 100 bibliographic records across 20 computer-science domains, manually verified them, and measured factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic metadata.

Result: Found that (i) hallucination rates vary across research domains, (ii) citation count strongly correlates with factual accuracy, and (iii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatimly memorized beyond approximately 1,000 citations.

Conclusion: Highly cited papers are nearly verbatimly retained in LLMs, indicating a threshold where generalization shifts into memorization, with citation count serving as a reliable predictor of factual accuracy in bibliographic outputs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range
of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they
have also been used to assist in bibliographic recommendation, the
hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior
studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce
bibliographic information depends on whether the underlying knowledge is
generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear
in the training corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume
citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency
with which a given bibliographic record is repeatedly represented in the
pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated
references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified
100 bibliographic records across twenty computer-science domains, and measured
factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic
metadata. The results revealed that (i) hallucination rates vary across
research domains, (ii) citation count is strongly correlated with factual
accuracy, and (iii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatimly
memorized beyond approximately 1,000 citations. These findings suggest that
highly cited papers are nearly verbatimly retained in the model, indicating a
threshold where generalization shifts into memorization.

Method: Created BhashaBench V1 with 74,166 meticulously curated question-answer pairs (52,494 English, 21,672 Hindi) sourced from authentic government and domain-specific exams across 4 major domains and 90+ subdomains.

Result: Evaluation of 29+ LLMs revealed significant domain and language performance gaps. GPT-4o achieved 76.49% accuracy in Legal but only 59.74% in Ayurveda. Models consistently performed better on English content across all domains. Cyber Law and International Finance performed well, while Panchakarma, Seed Science, and Human Rights remained weak.

Conclusion: BhashaBench V1 provides a comprehensive dataset for evaluating LLMs across India's diverse knowledge domains and enables assessment of models' ability to integrate domain-specific knowledge with bilingual understanding. All resources are publicly available.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models(LLMs) has intensified the need

authentic government and domain-specific exams. It spans four major domains:
Agriculture, Legal, Finance, and Ayurveda, comprising 90+ subdomains and
covering 500+ topics, enabling fine-grained evaluation. Evaluation of 29+ LLMs
reveals significant domain and language specific performance gaps, with
especially large disparities in low-resource domains. For instance, GPT-4o
achieves 76.49% overall accuracy in Legal but only 59.74% in Ayurveda. Models
consistently perform better on English content compared to Hindi across all
domains. Subdomain-level analysis shows that areas such as Cyber Law,
International Finance perform relatively well, while Panchakarma, Seed Science,

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Symphony is a new LLM serving system that serves programs (LIPs) instead of prompts, enabling runtime customization of token prediction and KV cache management while offloading application logic to the server for improved efficiency and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM serving systems are inefficient and inflexible for complex applications due to their text completion focus, lacking customization capabilities for token prediction and KV cache management.

Method: Proposed Symphony system architecture serving LLM Inference Programs (LIPs) that expose LLM computations via system calls, virtualize KV cache with a dedicated file system, and use two-level process scheduling for GPU efficiency.

Result: Symphony enables runtime customization of token prediction and KV cache management, allows offloading of application logic to server, and maintains GPU efficiency through optimized scheduling.

Conclusion: Symphony opens the door to a more efficient and extensible ecosystem for LLM applications by serving programs instead of prompts with flexible runtime customization capabilities.

Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) serving systems, primarily designed for
text completion, are neither efficient nor adaptable for increasingly complex
LLM applications due to their inflexible design. We propose a new LLM serving
system architecture that serves programs instead of prompts to address this
problem. These programs, called LLM Inference Programs (LIPs), allow users to
customize token prediction and KV cache management at runtime and to offload
parts of their application logic, such as tool execution, to the server. We
describe an example of this architecture through a system named Symphony, which
functions as an operating system for LIPs. Symphony exposes LLM model
computations via system calls and virtualizes KV cache with a dedicated file
system, while ensuring GPU efficiency with a two-level process scheduling
scheme. Symphony has the potential to open the door to a more efficient and

*Shakib Yazdani,Yasser Hamidullah,Cristina España-Bonet,Josef van Genabith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces an automated VLM-based framework for sign language dataset annotation and filtering, applied to TikTok videos across 8 sign languages, enabling scalable data acquisition from social media.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SLT datasets are limited in scale, lack multilingual coverage, and are costly to curate due to reliance on expert annotation and controlled recording setups.

Method: VLM-based pipeline including face visibility detection, sign activity recognition, text extraction from video content, and validation of video-text alignment for automated annotation and filtering.

Result: Created TikTok-SL-8 dataset across 8 sign languages; evaluated off-the-shelf SLT models on filtered data for German and American Sign Languages, establishing baselines for automatically extracted data.

Conclusion: The framework enables scalable, weakly supervised pretraining for SLT and facilitates data acquisition from social media while reducing reliance on manual effort.

Abstract: Most existing sign language translation (SLT) datasets are limited in scale,
lack multilingual coverage, and are costly to curate due to their reliance on
expert annotation and controlled recording setup. Recently, Vision Language
Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities as evaluators and real-time
assistants. Despite these advancements, their potential remains untapped in the
context of sign language dataset acquisition. To bridge this gap, we introduce
the first automated annotation and filtering framework that utilizes VLMs to
reduce reliance on manual effort while preserving data quality. Our method is
applied to TikTok videos across eight sign languages and to the already curated
YouTube-SL-25 dataset in German Sign Language for the purpose of additional
evaluation. Our VLM-based pipeline includes a face visibility detection, a sign
activity recognition, a text extraction from video content, and a judgment step
to validate alignment between video and text, implementing generic filtering,
annotation and validation steps. Using the resulting corpus, TikTok-SL-8, we
assess the performance of two off-the-shelf SLT models on our filtered dataset
for German and American Sign Languages, with the goal of establishing baselines
and evaluating the robustness of recent models on automatically extracted,
slightly noisy data. Our work enables scalable, weakly supervised pretraining
for SLT and facilitates data acquisition from social media.

### [44] [Implicature in Interaction: Understanding Implicature Improves Alignment in Human-LLM Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25426)
*Asutosh Hota,Jussi P. P. Jokinen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines how Large Language Models handle implicature (contextual meaning beyond literal statements) and shows that understanding implicature improves response quality, with larger models performing closer to human interpretations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advancing human-computer interaction requires attention to linguistic foundations, particularly implicature, which is essential for human-AI alignment and making interactions more natural.

Method: The study examines LLMs' ability to infer user intent embedded in context-driven prompts and tests whether understanding implicature improves response generation across different model sizes.

Result: Larger models approximate human interpretations more closely, while smaller models struggle with implicature inference. Implicature-based prompts significantly enhance perceived relevance and quality of responses, with 67.6% of participants preferring them over literal prompts.

Conclusion: Linguistic theory, particularly implicature understanding, can address the alignment problem by making human-AI interaction more natural and contextually grounded.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) is positioning language
at the core of human-computer interaction (HCI). We argue that advancing HCI
requires attention to the linguistic foundations of interaction, particularly
implicature (meaning conveyed beyond explicit statements through shared
context) which is essential for human-AI (HAI) alignment. This study examines
LLMs' ability to infer user intent embedded in context-driven prompts and
whether understanding implicature improves response generation. Results show
that larger models approximate human interpretations more closely, while
smaller models struggle with implicature inference. Furthermore,
implicature-based prompts significantly enhance the perceived relevance and
quality of responses across models, with notable gains in smaller models.
Overall, 67.6% of participants preferred responses with implicature-embedded
prompts to literal ones, highlighting a clear preference for contextually
nuanced communication. Our work contributes to understanding how linguistic
theory can be used to address the alignment problem by making HAI interaction
more natural and contextually grounded.

*Auguste Poiroux,Antoine Bosselut,Viktor Kunčak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLMEval is a new evaluation suite for neural theorem proving and proof autoformalization using research-level mathematics from real Lean formalization projects, revealing that current models perform poorly (10.3% pass rate) on these challenging tasks despite good results on curated benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited practical impact of large language models on research-level neural theorem proving and proof autoformalization, as progress on existing benchmarks doesn't translate well to real-world mathematical formalization.

Method: Created RLMEval evaluation suite comprising 613 theorems from 6 Lean Blueprint formalization projects, focusing on research-level mathematics from real-world formalization efforts.

Result: Evaluation of state-of-the-art models showed poor performance with only 10.3% pass rate, demonstrating that current progress on existing benchmarks doesn't translate to these more realistic research-level settings.

Conclusion: RLMEval provides a challenging new benchmark that better reflects real-world mathematical formalization needs and can guide future progress in automated reasoning for formal mathematics.

Abstract: Despite impressive results on curated benchmarks, the practical impact of
large language models (LLMs) on research-level neural theorem proving and proof
autoformalization is still limited. We introduce RLMEval, an evaluation suite
for these tasks, focusing on research-level mathematics from real-world Lean
formalization projects. RLMEval targets the evaluation of neural theorem
proving and proof autoformalization on challenging research-level theorems by
leveraging real Lean Blueprint formalization projects. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art models on RLMEval, comprising 613 theorems from 6 Lean
projects, reveals a significant gap: progress on existing benchmarks does not
readily translate to these more realistic settings, with the best model
achieving only a 10.3 % pass rate. RLMEval provides a new, challenging
benchmark designed to guide and accelerate progress in automated reasoning for
formal mathematics.

### [46] [Depth and Autonomy: A Framework for Evaluating LLM Applications in Social Science Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25432)
*Ali Sanaei,Ali Rajabzadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for using LLMs in qualitative social science research that classifies applications along two dimensions (interpretive depth and autonomy) to address challenges like bias, reliability, and auditability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address persistent challenges in adopting LLMs for qualitative social science research, including interpretive bias, low reliability, and weak auditability.

Method: Introduces a two-dimensional framework (interpretive depth and autonomy) to classify LLM applications, decomposing tasks into manageable segments similar to delegating work to research assistants, with low autonomy and selective interpretive depth increases under supervision.

Result: The framework provides a straightforward way to classify LLM applications and derive practical design recommendations for qualitative research while maintaining transparency and reliability.

Conclusion: By maintaining low autonomy and selectively increasing interpretive depth only where warranted under supervision, researchers can benefit from LLMs while preserving transparency and reliability in qualitative social science research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized by researchers across
a wide range of domains, and qualitative social science is no exception;
however, this adoption faces persistent challenges, including interpretive
bias, low reliability, and weak auditability. We introduce a framework that
situates LLM usage along two dimensions, interpretive depth and autonomy,
thereby offering a straightforward way to classify LLM applications in
qualitative research and to derive practical design recommendations. We present
the state of the literature with respect to these two dimensions, based on all
published social science papers available on Web of Science that use LLMs as a
tool and not strictly as the subject of study. Rather than granting models
expansive freedom, our approach encourages researchers to decompose tasks into
manageable segments, much as they would when delegating work to capable
undergraduate research assistants. By maintaining low levels of autonomy and
selectively increasing interpretive depth only where warranted and under
supervision, one can plausibly reap the benefits of LLMs while preserving
transparency and reliability.

### [47] [A Critical Study of Automatic Evaluation in Sign Language Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25434)
*Shakib Yazdani,Yasser Hamidullah,Cristina España-Bonet,Eleftherios Avramidis,Josef van Genabith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes limitations of text-based metrics for sign language translation evaluation, comparing traditional metrics (BLEU, chrF, ROUGE, BLEURT) with LLM-based evaluators under paraphrasing, hallucination, and sentence length variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SLT evaluation relies on text-based metrics like BLEU and ROUGE, but it's unclear how well these capture SLT quality. The study aims to identify limitations of existing metrics and motivate development of multimodal evaluation frameworks.

Method: Analyzed six text-based metrics (BLEU, chrF, ROUGE, BLEURT) and LLM-based evaluators (G-Eval, GEMBA) under three controlled conditions: paraphrasing, hallucinations in outputs, and sentence length variations to assess consistency and robustness.

Result: Lexical overlap metrics have significant limitations. LLM-based evaluators better capture semantic equivalence but show bias toward LLM-paraphrased translations. All metrics detect hallucinations, but BLEU is overly sensitive while BLEURT and LLM evaluators are lenient toward subtle cases.

Conclusion: Text-based metrics are insufficient for comprehensive SLT evaluation. There is a critical need for multimodal evaluation frameworks that go beyond text-based metrics to enable holistic assessment of sign language translation outputs.

Abstract: Automatic evaluation metrics are crucial for advancing sign language
translation (SLT). Current SLT evaluation metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE, are
only text-based, and it remains unclear to what extent text-based metrics can
reliably capture the quality of SLT outputs. To address this gap, we
investigate the limitations of text-based SLT evaluation metrics by analyzing
six metrics, including BLEU, chrF, and ROUGE, as well as BLEURT on the one
hand, and large language model (LLM)-based evaluators such as G-Eval and GEMBA
zero-shot direct assessment on the other hand. Specifically, we assess the
consistency and robustness of these metrics under three controlled conditions:
paraphrasing, hallucinations in model outputs, and variations in sentence
length. Our analysis highlights the limitations of lexical overlap metrics and
demonstrates that while LLM-based evaluators better capture semantic
equivalence often missed by conventional metrics, they can also exhibit bias
toward LLM-paraphrased translations. Moreover, although all metrics are able to
detect hallucinations, BLEU tends to be overly sensitive, whereas BLEURT and
LLM-based evaluators are comparatively lenient toward subtle cases. This
motivates the need for multimodal evaluation frameworks that extend beyond
text-based metrics to enable a more holistic assessment of SLT outputs.

*Fei Wei,Daoyuan Chen,Ce Wang,Yilun Huang,Yushuo Chen,Xuchen Pan,Yaliang Li,Bolin Ding*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Learn-to-Ask is a simulator-free framework that transforms passive LLMs into proactive dialogue agents using offline expert data, reframing policy learning by leveraging observed future trajectories to infer dense rewards and train structured action-state assessment policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for making LLMs proactive either optimize single-turn attributes or rely on brittle user simulators, creating a 'reality gap' that prevents effective deployment in high-stakes domains like healthcare.

Method: The framework leverages observed future trajectories from expert data to infer turn-by-turn rewards, decomposing long-horizon problems into supervised learning tasks. It trains policies to output structured (action, state_assessment) tuples and uses Automated Grader Calibration to purify LLM-based reward models with minimal human supervision.

Result: The method was successfully deployed in a live, large-scale online AI service using LLMs up to 32B. In rigorous evaluations, the model achieved performance superior to human experts on a real-world medical dataset.

Conclusion: Learn-to-Ask provides a practical and economically viable blueprint for transforming passive LLMs into proactive, goal-oriented applications that can bridge the reality gap and achieve tangible real-world impact.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel as passive responders, but teaching them
to be proactive, goal-oriented partners, a critical capability in high-stakes
domains, remains a major challenge. Current paradigms either myopically
optimize single-turn attributes or rely on brittle, high-cost user simulators,
creating a persistent ``reality gap''. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\texttt{Learn-to-Ask}, a general, simulator-free framework for learning and
deploying proactive dialogue agents \textit{directly from offline expert data},
bypassing the need to model complex user dynamics. Our key insight is to
reframe the offline policy learning problem by leveraging the \textbf{observed
future} of each expert trajectory. This allows us to infer a dense,
turn-by-turn reward signal grounded in the expert's revealed strategy,
decomposing the intractable long-horizon problem into a series of supervised
learning tasks, and training a policy to output a structured \texttt{(action,
state_assessment)} tuple, governing both \textbf{what to ask} and, crucially,
\textbf{when to stop}. To ensure reward fidelity, our Automated Grader
Calibration pipeline systematically purges noise from the LLM-based reward
model with minimal human supervision. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy
of \texttt{Learn-to-Ask} in a real-world medical dataset, using LLMs of varying
sizes up to 32B. Our approach culminates in the successful deployment of LLMs
into a live, large-scale online AI service. In rigorous in-house evaluations,
our model was launched and achieved performance even superior to human experts,
proving our framework's ability to translate offline data into tangible,
real-world impact. We hope this work provides a practical and economically
viable blueprint for transforming passive LLMs into proactive, goal-oriented
LLM applications.

TL;DR: A pipeline combining fine-tuned LLMs with NER for domain-specific text summarization and tagging, addressing challenges from evolving sub-cultural languages and slang in information extraction and law enforcement monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of rapidly evolving sub-cultural languages and slang that complicate automated information extraction and law enforcement monitoring, requiring efficient domain-specific text processing.

Method: Fine-tuned LLMs using LLaMA Factory framework on both general-purpose and custom domain-specific datasets (political and security domains), evaluated using BLEU and ROUGE metrics.

Result: Instruction fine-tuning significantly enhances summarization and tagging accuracy, especially for specialized corpora. LLaMA3-8B-Instruct outperforms Chinese-trained counterparts after domain-specific fine-tuning, showing reasoning capabilities transfer across languages.

Conclusion: The LLM-NER integration provides a scalable, adaptable solution for real-time applications, transforming unstructured text into actionable insights for modern knowledge management and security operations.

Abstract: This paper presents a pipeline integrating fine-tuned large language models
(LLMs) with named entity recognition (NER) for efficient domain-specific text
summarization and tagging. The authors address the challenge posed by rapidly
evolving sub-cultural languages and slang, which complicate automated
information extraction and law enforcement monitoring. By leveraging the LLaMA
Factory framework, the study fine-tunes LLMs on both generalpurpose and custom
domain-specific datasets, particularly in the political and security domains.
The models are evaluated using BLEU and ROUGE metrics, demonstrating that
instruction fine-tuning significantly enhances summarization and tagging
accuracy, especially for specialized corpora. Notably, the LLaMA3-8B-Instruct
model, despite its initial limitations in Chinese comprehension, outperforms
its Chinese-trained counterpart after domainspecific fine-tuning, suggesting
that underlying reasoning capabilities can transfer across languages. The
pipeline enables concise summaries and structured entity tagging, facilitating
rapid document categorization and distribution. This approach proves scalable
and adaptable for real-time applications, supporting efficient information
management and the ongoing need to capture emerging language trends. The
integration of LLMs and NER offers a robust solution for transforming
unstructured text into actionable insights, crucial for modern knowledge
management and security operations.

*Bangde Du,Minghao Guo,Songming He,Ziyi Ye,Xi Zhu,Weihang Su,Shuqi Zhu,Yujia Zhou,Yongfeng Zhang,Qingyao Ai,Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TwinVoice is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating persona simulation in LLMs across social, interpersonal, and narrative contexts, assessing six key capabilities where current models still lag behind human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of LLM-based persona simulation are limited by reliance on synthetic dialogues, lack of systematic frameworks, and insufficient analysis of capability requirements.

Method: The TwinVoice benchmark assesses persona simulation across three dimensions (Social, Interpersonal, Narrative Persona) and evaluates six fundamental capabilities: opinion consistency, memory recall, logical reasoning, lexical fidelity, persona tone, and syntactic style.

Result: Advanced models achieve moderate accuracy in persona simulation but perform poorly in syntactic style and memory recall. The average LLM performance remains significantly below human baseline.

Conclusion: While LLMs show emerging persona simulation capabilities, there are substantial gaps in key areas like syntactic style and memory recall that need to be addressed to achieve human-level performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are exhibiting emergent human-like abilities and
are increasingly envisioned as the foundation for simulating an individual's
communication style, behavioral tendencies, and personality traits. However,
current evaluations of LLM-based persona simulation remain limited: most rely
on synthetic dialogues, lack systematic frameworks, and lack analysis of the
capability requirement. To address these limitations, we introduce TwinVoice, a
comprehensive benchmark for assessing persona simulation across diverse
real-world contexts. TwinVoice encompasses three dimensions: Social Persona
(public social interactions), Interpersonal Persona (private dialogues), and
Narrative Persona (role-based expression). It further decomposes the evaluation
of LLM performance into six fundamental capabilities, including opinion
consistency, memory recall, logical reasoning, lexical fidelity, persona tone,
and syntactic style. Experimental results reveal that while advanced models
achieve moderate accuracy in persona simulation, they still fall short of
capabilities such as syntactic style and memory recall. Consequently, the
average performance achieved by LLMs remains considerably below the human
baseline.

*Run Peng,Ziqiao Ma,Amy Pang,Sikai Li,Zhang Xi-Jia,Yingzhuo Yu,Cristian-Paul Bara,Joyce Chai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies LLM agent collaboration in Einstein Puzzles under information asymmetry, finding that aligned communication and environmental verification improve task performance and rule understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLM agents' collaborative abilities in achieving joint goals under information asymmetry, where agents have different knowledge and skills but must work together.

Method: Extended Einstein Puzzles to a table-top game where two LLM agents reason, communicate, and act to satisfy spatial/relational constraints. Applied fine-tuning-plus-verifier framework with various communication strategies and environmental verification signals.

Result: Aligned communication is critical when agents have both information-seeking and -providing capabilities. Agents without communication achieved high performance but lacked true rule understanding and human trust. Environmental verification enhanced rule comprehension and task completion.

Conclusion: Integrating environment-based verifiers promotes safer and more interpretable AI collaboration by improving agents' task rule understanding and completion abilities.

Abstract: While Large Language Model (LLM) agents are often approached from the angle
of action planning/generation to accomplish a goal (e.g., given by language
descriptions), their abilities to collaborate with each other to achieve a
joint goal are not well explored. To address this limitation, this paper
studies LLM agents in task collaboration, particularly under the condition of
information asymmetry, where agents have disparities in their knowledge and
skills and need to work together to complete a shared task. We extend Einstein
Puzzles, a classical symbolic puzzle, to a table-top game. In this game, two
LLM agents must reason, communicate, and act to satisfy spatial and relational
constraints required to solve the puzzle. We apply a fine-tuning-plus-verifier
framework in which LLM agents are equipped with various communication
strategies and verification signals from the environment. Empirical results
highlight the critical importance of aligned communication, especially when
agents possess both information-seeking and -providing capabilities.
Interestingly, agents without communication can still achieve high task
performance; however, further analysis reveals a lack of true rule
understanding and lower trust from human evaluators. Instead, by integrating an
environment-based verifier, we enhance agents' ability to comprehend task rules
and complete tasks, promoting both safer and more interpretable collaboration
in AI systems. https://github.com/Roihn/EinsteinPuzzles

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FARSIQA is a novel Persian Islamic QA system using FAIR-RAG architecture that addresses hallucination and unfaithfulness in LLMs through adaptive query decomposition and iterative refinement, achieving 97.0% negative rejection and 74.3% correctness on IslamicPCQA benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face challenges with hallucination and unfaithfulness in high-stakes domains like religious QA, especially for Persian-speaking Muslims where accuracy is critical. Existing RAG systems fail on complex multi-hop queries requiring multi-step reasoning.

Method: FAIR-RAG architecture: Faithful, Adaptive, Iterative Refinement framework that dynamically decomposes queries, assesses evidence sufficiency, and iteratively generates sub-queries to fill information gaps using a curated knowledge base of 1M+ Islamic documents.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on IslamicPCQA benchmark: 97.0% Negative Rejection (40-point improvement over baselines) and 74.3% Answer Correctness score.

Conclusion: FARSIQA establishes new standard for Persian Islamic QA and validates that iterative, adaptive architecture is crucial for building faithful, reliable AI systems in sensitive domains.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Natural
Language Processing, yet their application in high-stakes, specialized domains
like religious question answering is hindered by challenges like hallucination
and unfaithfulness to authoritative sources. This issue is particularly
critical for the Persian-speaking Muslim community, where accuracy and
trustworthiness are paramount. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
systems, relying on simplistic single-pass pipelines, fall short on complex,
multi-hop queries requiring multi-step reasoning and evidence aggregation. To
address this gap, we introduce FARSIQA, a novel, end-to-end system for Faithful
Advanced Question Answering in the Persian Islamic domain. FARSIQA is built
upon our innovative FAIR-RAG architecture: a Faithful, Adaptive, Iterative
Refinement framework for RAG. FAIR-RAG employs a dynamic, self-correcting
process: it adaptively decomposes complex queries, assesses evidence
sufficiency, and enters an iterative loop to generate sub-queries,
progressively filling information gaps. Operating on a curated knowledge base
of over one million authoritative Islamic documents, FARSIQA demonstrates
superior performance. Rigorous evaluation on the challenging IslamicPCQA
benchmark shows state-of-the-art performance: the system achieves a remarkable
97.0% in Negative Rejection - a 40-point improvement over baselines - and a
high Answer Correctness score of 74.3%. Our work establishes a new standard for
Persian Islamic QA and validates that our iterative, adaptive architecture is
crucial for building faithful, reliable AI systems in sensitive domains.

TL;DR: This paper empirically studies test-time scaling (TTS) methods for legal multiple-choice QA, evaluating verifier-based approaches across five benchmarks using 7 reward models under realistic computation budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While TTS has proven effective in formal domains like mathematics and programming, its value in argumentative domains such as law remains underexplored, creating a research gap.

Method: The study uses verifier-based TTS methods including outcome-level (Best-of-N) and process-level (tree search) verification, evaluated with a family of 7 reward models under low-N computation budgets.

Result: The analysis systematically investigates how verifier utility is affected by key properties including domain specialization, model size, and supervision type (process-supervised PRMs vs. outcome-only ORMs).

Conclusion: The research provides empirical evidence on the effectiveness of TTS methods in legal domains and identifies key factors influencing verifier performance across different roles.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) techniques can improve the performance of large
language models (LLMs) at the expense of additional computation and latency.
While TTS has proven effective in formal domains such as mathematics and
programming \citep{snell2024scaling, chen2024more}, its value in argumentative
domains such as law remains underexplored. We present an empirical study of
verifier-based TTS methods for legal multiple-choice QA (MCQA) across five
benchmarks. Using a family of 7 reward models, we evaluate both outcome-level
(Best-of-$N$) and process-level (tree search) verification under realistic
low-$N$ budgets. Our analysis systematically investigates how verifier utility
is affected by key properties such as domain specialization, model size, and
supervision type (process-supervised PRMs vs. outcome-only ORMs), even when
applied across different roles.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework to evaluate language model reasoning efficiency by measuring how well they avoid unnecessary inferences when solving problems with irrelevant information, using logic programming to compare LM-generated proofs against shortest proofs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LM evaluations focus on correctness but overlook efficiency, which is crucial for human-like reasoning. Real-world scenarios often contain irrelevant information, and effective reasoning requires identifying and ignoring such distractions.

Method: The authors propose a framework using logic programming to align natural language proofs generated by LMs with shortest proofs found by executing logic programs. They construct a dataset of math word problems injected with varying numbers of irrelevant axioms that have different semantic overlap with the goal theorem.

Result: Current LMs show significant accuracy declines even with minimal, domain-consistent distractions. The proofs they generate frequently include detours through irrelevant inferences, indicating poor reasoning efficiency.

Conclusion: Standard LM evaluations are insufficient as they don't measure reasoning efficiency. LMs struggle with filtering irrelevant information, leading to inefficient proof generation, highlighting the need for efficiency-focused evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: Modern language models (LMs) exhibit strong deductive reasoning capabilities,
yet standard evaluations emphasize correctness while overlooking a key aspect
of human-like reasoning: efficiency. In real-world reasoning scenarios, much of
the available information is irrelevant, and effective deductive inference
requires identifying and ignoring such distractions. We propose a framework for
assessing LM reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming,
introducing a simple method to align proofs written in natural language -- as
generated by an LM -- with shortest proofs found by executing the logic
program. Efficiency is quantified by measuring how well a model avoids
unnecessary inference. Empirically, we construct a dataset of math word
problems injected with various number of irrelevant axioms that vary in
semantic overlap with the goal theorem. We find that current LMs show marked
accuracy declines under such conditions -- even with minimal, domain-consistent
distractions -- and the proofs they generate frequently exhibit detours through
irrelevant inferences.

TL;DR: EHR-Ins is a large-scale EHR reasoning dataset with 300k reasoning cases and 4M non-reasoning cases across 42 tasks, used to train EHR-R1 LLMs that outperform state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o by over 30 points on EHR benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs have limited EHR analysis capabilities due to narrow task coverage and lack of EHR-oriented reasoning, creating a gap in automated clinical decision-making.

Method: Developed EHR-Ins dataset using thinking-graph-driven framework, then trained EHR-R1 LLMs (up to 72B parameters) through multi-stage training including domain adaptation, reasoning enhancement, and reinforcement learning.

Result: EHR-R1 consistently outperforms SOTA commercial and open-source LLMs, surpassing GPT-4o by over 30 points on MIMIC-Bench and achieving 10% higher zero-shot AUROC on EHRSHOT.

Conclusion: The EHR-Ins dataset, EHR-R1 models, and EHR-Bench benchmark collectively advance reliable and clinically relevant EHR analysis capabilities.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich yet complex information, and
their automated analysis is critical for clinical decision-making. Despite
recent advances of large language models (LLMs) in clinical workflows, their
ability to analyze EHRs remains limited due to narrow task coverage and lack of
EHR-oriented reasoning capabilities. This paper aims to bridge the gap,
specifically, we present EHR-Ins, a large-scale, comprehensive EHR reasoning
instruction dataset, comprising 300k high-quality reasoning cases and 4M
non-reasoning cases across 42 distinct EHR tasks. Its core innovation is a
thinking-graph-driven framework that enables to generate high-quality reasoning
data at scale. Based on it, we develop EHR-R1, a series of reasoning-enhanced
LLMs with up to 72B parameters tailored for EHR analysis. Through a multi-stage
training paradigm, including domain adaptation, reasoning enhancement, and
reinforcement learning, EHR-R1 systematically acquires domain knowledge and
diverse reasoning capabilities, enabling accurate and robust EHR analysis.
Lastly, we introduce EHR-Bench, a new benchmark curated from MIMIC-IV, spanning
42 tasks, to comprehensively assess reasoning and prediction across EHR
scenarios. In experiments, we show that the resulting EHR-R1 consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art commercial and open-source LLMs (including
DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o), surpassing GPT-4o by over 30 points on MIMIC-Bench and
achieving a 10\% higher zero-shot AUROC on EHRSHOT. Collectively, EHR-Ins,
EHR-R1, and EHR-Bench have significantly advanced the development for more
reliable and clinically relevant EHR analysis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PairUni is a unified framework that reorganizes vision-language data into understanding-generation pairs and uses pair-aware reinforcement learning to balance these tasks in unified vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unified vision-language models need to handle both understanding and generation tasks, but these tasks rely on different data and supervision, making it challenging to balance them during reinforcement learning.

Method: The method involves: 1) Using GPT-o3 to augment single-task data by generating captions for understanding samples and QA pairs for generation samples, forming aligned pairs; 2) Retrieving semantically related understanding examples for generation samples to form retrieved pairs; 3) Implementing Pair-GPRO, a pair-aware variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization that uses similarity scores to modulate advantages and reduce task interference.

Result: The approach achieves balanced improvements on various unified vision-language models, outperforming strong UVLM RL baselines. A high-quality dataset of 16K UG pairs named PairUG was curated for RL fine-tuning.

Conclusion: PairUni successfully addresses the challenge of balancing understanding and generation tasks in unified vision-language models through paired data structures and pair-aware reinforcement learning optimization.

Abstract: Unified vision-language models (UVLMs) must perform both understanding and
generation within a single architecture, but these tasks rely on heterogeneous
data and supervision, making it difficult to balance them during reinforcement
learning (RL). We propose PairUni, a unified framework that reorganizes data
into understanding-generation (UG) pairs and aligns optimization accordingly.
We first use GPT-o3 to augment single-task data, generating captions for
understanding samples and question-answer (QA) pairs for generation samples,
forming aligned pairs from the same instance. Additionally, for each generation
sample, we retrieve a semantically related understanding example to form a
retrieved pair, linking different but related data points. These paired
structures expose cross-task semantic correspondences and support consistent
policy learning. To leverage this structure, we present Pair-GPRO, a pair-aware
variant based on Group Relative Policy Optimization. It assigns a similarity
score to each pair to modulate the advantage, strengthening learning from
well-aligned examples and reducing task interference. We curate a high-quality
dataset of 16K UG pairs named PairUG for RL fine-tuning and evaluate PairUni on
the powerful Janus-Pro UVLMs. Our approach achieves balanced improvements on
various UVLMs, outperforming strong UVLM RL baselines. Code:

TL;DR: This study compares zero-shot LLM classifiers with LightGBM for loan default prediction, finding LLMs have divergent feature importance rankings and unreliable self-explanations compared to SHAP analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' suitability for structured tabular data in high-stakes financial applications like risk assessment, where their performance and explainability remain underexplored.

Method: Systematic comparison between zero-shot LLM-based classifiers and LightGBM on real-world loan default prediction, using SHAP for feature attribution analysis and assessing LLM self-explanations.

Result: LLMs can identify key financial risk indicators but their feature importance rankings significantly diverge from LightGBM, and their self-explanations often don't align with empirical SHAP attributions.

Conclusion: LLMs have limitations as standalone models for structured financial risk prediction, requiring explainability audits, baseline comparisons with interpretable models, and human oversight in risk-sensitive financial environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as flexible
alternatives to classical machine learning models for classification tasks
through zero-shot prompting. However, their suitability for structured tabular
data remains underexplored, especially in high-stakes financial applications
such as financial risk assessment. This study conducts a systematic comparison
between zero-shot LLM-based classifiers and LightGBM, a state-of-the-art
gradient-boosting model, on a real-world loan default prediction task. We
evaluate their predictive performance, analyze feature attributions using SHAP,
and assess the reliability of LLM-generated self-explanations. While LLMs are
able to identify key financial risk indicators, their feature importance
rankings diverge notably from LightGBM, and their self-explanations often fail
to align with empirical SHAP attributions. These findings highlight the
limitations of LLMs as standalone models for structured financial risk
prediction and raise concerns about the trustworthiness of their self-generated
explanations. Our results underscore the need for explainability audits,
baseline comparisons with interpretable models, and human-in-the-loop oversight
when deploying LLMs in risk-sensitive financial environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Toolathlon is a comprehensive benchmark for language agents that spans 32 software applications and 604 tools, featuring realistic environment setups and execution-based evaluation to assess agents' ability to handle complex, multi-step workflows across diverse real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing language agent benchmarks focus on narrow domains or simplified tasks that lack the diversity, realism, and long-horizon complexity needed to evaluate real-world performance. There's a gap in benchmarks that can properly assess agents' capabilities in handling complex, multi-step workflows across diverse applications.

Method: Created Toolathlon benchmark with 32 software applications and 604 tools based on high-quality Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. Provides realistic initial environment states from real software (e.g., Canvas courses with students, financial spreadsheets). Includes 108 manually sourced/crafted tasks requiring interaction with multiple apps over ~20 turns on average, with strict verification through dedicated evaluation scripts.

Result: Evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals significant shortcomings: Claude-4.5-Sonnet achieves only 38.6% success rate with 20.2 tool calling turns on average, while top open-weights model DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp reaches 20.1% success rate.

Conclusion: Toolathlon addresses the limitations of existing benchmarks and is expected to drive the development of more capable language agents for real-world, long-horizon task execution by providing comprehensive evaluation of agents' performance across diverse applications and complex workflows.

Abstract: Real-world language agents must handle complex, multi-step workflows across
diverse Apps. For instance, an agent may manage emails by coordinating with
calendars and file systems, or monitor a production database to detect
anomalies and generate reports following an operating manual. However, existing
language agent benchmarks often focus on narrow domains or simplified tasks
that lack the diversity, realism, and long-horizon complexity required to
evaluate agents' real-world performance. To address this gap, we introduce the
Tool Decathlon (dubbed as Toolathlon), a benchmark for language agents offering
diverse Apps and tools, realistic environment setup, and reliable
execution-based evaluation. Toolathlon spans 32 software applications and 604
tools, ranging from everyday platforms such as Google Calendar and Notion to
professional ones like WooCommerce, Kubernetes, and BigQuery. Most of the tools
are based on a high-quality set of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that we
may have revised or implemented ourselves. Unlike prior works, which primarily
ensure functional realism but offer limited environment state diversity, we
provide realistic initial environment states from real software, such as Canvas
courses with dozens of students or real financial spreadsheets. This benchmark
includes 108 manually sourced or crafted tasks in total, requiring interacting
with multiple Apps over around 20 turns on average to complete. Each task is
strictly verifiable through dedicated evaluation scripts. Comprehensive
evaluation of SOTA models highlights their significant shortcomings: the
best-performing model, Claude-4.5-Sonnet, achieves only a 38.6% success rate
with 20.2 tool calling turns on average, while the top open-weights model
DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp reaches 20.1%. We expect Toolathlon to drive the development
of more capable language agents for real-world, long-horizon task execution.

*Aakriti Shah,Thai Le*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether persuasive prompting can recall factual knowledge from deliberately unlearned LLMs, showing that persuasive prompts significantly enhance factual recall, especially in smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unlearning in LLMs is crucial for managing sensitive data and correcting misinformation, but evaluating its effectiveness remains challenging. The study aims to determine if persuasive prompting can recover factual knowledge from unlearned models.

Method: The authors introduce the Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior Framework (SKeB), drawing from ACT-R and Hebbian theory. They model information entanglement via domain graphs and test factual recall correlation with persuasive framing across models from 2.7B to 13B parameters.

Result: Persuasive prompts substantially enhance factual knowledge recall (14.8% baseline vs. 24.5% with authority framing), with effectiveness inversely correlated to model size (128% recovery in 2.7B vs. 15% in 13B).

Conclusion: SKeB provides a foundation for assessing unlearning completeness, robustness, and overall behavior in LLMs, demonstrating that persuasive prompting can effectively recall knowledge from unlearned models.

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for managing sensitive
data and correcting misinformation, yet evaluating its effectiveness remains an
open problem. We investigate whether persuasive prompting can recall factual
knowledge from deliberately unlearned LLMs across models ranging from 2.7B to
13B parameters (OPT-2.7B, LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-2-13B). Drawing from
ACT-R and Hebbian theory (spreading activation theories), as well as
communication principles, we introduce Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior
Framework (SKeB), which models information entanglement via domain graphs and
tests whether factual recall in unlearned models is correlated with persuasive
framing. We develop entanglement metrics to quantify knowledge activation
patterns and evaluate factuality, non-factuality, and hallucination in outputs.
Our results show persuasive prompts substantially enhance factual knowledge
recall (14.8% baseline vs. 24.5% with authority framing), with effectiveness
inversely correlated to model size (128% recovery in 2.7B vs. 15% in 13B). SKeB
provides a foundation for assessing unlearning completeness, robustness, and
overall behavior in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Ouro is a family of pre-trained Looped Language Models that build reasoning into pre-training through iterative computation in latent space, entropy-regularized depth allocation, and scaling to 7.7T tokens, achieving superior performance matching 12B LLMs with smaller 1.4B-2.6B models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs rely on explicit text generation like chain-of-thought for reasoning, which defers reasoning to post-training and under-leverages pre-training data. The authors aim to build reasoning capabilities directly into the pre-training phase.

Method: Three key components: (1) iterative computation in latent space, (2) entropy-regularized objective for learned depth allocation, and (3) scaling to 7.7T tokens of pre-training data.

Result: Ouro 1.4B and 2.6B models match the performance of up to 12B state-of-the-art LLMs across a wide range of benchmarks. Controlled experiments show this advantage comes from superior knowledge manipulation capabilities rather than increased knowledge capacity.

Conclusion: LoopLM represents a novel scaling direction for reasoning capabilities, with reasoning traces more aligned with final outputs than explicit chain-of-thought. The approach shows potential for advancing reasoning in language models.

Abstract: Modern LLMs are trained to "think" primarily via explicit text generation,
such as chain-of-thought (CoT), which defers reasoning to post-training and
under-leverages pre-training data. We present and open-source Ouro, named after
the recursive Ouroboros, a family of pre-trained Looped Language Models
(LoopLM) that instead build reasoning into the pre-training phase through (i)
iterative computation in latent space, (ii) an entropy-regularized objective
for learned depth allocation, and (iii) scaling to 7.7T tokens. Ouro 1.4B and
2.6B models enjoy superior performance that match the results of up to 12B SOTA
LLMs across a wide range of benchmarks. Through controlled experiments, we show
this advantage stems not from increased knowledge capacity, but from superior
knowledge manipulation capabilities. We also show that LoopLM yields reasoning
traces more aligned with final outputs than explicit CoT. We hope our results
show the potential of LoopLM as a novel scaling direction in the reasoning era.

TL;DR: The paper argues for shifting from one-shot task completion agents to collaborative agents that work iteratively with humans, introducing a framework called collaborative effort scaling to measure how agent utility grows with user involvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agent evaluations focus on one-shot task completion, failing to account for the iterative and collaborative nature of real-world problems where human goals are often underspecified and evolve over time.

Method: Introduces collaborative effort scaling framework to capture how agent utility grows with increasing user involvement, using case studies and simulated evaluations to assess agent performance in multi-turn scenarios.

Result: State-of-the-art agents often underperform in multi-turn, real-world scenarios, revealing a missing ability to sustain engagement and scaffold user understanding throughout the problem-solving process.

Conclusion: Collaborative effort scaling provides a diagnostic lens for agent behavior and guides development toward more effective human-agent interactions that enhance human effort throughout the collaborative process.

Abstract: Current evaluations of agents remain centered around one-shot task
completion, failing to account for the inherently iterative and collaborative
nature of many real-world problems, where human goals are often underspecified
and evolve. We argue for a shift from building and assessing task completion
agents to developing collaborative agents, assessed not only by the quality of
their final outputs but by how well they engage with and enhance human effort
throughout the problem-solving process. To support this shift, we introduce
collaborative effort scaling, a framework that captures how an agent's utility
grows with increasing user involvement. Through case studies and simulated
evaluations, we show that state-of-the-art agents often underperform in
multi-turn, real-world scenarios, revealing a missing ingredient in agent
design: the ability to sustain engagement and scaffold user understanding.
Collaborative effort scaling offers a lens for diagnosing agent behavior and
guiding development toward more effective interactions.

*Chumeng Liang,Jiaxuan You*

TL;DR: DiagramEval is a novel evaluation metric that assesses LLM-generated demonstration diagrams by treating them as graphs with text elements as nodes and connections as edges, using node alignment and path alignment metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard image generative models struggle to produce clear diagrams with well-defined structure, and there's a lack of sufficiently discriminative and explainable metrics for evaluating LLM-generated diagrams despite their potential for creating diagrams directly as SVGs.

Method: DiagramEval conceptualizes diagrams as graphs, treating text elements as nodes and their connections as directed edges, and evaluates diagram quality using two groups of metrics: node alignment and path alignment.

Result: The method effectively evaluates diagrams produced by state-of-the-art LLMs on recent research literature, quantitatively demonstrating the validity of the metrics and providing enhanced explainability for insights into LLM-generated diagram characteristics.

Conclusion: DiagramEval provides a novel and effective approach for evaluating LLM-generated demonstration diagrams, offering valuable explainable metrics that address the current gap in diagram quality assessment.

Abstract: Diagrams play a central role in research papers for conveying ideas, yet they
are often notoriously complex and labor-intensive to create. Although diagrams
are presented as images, standard image generative models struggle to produce
clear diagrams with well-defined structure. We argue that a promising direction
is to generate demonstration diagrams directly in textual form as SVGs, which
can leverage recent advances in large language models (LLMs). However, due to
the complexity of components and the multimodal nature of diagrams,
sufficiently discriminative and explainable metrics for evaluating the quality
of LLM-generated diagrams remain lacking. In this paper, we propose
DiagramEval, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess demonstration
diagrams generated by LLMs. Specifically, DiagramEval conceptualizes diagrams
as graphs, treating text elements as nodes and their connections as directed
edges, and evaluates diagram quality using two new groups of metrics: node
alignment and path alignment. For the first time, we effectively evaluate
diagrams produced by state-of-the-art LLMs on recent research literature,
quantitatively demonstrating the validity of our metrics. Furthermore, we show
how the enhanced explainability of our proposed metrics offers valuable
insights into the characteristics of LLM-generated diagrams. Code:

TL;DR: DecompTune is a post-training method that teaches LLMs to generate answer decompositions as intermediate reasoning steps, improving attribution quality for complex QA tasks by reframing attribution as a reasoning problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing post-hoc attribution methods work well for extractive QA but struggle with multi-hop, abstractive, and semi-extractive settings where answers synthesize information across multiple passages, highlighting the need for better attribution in complex QA scenarios.

Method: DecompTune uses a two-stage SFT + GRPO pipeline with task-specific curated rewards to post-train models (Qwen-2.5 7B and 14B) on a diverse dataset of complex QA tasks annotated with decompositions by a strong LLM, teaching models to produce answer decompositions as intermediate reasoning steps.

Result: DecompTune substantially improves attribution quality, outperforming prior methods and matching or exceeding state-of-the-art frontier models across extensive experiments and ablations.

Conclusion: Reframing post-hoc attribution as a reasoning problem through answer decomposition significantly enhances attribution quality in complex QA settings, with DecompTune demonstrating strong performance improvements over existing approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for long-document question
answering, where reliable attribution to sources is critical for trust.
Existing post-hoc attribution methods work well for extractive QA but struggle
in multi-hop, abstractive, and semi-extractive settings, where answers
synthesize information across passages. To address these challenges, we argue
that post-hoc attribution can be reframed as a reasoning problem, where answers
are decomposed into constituent units, each tied to specific context. We first
show that prompting models to generate such decompositions alongside
attributions improves performance. Building on this, we introduce DecompTune, a
post-training method that teaches models to produce answer decompositions as
intermediate reasoning steps. We curate a diverse dataset of complex QA tasks,
annotated with decompositions by a strong LLM, and post-train Qwen-2.5 (7B and
14B) using a two-stage SFT + GRPO pipeline with task-specific curated rewards.
Across extensive experiments and ablations, DecompTune substantially improves
attribution quality, outperforming prior methods and matching or exceeding

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance transparency and reproducibility in large-scale model training by providing a fully open foundation for exploring trade-offs between data curation, evaluation, safety, and openness in multilingual language model development.

Method: Training French-English-coding models on 2-4 trillion tokens using neural quality filtering for French/English datasets, efficient data curation framework, and studying data filtering/contamination effects. Includes deliberate contamination experiments and harmless data poisoning for safety studies.

Result: Found that linguistic quality filtering enhances text fluency but yields subpar benchmark results, while late deliberate contamination recovers competitive scores with reasonable generation quality harm. Neural filtering can unintentionally amplify benchmark leakage.

Conclusion: Gaperon establishes a reproducible foundation for studying data curation-evaluation-safety trade-offs in multilingual LM development, demonstrating how filtering and contamination strategies interact to shape both benchmark and generative performance.

Abstract: We release Gaperon, a fully open suite of French-English-coding language
models designed to advance transparency and reproducibility in large-scale
model training. The Gaperon family includes 1.5B, 8B, and 24B parameter models
trained on 2-4 trillion tokens, released with all elements of the training
pipeline: French and English datasets filtered with a neural quality
classifier, an efficient data curation and training framework, and hundreds of
intermediate checkpoints. Through this work, we study how data filtering and
contamination interact to shape both benchmark and generative performance. We
find that filtering for linguistic quality enhances text fluency and coherence
but yields subpar benchmark results, and that late deliberate contamination --
continuing training on data mixes that include test sets -- recovers
competitive scores while only reasonably harming generation quality. We discuss
how usual neural filtering can unintentionally amplify benchmark leakage. To
support further research, we also introduce harmless data poisoning during
pretraining, providing a realistic testbed for safety studies. By openly
releasing all models, datasets, code, and checkpoints, Gaperon establishes a
reproducible foundation for exploring the trade-offs between data curation,
evaluation, safety, and openness in multilingual language model development.

*Vladyslav Larin,Ihor Naumenko,Aleksei Ivashov,Ivan Nikitin,Alexander Firsov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fortytwo is a decentralized AI inference protocol that uses swarm intelligence and pairwise ranking consensus to achieve superior performance over traditional methods like majority voting, with strong security features including proof-of-capability and reputation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized AI faces compute limitations and diminishing returns from large training runs, requiring a scalable inference solution that can grow horizontally in both capacity and capability.

Method: Uses swarm inference with peer-ranked, reputation-weighted consensus across heterogeneous models, employing pairwise ranking with Bradley-Terry-style aggregation and proof-of-capability for Sybil resistance.

Result: Achieves 85.90% on GPQA Diamond vs 68.69% for majority voting (+17.21 percentage points improvement), shows strong resilience to adversarial prompts (only 0.12% degradation vs 6.20% baseline), and performs well across six challenging benchmarks.

Conclusion: Establishes foundation for decentralized AI systems that democratize access to high-quality inference through collective intelligence while maintaining reliability and security.

Abstract: As centralized AI hits compute ceilings and diminishing returns from
ever-larger training runs, meeting demand requires an inference layer that
scales horizontally in both capacity and capability. We present Fortytwo, a
novel protocol that leverages swarm intelligence principles and distributed
pairwise ranking consensus to achieve superior performance in AI inference. Our
approach reimagines collaboration among AI nodes using swarm inference: a
peer-ranked, reputation-weighted consensus across heterogeneous models that
surfaces the highest-quality responses. Using pairwise ranking with a custom
Bradley-Terry-style aggregation model, we demonstrate that swarm inference
substantially outperforms majority voting, achieving 85.90% on GPQA Diamond
versus 68.69% for majority voting with the same model set - an improvement of
+17.21 percentage points (approximately +25.1% relative). The protocol
incorporates on-chain reputation so node influence adapts to demonstrated
accuracy over time, yielding a meritocratic consensus that filters low-quality
or malicious participants. To resist Sybil attacks, Fortytwo employs
proof-of-capability in its consensus: nodes must successfully complete
calibration/test requests and stake reputation to enter ranking rounds, making
multi-identity attacks economically unattractive while preserving openness.
Across six challenging benchmarks, including GPQA Diamond, LiveCodeBench, and
AIME, our evaluation indicates higher accuracy and strong resilience to
adversarial and noisy free-form prompting (e.g., prompt-injection degradation
of only 0.12% versus 6.20% for a monolithic single-model baseline), while
retaining practical deployability. Together, these results establish a
foundation for decentralized AI systems - democratizing access to high-quality
inference through collective intelligence without sacrificing reliability or
security.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides a formal analysis of weak-to-strong generalization in CNNs, identifying two regimes (data-scarce and data-abundant) with distinct mechanisms and revealing that overtraining can degrade performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide concrete theoretical insights into weak-to-strong generalization beyond abstract frameworks, specifically analyzing how a stronger model trained with supervision from a weaker one can outperform its teacher in convolutional neural networks.

Method: Analyzed gradient descent dynamics when a two-layer ReLU CNN (strong) is trained on data labeled by a pretrained linear CNN (weak), using structured data with label-dependent signals of varying difficulty and label-independent noise.

Result: Identified two regimes: data-scarce regime where generalization occurs via benign overfitting or fails via harmful overfitting, and data-abundant regime where generalization emerges through label correction but overtraining degrades performance. Characterized the transition boundary between regimes.

Conclusion: Weak-to-strong generalization exhibits distinct mechanisms depending on data characteristics, with overtraining being detrimental in data-abundant scenarios despite initial performance gains through label correction.

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization refers to the phenomenon where a stronger model
trained under supervision from a weaker one can outperform its teacher. While
prior studies aim to explain this effect, most theoretical insights are limited
to abstract frameworks or linear/random feature models. In this paper, we
provide a formal analysis of weak-to-strong generalization from a linear CNN
(weak) to a two-layer ReLU CNN (strong). We consider structured data composed
of label-dependent signals of varying difficulty and label-independent noise,
and analyze gradient descent dynamics when the strong model is trained on data
labeled by the pretrained weak model. Our analysis identifies two regimes --
data-scarce and data-abundant -- based on the signal-to-noise characteristics
of the dataset, and reveals distinct mechanisms of weak-to-strong
generalization. In the data-scarce regime, generalization occurs via benign
overfitting or fails via harmful overfitting, depending on the amount of data,
and we characterize the transition boundary. In the data-abundant regime,
generalization emerges in the early phase through label correction, but we
observe that overtraining can subsequently degrade performance.

Conclusion: GraphFLA provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing fitness landscape topography, enabling better evaluation and comparison of machine learning models that predict mutational effects across diverse biological modalities.

Abstract: Machine learning models increasingly map biological sequence-fitness
landscapes to predict mutational effects. Effective evaluation of these models
requires benchmarks curated from empirical data. Despite their impressive
scales, existing benchmarks lack topographical information regarding the
underlying fitness landscapes, which hampers interpretation and comparison of

framework that constructs and analyzes fitness landscapes from mutagensis data
in diverse modalities (e.g., DNA, RNA, protein, and beyond) with up to millions
of mutants. GraphFLA calculates 20 biologically relevant features that
characterize 4 fundamental aspects of landscape topography. By applying
GraphFLA to over 5,300 landscapes from ProteinGym, RNAGym, and CIS-BP, we
demonstrate its utility in interpreting and comparing the performance of dozens
of fitness prediction models, highlighting factors influencing model accuracy
and respective advantages of different models. In addition, we release 155

TL;DR: This paper explores using TinyML and compressed CNNs on ESP32-S3 microcontrollers for environmental monitoring IoT applications, showing that on-device inference reduces energy consumption by up to 5x compared to transmitting raw image data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Environmental monitoring requires energy-efficient IoT devices for long-term operation in remote areas with limited power. Data transfer is energy-intensive, so performing inference directly on microcontrollers can extend device lifespan.

Method: The study evaluates common Low Power Wide Area Networks and compressed CNNs trained on domain-specific datasets on ESP32-S3 microcontrollers, using Post Training Quantization for model compression.

Result: Executing CNN inference on-device and transmitting only the results reduces overall energy consumption by up to 5x compared to sending raw image data. Model compression via quantization causes only minimal accuracy reduction.

Conclusion: These findings support developing IoT applications with reduced carbon footprint capable of autonomous operation in environmental monitoring by incorporating Embedded Machine Learning.

Abstract: The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence
offers significant opportunities to enhance our ability to monitor and address
ecological changes. As environmental challenges become increasingly pressing,
the need for effective remote monitoring solutions is more critical than ever.
A major challenge in designing IoT applications for environmental monitoring -
particularly those involving image data - is to create energy-efficient IoT
devices capable of long-term operation in remote areas with limited power
availability. Advancements in the field of Tiny Machine Learning allow the use
of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on resource-constrained,
battery-operated microcontrollers. Since data transfer is energy-intensive,
performing inference directly on microcontrollers to reduce the message size
can extend the operational lifespan of IoT nodes. This work evaluates the use
of common Low Power Wide Area Networks and compressed CNNs trained on domain
specific datasets on an ESP32-S3. Our experiments demonstrate, among other
things, that executing CNN inference on-device and transmitting only the
results reduces the overall energy consumption by a factor of up to five
compared to sending raw image data. %The compression of the model using Post
Training Quantization is accompanied by an acceptable reduction in accuracy of
only a few percentage points compared to a non-quantized model. These findings
advocate the development of IoT applications with reduced carbon footprint and
capable of operating autonomously in environmental monitoring scenarios by
incorporating Embedded Machine Learning.

### [69] [Aggregation Hides Out-of-Distribution Generalization Failures from Spurious Correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24884)
*Olawale Salaudeen,Haoran Zhang,Kumail Alhamoud,Sara Beery,Marzyeh Ghassemi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper challenges the common finding that in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracy are positively correlated, showing this is often an artifact of aggregating heterogeneous OOD examples. Using OODSelect, they identify coherent OOD subsets where higher ID accuracy actually predicts lower OOD accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether the commonly observed positive correlation between ID and OOD accuracy ("accuracy-on-the-line") is genuine or an artifact of aggregation, and to uncover potential spurious correlations that are masked by aggregate metrics.

Method: Developed OODSelect, a gradient-based method to identify semantically coherent OOD subsets where the positive correlation between ID and OOD accuracy breaks down, revealing subsets where higher ID accuracy predicts lower OOD accuracy.

Result: Across widely used distribution shift benchmarks, OODSelect identified subsets (sometimes over half of the standard OOD set) where accuracy-on-the-line does not hold, showing that aggregate metrics can obscure important failure modes of OOD robustness.

Conclusion: The positive correlation between ID and OOD accuracy is often an artifact of aggregating heterogeneous OOD examples, and aggregate metrics can mask significant OOD robustness failures. The authors release code and identified subsets to facilitate further research.

Abstract: Benchmarks for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization frequently show a
strong positive correlation between in-distribution (ID) and OOD accuracy
across models, termed "accuracy-on-the-line." This pattern is often taken to
imply that spurious correlations - correlations that improve ID but reduce OOD
performance - are rare in practice. We find that this positive correlation is
often an artifact of aggregating heterogeneous OOD examples. Using a simple
gradient-based method, OODSelect, we identify semantically coherent OOD subsets
where accuracy on the line does not hold. Across widely used distribution shift
benchmarks, the OODSelect uncovers subsets, sometimes over half of the standard
OOD set, where higher ID accuracy predicts lower OOD accuracy. Our findings
indicate that aggregate metrics can obscure important failure modes of OOD
robustness. We release code and the identified subsets to facilitate further
research.

*Shakeel Abdulkareem,Bora Yimenicioglu,Andrea Yang,Khartik Uppalapati,Aneesh Gudipati,Zhaoyang Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An adaptive multitask EEG classifier using GRU-TCN with DQN threshold adaptation achieves 98.0% accuracy for stroke type classification, outperforming baseline models and demonstrating robust performance across different EEG datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rapid triage of suspected stroke requires accurate, bedside-deployable tools, and EEG shows promise but is underutilized at first contact. The goal is to develop an adaptive system that can classify stroke type, lateralization, and severity in real-time clinical settings.

Method: The system converts 32-channel EEG signals to power spectral density features using Welch method, employs a recurrent-convolutional network (GRU-TCN) to predict stroke type (healthy, ischemic, hemorrhagic), hemispheric lateralization, and severity, and applies a deep Q-network (DQN) to tune decision thresholds in real time.

Result: Baseline GRU-TCN achieved 89.3% accuracy (F1 92.8%) for stroke type, 96.9% (F1 95.9%) for severity, and 96.7% (F1 97.4%) for lateralization. With DQN threshold adaptation, stroke-type accuracy increased to 98.0% (F1 97.7%). The system also showed robustness on an independent low-density EEG cohort.

Conclusion: Adaptive thresholding enables clinically preferred sensitivity-specificity trade-offs, while integrated visualizations support interpretability, making this EEG-based approach promising for rapid stroke triage at the bedside.

Abstract: Rapid triage of suspected stroke needs accurate, bedside-deployable tools;
EEG is promising but underused at first contact. We present an adaptive
multitask EEG classifier that converts 32-channel signals to power spectral
density features (Welch), uses a recurrent-convolutional network (GRU-TCN) to
predict stroke type (healthy, ischemic, hemorrhagic), hemispheric
lateralization, and severity, and applies a deep Q-network (DQN) to tune
decision thresholds in real time. Using a patient-wise split of the UCLH Stroke
EIT/EEG data set (44 recordings; about 26 acute stroke, 10 controls), the
primary outcome was stroke-type performance; secondary outcomes were severity
and lateralization. The baseline GRU-TCN reached 89.3% accuracy (F1 92.8%) for
stroke type, about 96.9% (F1 95.9%) for severity, and about 96.7% (F1 97.4%)
for lateralization. With DQN threshold adaptation, stroke-type accuracy
increased to about 98.0% (F1 97.7%). We also tested robustness on an
independent, low-density EEG cohort (ZJU4H) and report paired patient-level
statistics. Analyses follow STARD 2015 guidance for diagnostic accuracy studies
(index test: GRU-TCN+DQN; reference standard: radiology/clinical diagnosis;
patient-wise evaluation). Adaptive thresholding shifts the operating point to
clinically preferred sensitivity-specificity trade-offs, while integrated
scalp-map and spectral visualizations support interpretability.

*Biyi Fang,Kripa Rajshekhar,Truong Vo,Diego Klabjan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: nnLDA is a neural-augmented topic model that incorporates side information through a neural prior mechanism, outperforming traditional models like LDA in topic coherence, perplexity, and classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional topic models like LDA struggle to integrate auxiliary information such as metadata, user attributes, or document labels, limiting their expressiveness, personalization, and interpretability.

Method: nnLDA models documents as mixtures of latent topics with a neural network generating the prior over topic proportions conditioned on auxiliary features, capturing nonlinear interactions between side information and topic distributions. Uses stochastic variational Expectation-Maximization for joint optimization.

Result: Across multiple benchmark datasets, nnLDA consistently outperforms LDA and Dirichlet-Multinomial Regression in topic coherence, perplexity, and downstream classification.

Conclusion: Combining neural representation learning with probabilistic topic modeling provides significant benefits when side information is available.

Abstract: Traditional topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) have been
widely used to uncover latent structures in text corpora, but they often
struggle to integrate auxiliary information such as metadata, user attributes,
or document labels. These limitations restrict their expressiveness,
personalization, and interpretability. To address this, we propose nnLDA, a
neural-augmented probabilistic topic model that dynamically incorporates side
information through a neural prior mechanism. nnLDA models each document as a
mixture of latent topics, where the prior over topic proportions is generated
by a neural network conditioned on auxiliary features. This design allows the
model to capture complex nonlinear interactions between side information and
topic distributions that static Dirichlet priors cannot represent. We develop a
stochastic variational Expectation-Maximization algorithm to jointly optimize
the neural and probabilistic components. Across multiple benchmark datasets,
nnLDA consistently outperforms LDA and Dirichlet-Multinomial Regression in
topic coherence, perplexity, and downstream classification. These results
highlight the benefits of combining neural representation learning with
probabilistic topic modeling in settings where side information is available.

*Zesheng Liu,YoungHyun Koo,Maryam Rahnemoonfar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KAN-GCN is a fast ice sheet modeling emulator that combines Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with Graph Convolution Networks, achieving better accuracy and efficiency than pure GCN and MLP-GCN baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the performance of emulators for numerical ice sheet models by developing a more efficient architecture that enhances feature conditioning and nonlinear encoding without increasing computational depth.

Method: Places a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) as a feature-wise calibrator before graph convolution networks (GCNs), applying learnable one-dimensional warps and linear mixing to improve feature conditioning. Replaces one edge-wise message-passing layer with a node-wise transform for efficiency.

Result: KAN-GCN matches or exceeds the accuracy of pure GCN and MLP-GCN baselines across 2- to 5-layer architectures. Improves inference throughput on coarser meshes with only a modest cost on the finest mesh. Achieved using 36 melting-rate simulations with 3 mesh-size settings for Pine Island Glacier, Antarctica.

Conclusion: KAN-first designs offer a favorable accuracy vs. efficiency trade-off for large transient scenario sweeps in ice sheet modeling, providing improved performance with minimal parameter overhead.

Abstract: We introduce KAN-GCN, a fast and accurate emulator for ice sheet modeling
that places a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) as a feature-wise calibrator
before graph convolution networks (GCNs). The KAN front end applies learnable
one-dimensional warps and a linear mixing step, improving feature conditioning
and nonlinear encoding without increasing message-passing depth. We employ this
architecture to improve the performance of emulators for numerical ice sheet
models. Our emulator is trained and tested using 36 melting-rate simulations
with 3 mesh-size settings for Pine Island Glacier, Antarctica. Across 2- to
5-layer architectures, KAN-GCN matches or exceeds the accuracy of pure GCN and
MLP-GCN baselines. Despite a small parameter overhead, KAN-GCN improves
inference throughput on coarser meshes by replacing one edge-wise
message-passing layer with a node-wise transform; only the finest mesh shows a
modest cost. Overall, KAN-first designs offer a favorable accuracy vs.
efficiency trade-off for large transient scenario sweeps.

### [73] [Can Aha Moments Be Fake? Identifying True and Decorative Thinking Steps in Chain-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24941)
*Jiachen Zhao,Yiyou Sun,Weiyan Shi,Dawn Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs often generate decorative Chain-of-Thought steps that don't actually contribute to predictions, with only 2.3% of steps having significant causal influence. Researchers developed True Thinking Score to measure step-wise impact and identified a TrueThinking direction that can control which steps are actually used.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether reasoning steps in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) truly reflect LLMs' internal thinking processes, as these steps are often assumed to faithfully monitor unsafe intentions but may not genuinely contribute to predictions.

Method: Proposed True Thinking Score (TTS) to measure causal influence of each reasoning step on final predictions, analyzed step-wise contributions, and identified a TrueThinking direction in latent space that can steer model behavior.

Result: Found LLMs interleave true-thinking steps (genuinely used) with decorative-thinking steps (minimal causal impact). Only 2.3% of CoT steps had TTS >= 0.7. Steering along TrueThinking direction can force internal reasoning over decorative steps, changing final results.

Conclusion: LLMs often verbalize reasoning steps without actually performing them internally, undermining both the efficiency of LLM reasoning and the trustworthiness of CoT as a faithful reflection of model thinking.

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) can generate long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
at test time, enabling them to solve complex tasks. These reasoning steps in
CoT are often assumed as a faithful reflection of the model's internal thinking
process, and used to monitor unsafe intentions. However, we find many reasoning
steps don't truly contribute to LLMs' prediction. We measure the step-wise
causal influence of each reasoning step on the model's final prediction with a
proposed True Thinking Score (TTS). We reveal that LLMs often interleave
between true-thinking steps (which are genuinely used to produce the final
output) and decorative-thinking steps (which only give the appearance of
reasoning but have minimal causal impact). Notably, only a small subset of the
total reasoning steps have a high TTS that causally drive the model's
prediction: e.g., for the AIME dataset, only an average of 2.3% of reasoning
steps in CoT have a TTS >= 0.7 (range: 0-1) under the Qwen-2.5 model.
Furthermore, we identify a TrueThinking direction in the latent space of LLMs.
By steering along or against this direction, we can force the model to perform
or disregard certain CoT steps when computing the final result. Finally, we
highlight that self-verification steps in CoT (i.e., aha moments) can also be
decorative, where LLMs do not truly verify their solution. Steering along the
TrueThinking direction can force internal reasoning over these steps, resulting
in a change in the final results. Overall, our work reveals that LLMs often
verbalize reasoning steps without actually performing them internally, which
undermines both the efficiency of LLM reasoning and the trustworthiness of CoT.

*Xiutian Zhao,Rochelle Choenni,Rohit Saxena,Ivan Titov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates culture-sensitive neurons in vision-language models (VLMs) that show preferential sensitivity to culturally grounded inputs, and demonstrates their importance for culturally diverse visual question answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite strong performance, VLMs struggle with culturally situated inputs. The authors aim to understand how VLMs process culturally grounded information by studying culture-sensitive neurons.

Method: Using the CVQA benchmark, the authors identify culture-selective neurons and perform causal tests by deactivating neurons flagged by different identification methods. They propose Contrastive Activation Selection (CAS) and compare it with existing probability- and entropy-based methods across three VLMs and 25 cultural groups.

Result: Experiments show that ablating culture-sensitive neurons disproportionately harms performance on questions about corresponding cultures while minimally affecting others. CAS outperforms existing methods in identifying these neurons, and layer-wise analysis reveals they cluster in certain decoder layers.

Conclusion: The findings reveal the existence and importance of culture-sensitive neurons in VLMs, providing new insights into the internal organization of multimodal representations.

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance, vision-language models (VLMs) still
struggle on culturally situated inputs. To understand how VLMs process
culturally grounded information, we study the presence of culture-sensitive
neurons, i.e. neurons whose activations show preferential sensitivity to inputs
associated with particular cultural contexts. We examine whether such neurons
are important for culturally diverse visual question answering and where they
are located. Using the CVQA benchmark, we identify neurons of culture
selectivity and perform causal tests by deactivating the neurons flagged by
different identification methods. Experiments on three VLMs across 25 cultural
groups demonstrate the existence of neurons whose ablation disproportionately
harms performance on questions about the corresponding cultures, while having
minimal effects on others. Moreover, we propose a new margin-based selector -
Contrastive Activation Selection (CAS), and show that it outperforms existing
probability- and entropy-based methods in identifying culture-sensitive
neurons. Finally, our layer-wise analyses reveals that such neurons tend to
cluster in certain decoder layers. Overall, our findings shed new light on the
internal organization of multimodal representations.

*Bernhard Klein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a co-design approach combining algorithmic and hardware optimizations to improve efficiency and robustness in both conventional and Bayesian neural networks, addressing computational demands and uncertainty quantification challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing computational demands of machine learning constrain scalability on resource-limited platforms, while neural networks need reliable predictions under distributional shifts. Bayesian neural networks provide uncertainty quantification but add computational overhead.

Method: Joint algorithmic and hardware optimization: algorithmic efficiency through model compression and approximate Bayesian inference; hardware efficiency via digital accelerators and analog hardware exploration. Specific methods include Galen for automatic layer-specific compression, noisy training for analog device robustness, probabilistic inference approximations, and probabilistic photonic computing.

Result: The work demonstrates improved resource efficiency and robustness through: automatic compression guided by sensitivity analysis, enhanced robustness to analog noise, efficient probabilistic inference replacing costly sampling, and energy-efficient probabilistic inference directly in hardware using photonic computing.

Conclusion: Efficiency and reliability can be advanced jointly through algorithm-hardware co-design, establishing foundations for next-generation trustworthy and energy-efficient machine learning systems.

Abstract: While modern machine learning has transformed numerous application domains,
its growing computational demands increasingly constrain scalability and
efficiency, particularly on embedded and resource-limited platforms. In
practice, neural networks must not only operate efficiently but also provide
reliable predictions under distributional shifts or unseen data. Bayesian
neural networks offer a principled framework for quantifying uncertainty, yet
their computational overhead further compounds these challenges.
  This work advances resource-efficient and robust inference for both
conventional and Bayesian neural networks through the joint pursuit of
algorithmic and hardware efficiency. The former reduces computation through
model compression and approximate Bayesian inference, while the latter
optimizes deployment on digital accelerators and explores analog hardware,
bridging algorithmic design and physical realization. The first contribution,
Galen, performs automatic layer-specific compression guided by sensitivity
analysis and hardware-in-the-loop feedback. Analog accelerators offer
efficiency gains at the cost of noise; this work models device imperfections
and extends noisy training to nonstationary conditions, improving robustness
and stability. A second line of work advances probabilistic inference,
developing analytic and ensemble approximations that replace costly sampling,
integrate into a compiler stack, and optimize embedded inference. Finally,
probabilistic photonic computing introduces a paradigm where controlled analog
noise acts as an intrinsic entropy source, enabling fast, energy-efficient
probabilistic inference directly in hardware.
  Together, these studies demonstrate how efficiency and reliability can be
advanced jointly through algorithm-hardware co-design, laying the foundation
for the next generation of trustworthy, energy-efficient machine-learning
systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies the low-dimensional structure of large language models by analyzing their low-rank properties, showing that model logits matrices have low approximate rank, and demonstrating how this structure enables generation using linear combinations of outputs from unrelated prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the inherent low-dimensional structure of large language models and develop a model-agnostic approach to study them as sequential probabilistic models.

Method: Empirical demonstration of low-rank structure in language model logits matrices, theoretical analysis of approximate rank properties, and practical generation experiments using linear combinations of outputs from unrelated prompts.

Result: Found that modern language models exhibit low-rank structure, and this structure can be leveraged for generation - responses to target prompts can be generated using linear combinations of outputs from unrelated or nonsensical prompts.

Conclusion: Language models have inherent low-dimensional structure characterized by low-rank properties, which provides a universal abstraction for theoretical analysis and enables practical applications in generation through linear combinations of model outputs.

Abstract: A major problem in the study of large language models is to understand their
inherent low-dimensional structure. We introduce an approach to study the
low-dimensional structure of language models at a model-agnostic level: as
sequential probabilistic models. We first empirically demonstrate that a wide
range of modern language models exhibit low-rank structure: in particular,
matrices built from the model's logits for varying sets of prompts and
responses have low approximate rank. We then show that this low-rank structure
can be leveraged for generation -- in particular, we can generate a response to
a target prompt using a linear combination of the model's outputs on unrelated,
or even nonsensical prompts.
  On the theoretical front, we observe that studying the approximate rank of
language models in the sense discussed above yields a simple universal
abstraction whose theoretical predictions parallel our experiments. We then
analyze the representation power of the abstraction and give provable learning
guarantees.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a rank-conditioned committee (RCC) framework for MLDE that separates conformational uncertainty from epistemic uncertainty by assigning different neural network committees to different conformational ranks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLDE approaches for antibody optimization often use single conformations or single committees across all conformations, which fails to properly distinguish between conformational uncertainty (uncertainty about the correct structure) and epistemic uncertainty (model uncertainty).

Method: Proposed a rank-conditioned committee (RCC) framework that uses ranked conformations to assign separate deep neural network committees for each conformational rank, enabling principled separation of uncertainty types.

Result: Validated on SARS-CoV-2 antibody docking, showing significant improvements over baseline strategies in modeling conformational uncertainty and antibody fitness prediction.

Conclusion: The RCC framework provides a scalable approach for therapeutic antibody discovery that directly addresses the challenge of conformational uncertainty modeling in structure-aware MLDE pipelines.

Abstract: Machine Learning-assisted directed evolution (MLDE) is a powerful tool for
efficiently navigating antibody fitness landscapes. Many structure-aware MLDE
pipelines rely on a single conformation or a single committee across all
conformations, limiting their ability to separate conformational uncertainty
from epistemic uncertainty. Here, we introduce a rank -conditioned committee
(RCC) framework that leverages ranked conformations to assign a deep neural
network committee per rank. This design enables a principled separation between
epistemic uncertainty and conformational uncertainty. We validate our approach
on SARS-CoV-2 antibody docking, demonstrating significant improvements over
baseline strategies. Our results offer a scalable route for therapeutic
antibody discovery while directly addressing the challenge of modeling
conformational uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exponential data growth increases computational costs in ML training, with many features not contributing to performance but consuming resources.

Method: Game-theoretic cooperative framework treating features as players, evaluating importance through synergistic interactions and marginal contributions, with four components: sample selection, feature importance evaluation, redundant feature elimination, and optimized training.

Result: Substantial computation reduction while preserving predictive performance, offering efficient solution for large-scale ML computational challenges.

Conclusion: The proposed game-theoretic feature selection framework effectively reduces computational costs while maintaining model performance, providing a practical solution for large-scale machine learning applications.

Abstract: The exponential growth of data volumes has led to escalating computational
costs in machine learning model training. However, many features fail to
contribute positively to model performance while consuming substantial
computational resources. This paper presents an end-to-end feature selection
framework for tabular data based on game theory. We formulate feature selection
procedure based on a cooperative game where features are modeled as players,
and their importance is determined through the evaluation of synergistic
interactions and marginal contributions. The proposed framework comprises four
core components: sample selection, game-theoretic feature importance
evaluation, redundant feature elimination, and optimized model training.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves substantial
computation reduction while preserving predictive performance, thereby offering
an efficient solution of the computational challenges of large-scale machine

*Ximan Sun,Xiang Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LRT-Diffusion introduces a risk-aware sampling method for diffusion policies in offline RL that treats denoising steps as sequential hypothesis tests, providing calibrated risk control without changing training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion policies for offline RL use heuristic guidance without statistical risk notions, lacking interpretable risk budgets and proper risk control mechanisms.

Method: Uses log-likelihood ratio tests at each denoising step, gating conditional means with calibrated logistic controllers. Training remains vanilla DDPM with two heads, while inference adds LRT guidance that can be combined with Q-gradients.

Result: On D4RL MuJoCo tasks, LRT-Diffusion improves return-OOD trade-off over Q-guided baselines while maintaining desired Type-I error rates, especially when off-support errors dominate.

Conclusion: LRT-Diffusion provides a drop-in, inference-time method that adds principled, calibrated risk control to diffusion policies for offline RL with theoretical guarantees on calibration and stability.

Abstract: Diffusion policies are competitive for offline reinforcement learning (RL)
but are typically guided at sampling time by heuristics that lack a statistical
notion of risk. We introduce LRT-Diffusion, a risk-aware sampling rule that
treats each denoising step as a sequential hypothesis test between the
unconditional prior and the state-conditional policy head. Concretely, we
accumulate a log-likelihood ratio and gate the conditional mean with a logistic
controller whose threshold tau is calibrated once under H0 to meet a
user-specified Type-I level alpha. This turns guidance from a fixed push into
an evidence-driven adjustment with a user-interpretable risk budget.
Importantly, we deliberately leave training vanilla (two heads with standard
epsilon-prediction) under the structure of DDPM. LRT guidance composes
naturally with Q-gradients: critic-gradient updates can be taken at the
unconditional mean, at the LRT-gated mean, or a blend, exposing a continuum
from exploitation to conservatism. We standardize states and actions
consistently at train and test time and report a state-conditional
out-of-distribution (OOD) metric alongside return. On D4RL MuJoCo tasks,
LRT-Diffusion improves the return-OOD trade-off over strong Q-guided baselines
in our implementation while honoring the desired alpha. Theoretically, we
establish level-alpha calibration, concise stability bounds, and a return
comparison showing when LRT surpasses Q-guidance-especially when off-support
errors dominate. Overall, LRT-Diffusion is a drop-in, inference-time method
that adds principled, calibrated risk control to diffusion policies for offline
RL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a machine learning approach that integrates both real-time seizure detection and prediction using EEG data, evaluated on the CHB-MIT database. The study shows Logistic Regression achieved 90.9% detection accuracy with 89.6% recall, while LSTM networks achieved 89.26% prediction accuracy, enabling proactive seizure management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional seizure detection approaches only identify seizures after they begin, limiting opportunities for early intervention. The authors aim to develop a system that can both detect and predict seizures to enable proactive treatment and reduce injury risks.

Method: Used the CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database with 969 hours of recordings and 173 seizures from 23 patients. For detection: implemented K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. For prediction: employed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to model temporal dependencies in EEG data.

Result: Logistic Regression achieved 90.9% detection accuracy with 89.6% recall. Random Forest and SVM achieved 94.0% accuracy but 0% recall. LSTM model achieved 89.26% prediction accuracy for seizure forecasting.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential for developing accessible, real-time monitoring tools that shift from reactive to proactive seizure management, allowing patients to anticipate seizures and take precautionary measures.

Abstract: In recent years, machine learning has become an increasingly powerful tool
for supporting seizure detection and monitoring in epilepsy care. Traditional
approaches focus on identifying seizures only after they begin, which limits
the opportunity for early intervention and proactive treatment. In this study,
we propose a novel approach that integrates both real-time seizure detection
and prediction, aiming to capture subtle temporal patterns in EEG data that may
indicate an upcoming seizure. Our approach was evaluated using the CHB-MIT
Scalp EEG Database, which includes 969 hours of recordings and 173 seizures
collected from 23 pediatric and young adult patients with drug-resistant
epilepsy. To support seizure detection, we implemented a range of supervised
machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic
Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. The Logistic Regression
achieved 90.9% detection accuracy with 89.6% recall, demonstrating balanced
performance suitable for clinical screening. Random Forest and Support Vector
Machine models achieved higher accuracy (94.0%) but with 0% recall, failing to
detect any seizures, illustrating that accuracy alone is insufficient for
evaluating medical ML models with class imbalance. For seizure prediction, we
employed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which use deep learning to
model temporal dependencies in EEG data. The LSTM model achieved 89.26%
prediction accuracy. These results highlight the potential of developing
accessible, real-time monitoring tools that not only detect seizures as
traditionally done, but also predict them before they occur. This ability to
predict seizures marks a significant shift from reactive seizure management to
a more proactive approach, allowing patients to anticipate seizures and take
precautionary measures to reduce the risk of injury or other complications.

*Hemanath Arumugam,Falong Fan,Bo Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel HRL architecture that integrates self-supervised Transformer-based Change Point Detection into the Option-Critic framework to autonomously discover meaningful subgoals and learn optimal option termination boundaries, leading to more interpretable and efficient hierarchical policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning faces practical challenges in autonomously discovering semantically meaningful subgoals and learning optimal option termination boundaries, despite its theoretical appeal for long-horizon tasks.

Method: Integrates a self-supervised Transformer-based Change Point Detection module into Option-Critic framework, using heuristic pseudo-labels from intrinsic signals to detect latent shifts in environment dynamics. Uses change-points for: (i) stabilizing termination function gradients, (ii) pretraining intra-option policies via behavioral cloning, and (iii) enforcing functional specialization through inter-option divergence penalties.

Result: Experiments on Four-Rooms and Pinball tasks show CPD-guided agents exhibit accelerated convergence, higher cumulative returns, and significantly improved option specialization compared to standard approaches.

Conclusion: Integrating structural priors via change-point segmentation leads to more interpretable, sample-efficient, and robust hierarchical policies in complex environments, enabling autonomous discovery of reusable, semantically meaningful skills.

Abstract: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) enhances the scalability of
decision-making in long-horizon tasks by introducing temporal abstraction
through options-policies that span multiple timesteps. Despite its theoretical
appeal, the practical implementation of HRL suffers from the challenge of
autonomously discovering semantically meaningful subgoals and learning optimal
option termination boundaries. This paper introduces a novel architecture that
integrates a self-supervised, Transformer-based Change Point Detection (CPD)
module into the Option-Critic framework, enabling adaptive segmentation of
state trajectories and the discovery of options. The CPD module is trained
using heuristic pseudo-labels derived from intrinsic signals to infer latent
shifts in environment dynamics without external supervision. These inferred
change-points are leveraged in three critical ways: (i) to serve as supervisory
signals for stabilizing termination function gradients, (ii) to pretrain
intra-option policies via segment-wise behavioral cloning, and (iii) to enforce
functional specialization through inter-option divergence penalties over
CPD-defined state partitions. The overall optimization objective enhances the
standard actor-critic loss using structure-aware auxiliary losses. In our
framework, option discovery arises naturally as CPD-defined trajectory segments
are mapped to distinct intra-option policies, enabling the agent to
autonomously partition its behavior into reusable, semantically meaningful
skills. Experiments on the Four-Rooms and Pinball tasks demonstrate that
CPD-guided agents exhibit accelerated convergence, higher cumulative returns,
and significantly improved option specialization. These findings confirm that
integrating structural priors via change-point segmentation leads to more
interpretable, sample-efficient, and robust hierarchical policies in complex

### [82] [What Really Matters in Matrix-Whitening Optimizers?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25000)
*Kevin Frans,Pieter Abbeel,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Matrix-whitening optimizers outperform elementwise methods like Adam, with performance gains primarily driven by variance adaptation rather than just spectral normalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically analyze matrix-whitening optimizers and identify the key components that explain their superior performance compared to elementwise counterparts.

Method: Deconstruct various matrix-whitening optimizers through systematic analysis and experiments, comparing their components including spectral normalization and variance adaptation strategies.

Result: All matrix-whitening methods reliably outperform Adam across tuned hyperparameters. Performance gains are primarily explained by variance adaptation rather than accurate spectral normalization alone. Variance-adapted versions consistently outperform sign-descent counterparts.

Conclusion: Matrix-whitening serves dual purposes, with variance adaptation being the overlooked but crucial component driving performance gains. Low-rank variance estimators can effectively reduce memory costs without performance loss.

Abstract: A range of recent optimizers have emerged that approximate the same
"matrix-whitening" transformation in various ways. In this work, we
systematically deconstruct such optimizers, aiming to disentangle the key
components that explain performance. Across tuned hyperparameters across the
board, all flavors of matrix-whitening methods reliably outperform elementwise
counterparts, such as Adam. Matrix-whitening is often related to spectral
descent -- however, experiments reveal that performance gains are *not
explained solely by accurate spectral normalization* -- particularly, SOAP
displays the largest per-step gain, even though Muon more accurately descends
along the steepest spectral descent direction. Instead, we argue that
matrix-whitening serves two purposes, and the variance adaptation component of
matrix-whitening is the overlooked ingredient explaining this performance gap.
Experiments show that variance-adapted versions of optimizers consistently
outperform their sign-descent counterparts, including an adaptive version of
Muon. We further ablate variance adaptation strategies, finding that while
lookahead style approximations are not as effective, low-rank variance
estimators can effectively reduce memory costs without a performance loss.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPIRE is a deep multi-encoder autoencoder that disentangles shared network dynamics from region-specific activity in multi-region neural data, using novel alignment and disentanglement losses to separate recordings into shared and private latent subspaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of disentangling shared network-level dynamics from region-specific activity in multi-region neural data modeling.

Method: SPIRE uses a deep multi-encoder autoencoder with novel alignment and disentanglement losses to factorize recordings into shared and private latent subspaces, trained solely on baseline data.

Result: SPIRE robustly recovers cross-regional structure, reveals how external perturbations reorganize it, outperforms classical probabilistic models on synthetic benchmarks, and shows shared latents reliably encode stimulation-specific signatures in DBS recordings.

Conclusion: SPIRE is established as a practical, reproducible tool for analyzing multi-region neural dynamics under stimulation, with shared latents encoding stimulation-specific signatures that generalize across sites and frequencies.

Abstract: Disentangling shared network-level dynamics from region-specific activity is
a central challenge in modeling multi-region neural data. We introduce SPIRE
(Shared-Private Inter-Regional Encoder), a deep multi-encoder autoencoder that
factorizes recordings into shared and private latent subspaces with novel
alignment and disentanglement losses. Trained solely on baseline data, SPIRE
robustly recovers cross-regional structure and reveals how external
perturbations reorganize it. On synthetic benchmarks with ground-truth latents,
SPIRE outperforms classical probabilistic models under nonlinear distortions
and temporal misalignments. Applied to intracranial deep brain stimulation
(DBS) recordings, SPIRE shows that shared latents reliably encode
stimulation-specific signatures that generalize across sites and frequencies.
These results establish SPIRE as a practical, reproducible tool for analyzing
multi-region neural dynamics under stimulation.

*Sarmad Ahmad Khan,Simon Bernatz,Zahra Moslehi,Florian Buettner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study evaluates the robustness of radiomics-based machine learning models against distribution shifts from MRI protocol variations, segmentation differences, and inter-observer variability, finding that protocol-invariant features and dataset augmentation significantly improve model reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiomics-based ML models show clinical promise but are vulnerable to distribution shifts from imaging protocol variations, positioning differences, and segmentation inconsistencies, which can undermine their reliability in real-world applications.

Method: Using a phantom of 16 fruits, the study evaluated distribution shifts through: (1) protocol variations across five MRI sequences (T2-HASTE, T2-TSE, T2-MAP, T1-TSE, T2-FLAIR); (2) segmentation variations (full, partial, rotated); and (3) inter-observer variability. XGBoost classifiers were trained on 8 consistent robust features versus sequence-specific features.

Result: Models trained on protocol-invariant features maintained F1-scores >0.85 across distribution shifts, while models using all features showed 40% performance degradation under protocol changes. Dataset augmentation improved uncertainty estimates and reduced expected calibration error (ECE) by 35% without sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: Protocol-aware feature selection and controlled phantom studies effectively predict model behavior under distribution shifts, providing a framework for developing robust radiomics models resilient to real-world protocol variations.

Abstract: Radiomics-based machine learning models show promise for clinical decision
support but are vulnerable to distribution shifts caused by variations in
imaging protocols, positioning, and segmentation. This study systematically
investigates the robustness of radiomics-based machine learning models under
distribution shifts across five MRI sequences. We evaluated how different
acquisition protocols and segmentation strategies affect model reliability in
terms of predictive power and uncertainty-awareness. Using a phantom of 16
fruits, we evaluated distribution shifts through: (1) protocol variations
across T2-HASTE, T2-TSE, T2-MAP, T1-TSE, and T2-FLAIR sequences; (2)
segmentation variations (full, partial, rotated); and (3) inter-observer
variability. We trained XGBoost classifiers on 8 consistent robust features
versus sequence-specific features, testing model performance under in-domain
and out-of-domain conditions. Results demonstrate that models trained on
protocol-invariant features maintain F1-scores >0.85 across distribution
shifts, while models using all features showed 40% performance degradation
under protocol changes. Dataset augmentation substantially improved the quality
of uncertainty estimates and reduced the expected calibration error (ECE) by
35% without sacrificing accuracy. Temperature scaling provided minimal
calibration benefits, confirming XGBoost's inherent reliability. Our findings
reveal that protocol-aware feature selection and controlled phantom studies
effectively predict model behavior under distribution shifts, providing a
framework for developing robust radiomics models resilient to real-world
protocol variations.

*Zhufeng Li,Niki Kilbertus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new graph distance measure for causal discovery evaluation that focuses on how graph differences affect cause-effect estimation under unobserved confounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for evaluating causal discovery methods are inadequate, especially when dealing with latent confounding. There's a need for better evaluation metrics that reflect practical performance in causal inference tasks.

Method: The approach uses identification via fixing and a symbolic verifier to quantify how differences between graphs distort cause-effect estimands for various treatment-outcome pairs in acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs).

Result: The proposed measure is analyzed under different graph perturbations and compared against existing distance metrics, showing its behavior and advantages.

Conclusion: This new graph distance measure provides a more meaningful evaluation framework for causal discovery methods by focusing on practical implications for cause-effect estimation under confounding.

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to recover graphs that represent causal relations among
given variables from observations, and new methods are constantly being
proposed. Increasingly, the community raises questions about how much progress
is made, because properly evaluating discovered graphs remains notoriously
difficult, particularly under latent confounding. We propose a graph distance
measure for acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) based on the downstream task
of cause-effect estimation under unobserved confounding. Our approach uses
identification via fixing and a symbolic verifier to quantify how graph
differences distort cause-effect estimands for different treatment-outcome
pairs. We analyze the behavior of the measure under different graph
perturbations and compare it against existing distance metrics.

*Zhifeng Wang,Longlong Li,Chunyan Zeng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DWMGrad is a novel optimization algorithm that addresses limitations of SGD and Adam by using dynamic guidance based on historical data to adapt momentum and learning rates, achieving faster convergence and higher accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current optimization algorithms like SGD and Adam struggle with learning efficiency fluctuations, complex models, and non-convex optimization due to issues like learning rate selection, local optima avoidance, and high-dimensional navigation.

Method: DWMGrad builds on traditional methods by incorporating a dynamic guidance mechanism that uses historical data to dynamically update momentum and learning rates, allowing flexible adjustment of reliance on historical information.

Result: Extensive experimentation shows DWMGrad achieves faster convergence rates and higher accuracies across multiple scenarios compared to existing optimization methods.

Conclusion: DWMGrad's dynamic guidance mechanism enables better adaptation to changing environments and task complexities, making it a superior optimization algorithm for deep learning applications.

Abstract: Within the current sphere of deep learning research, despite the extensive
application of optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent
(SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), there remains a pronounced
inadequacy in their capability to address fluctuations in learning efficiency,
meet the demands of complex models, and tackle non-convex optimization issues.
These challenges primarily arise from the algorithms' limitations in handling
complex data structures and models, for instance, difficulties in selecting an
appropriate learning rate, avoiding local optima, and navigating through
high-dimensional spaces. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel
optimization algorithm named DWMGrad. This algorithm, building on the
foundations of traditional methods, incorporates a dynamic guidance mechanism
reliant on historical data to dynamically update momentum and learning rates.
This allows the optimizer to flexibly adjust its reliance on historical
information, adapting to various training scenarios. This strategy not only
enables the optimizer to better adapt to changing environments and task
complexities but also, as validated through extensive experimentation,
demonstrates DWMGrad's ability to achieve faster convergence rates and higher
accuracies under a multitude of scenarios.

Motivation: To enable exploration of trainable architectures that integrate black-box functions, particularly for networks where computational graphs are inaccessible, allowing combination of analogue and digital devices for network scaling.

Method: Bounded Numerical Differentiation (BOND) - a perturbative method that estimates partial derivatives across network structures with inaccessible computational graphs, using fixed untrained networks as black-box functions.

Result: BOND shows improved accuracy and scalability over existing perturbative methods. Black-box functions (fixed untrained networks) enhance model performance without increasing trainable parameters, achieved without extensive optimization of architecture or black-box properties.

Conclusion: Fixed non-trainable modules can expand model capacity, suggesting a viable path for combining analogue and digital devices as a mechanism for scaling networks through black-box function integration.

Abstract: We introduce Bounded Numerical Differentiation (BOND), a perturbative method
for estimating partial derivatives across network structures with inaccessible

existing perturbative methods, enabling new explorations of trainable
architectures that integrate black-box functions. We observe that these
black-box functions, realized in our experiments as fixed, untrained networks,
can enhance model performance without increasing the number of trainable
parameters. This improvement is achieved without extensive optimization of the

TL;DR: PESO is a continual adaptation method for LoRA in recommendation that uses proximal regularization to balance adaptation and preservation, addressing the unique challenge that predicting past preferences can harm performance when user interests shift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA-based continual learning methods focus on preserving past performance, but in recommendation, predicting outdated preferences can actually harm performance when user interests evolve significantly over time.

Method: PESO introduces a proximal regularizer that anchors the current adapter to its most recent frozen state, enabling flexible balance between adaptation and preservation while capturing recent user behaviors.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows the proximal design provides data-aware, direction-wise guidance in the LoRA subspace. Empirically, PESO consistently outperforms existing LoRA-based continual learning methods.

Conclusion: PESO effectively addresses the unique challenges of continual learning in recommendation by enabling flexible adaptation to evolving user preferences while avoiding the pitfalls of preserving outdated preferences.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance in
recommendation, they face challenges in continual learning as users, items, and
user preferences evolve over time. Existing LoRA-based continual methods
primarily focus on preserving performance on previous tasks, but this overlooks
the unique nature of recommendation: the goal is not to predict past
preferences, and outdated preferences can even harm performance when current
interests shift significantly. To address this, we propose PESO (Proximally
rEgularized Single evolving lOra, a continual adaptation method for LoRA in
recommendation. PESO introduces a proximal regularizer that anchors the current
adapter to its most recent frozen state, enabling the model to flexibly balance
adaptation and preservation, and to better capture recent user behaviors.
Theoretically, we show that this proximal design provides data-aware,
direction-wise guidance in the LoRA subspace. Empirically, PESO consistently
outperforms existing LoRA-based continual learning methods.

*Chuxun Liu,Debo Cheng,Qingfeng Chen,Jiangzhang Gan,Jiuyong Li,Lin Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairMIB is a multi-view information bottleneck framework that decomposes graphs into feature, structural, and diffusion views to mitigate complexity biases in GNNs, achieving superior fairness-utility trade-offs through contrastive learning and IPW adjacency correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs can amplify training data biases by propagating discriminatory attributes and structural imbalances, leading to unfair outcomes. Existing fairness methods often treat bias as a single source, ignoring distinct attribute and structure effects, resulting in suboptimal fairness-utility trade-offs.

Method: FairMIB decomposes graphs into feature, structural, and diffusion views. It uses contrastive learning to maximize cross-view mutual information for bias-free representation learning, integrates multi-perspective conditional information bottleneck objectives to balance utility and fairness, and employs inverse probability-weighted adjacency correction in the diffusion view to reduce bias propagation during message passing.

Result: Experiments on five real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that FairMIB achieves state-of-the-art performance across both utility and fairness metrics.

Conclusion: FairMIB effectively addresses the limitations of single-source bias treatment in GNN fairness methods by providing a comprehensive multi-view framework that successfully balances task utility and fairness while mitigating bias propagation.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel on relational data by passing messages
over node features and structure, but they can amplify training data biases,
propagating discriminatory attributes and structural imbalances into unfair
outcomes. Many fairness methods treat bias as a single source, ignoring
distinct attribute and structure effects and leading to suboptimal fairness and
utility trade-offs. To overcome this challenge, we propose FairMIB, a
multi-view information bottleneck framework designed to decompose graphs into
feature, structural, and diffusion views for mitigating complexity biases in
GNNs. Especially, the proposed FairMIB employs contrastive learning to maximize
cross-view mutual information for bias-free representation learning. It further
integrates multi-perspective conditional information bottleneck objectives to
balance task utility and fairness by minimizing mutual information with
sensitive attributes. Additionally, FairMIB introduces an inverse
probability-weighted (IPW) adjacency correction in the diffusion view, which
reduces the spread of bias propagation during message passing. Experiments on
five real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that FairMIB achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both utility and fairness metrics.

*Marko Medvedev,Kaifeng Lyu,Zhiyuan Li,Nathan Srebro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Distribution shift between training and test data can be beneficial for performance, even when components are unrelated with no transfer learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the conventional assumption that distribution shift between training and test data is always detrimental, and to explore scenarios where mismatched training proportions can actually improve test performance.

Method: Analyze mixture distributions with different training and test proportions across various scenarios, examining optimal training proportions and the extent of potential benefits from distribution shift.

Result: Identified that distribution shift can be beneficial in many settings, determined optimal training proportions that maximize test performance, and showed the analysis applies to compositional settings with different distributions of component skills.

Conclusion: Distribution shift between training and test distributions is not inherently harmful and can actually improve performance in certain scenarios, with identifiable optimal training strategies.

Abstract: We consider training and testing on mixture distributions with different
training and test proportions. We show that in many settings, and in some sense
generically, distribution shift can be beneficial, and test performance can
improve due to mismatched training proportions, even if the components are
unrelated and with no transfer between components. In a variety of scenarios,
we identify the optimal training proportions and the extent to which such
distribution shift can be beneficial. We show how the same analysis applies
also to a compositional setting with differing distribution of component
"skills'' at training and test.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The Neural Differential Manifold (NDM) is a novel neural network architecture that incorporates geometric structure by modeling networks as differentiable manifolds with Riemannian metrics, organized into coordinate, geometric, and evolution layers for enhanced interpretability and regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond conventional Euclidean parameter spaces and explicitly incorporate geometric structure into neural network design, enabling more interpretable representations, intrinsic regularization, and geometrically-aligned optimization.

Method: Three-layer architecture: Coordinate Layer (smooth chart transitions via invertible transformations), Geometric Layer (dynamically generates Riemannian metric tensor), and Evolution Layer (dual-objective optimization balancing task performance and geometric simplicity).

Result: Theoretical analysis shows potential for more efficient optimization, enhanced generalization and robustness through geometric regularization, improved interpretability with geometrically meaningful representations, and applications in continual learning and scientific discovery.

Conclusion: NDM represents a fundamental shift toward geometrically structured deep learning systems, offering enhanced interpretability, regularization, and optimization efficiency, though computational challenges remain for practical implementation.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Neural Differential Manifold (NDM), a novel neural
network architecture that explicitly incorporates geometric structure into its
fundamental design. Departing from conventional Euclidean parameter spaces, the
NDM re-conceptualizes a neural network as a differentiable manifold where each
layer functions as a local coordinate chart, and the network parameters
directly parameterize a Riemannian metric tensor at every point. The
architecture is organized into three synergistic layers: a Coordinate Layer
implementing smooth chart transitions via invertible transformations inspired
by normalizing flows, a Geometric Layer that dynamically generates the
manifold's metric through auxiliary sub-networks, and an Evolution Layer that
optimizes both task performance and geometric simplicity through a
dual-objective loss function. This geometric regularization penalizes excessive
curvature and volume distortion, providing intrinsic regularization that
enhances generalization and robustness. The framework enables natural gradient
descent optimization aligned with the learned manifold geometry and offers
unprecedented interpretability by endowing internal representations with clear
geometric meaning. We analyze the theoretical advantages of this approach,
including its potential for more efficient optimization, enhanced continual
learning, and applications in scientific discovery and controllable generative
modeling. While significant computational challenges remain, the Neural
Differential Manifold represents a fundamental shift towards geometrically
structured, interpretable, and efficient deep learning systems.

*Yutong Zheng,Qingna Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified bilevel model for adversarial learning and investigates adversarial attacks in clustering models from a data perturbation perspective, revealing that clustering models are robust to small perturbations but vulnerable to larger ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the lack of clear understanding about how adversarial attacks work in machine learning models and the absence of effective methods to measure attack effects, particularly in clustering models.

Method: The authors propose a unified bilevel model for adversarial learning and analyze adversarial attacks in clustering models from a data perturbation viewpoint. They examine the well-definedness of the δ-measure for quantifying attack effects.

Result: The study reveals that clustering models remain robust when data perturbations are relatively small, but become vulnerable to attacks when perturbations are relatively large, causing clustering results to change.

Conclusion: The δ-measure is well-defined and can be effectively used in the proposed bilevel model to measure adversarial attack effects in clustering models, providing insights into the robustness-vulnerability threshold of clustering algorithms.

Abstract: Adversarial learning has been attracting more and more attention thanks to
the fast development of machine learning and artificial intelligence. However,
due to the complicated structure of most machine learning models, the mechanism
of adversarial attacks is not well interpreted. How to measure the effect of
attack is still not quite clear. In this paper, we propose a unified bilevel
model for adversarial learning. We further investigate the adversarial attack
in clustering models and interpret it from data perturbation point of view. We
reveal that when the data perturbation is relatively small, the clustering
model is robust, whereas if it is relatively large, the clustering result
changes, which leads to an attack. To measure the effect of attacks for
clustering models, we analyse the well-definedness of the so-called
$\delta$-measure, which can be used in the proposed bilevel model for
adversarial learning of clustering models.

TL;DR: A data-driven dimensionality reduction method using low rank neural representation (LRNR) for hyperbolic wave propagation data, achieving efficient compression and interpretable physical feature decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient dimensionality reduction method specifically for physics-based hyperbolic wave propagation data, motivated by theoretical proofs of efficient representations for this wave class.

Method: Utilizes a specialized neural network architecture called low rank neural representation (LRNR) within a hypernetwork framework, combining deep learning techniques to learn low-dimensional representations directly from data.

Result: The trained LRNRs naturally produce low rank tensor representations that reveal a new decomposition of wave propagation with interpretable physical features, and enable efficient inference via compression schemes.

Conclusion: The LRNR architecture successfully provides efficient low-dimensional representations for hyperbolic wave propagation, offering both interpretable physical insights and practical performance benefits through compression.

Abstract: We present a data-driven dimensionality reduction method that is well-suited
for physics-based data representing hyperbolic wave propagation. The method
utilizes a specialized neural network architecture called low rank neural
representation (LRNR) inside a hypernetwork framework. The architecture is
motivated by theoretical results that rigorously prove the existence of
efficient representations for this wave class. We illustrate through archetypal
examples that such an efficient low-dimensional representation of propagating
waves can be learned directly from data through a combination of deep learning
techniques. We observe that a low rank tensor representation arises naturally
in the trained LRNRs, and that this reveals a new decomposition of wave
propagation where each decomposed mode corresponds to interpretable physical
features. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LRNR architecture enables
efficient inference via a compression scheme, which is a potentially important
feature when deploying LRNRs in demanding performance regimes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BRIDGE is a unified architecture that jointly models sequential and relational data by coupling sequence encoders with graph neural networks, enabling token-level message passing between neighboring sequences for improved performance on tasks like friendship prediction and fraud detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many real-world datasets contain both sequential events at nodes and relational interactions between nodes. Existing methods typically focus on either sequences or graphs separately, but these modalities are complementary and should be learned jointly to capture the full complexity of such data.

Method: BRIDGE combines a sequence encoder with a graph neural network under a single end-to-end objective, allowing gradient flow across both modules. It introduces TOKENXATTN, a token-level cross-attention layer that enables fine-grained message passing between events in neighboring sequences.

Result: BRIDGE consistently outperforms static GNNs, temporal graph methods, and sequence-only baselines on ranking and classification metrics across two settings: friendship prediction (Brightkite dataset) and fraud detection (Amazon dataset).

Conclusion: Sequences and graphs are complementary facets of relational sequential data that should be modeled jointly. The BRIDGE architecture successfully integrates both modalities through coupled learning and token-level cross-attention, demonstrating superior performance over methods that treat sequences and graphs separately.

Abstract: Many real-world datasets are both sequential and relational: each node
carries an event sequence while edges encode interactions. Existing methods in
sequence modeling and graph modeling often neglect one modality or the other.
We argue that sequences and graphs are not separate problems but complementary
facets of the same dataset, and should be learned jointly. We introduce BRIDGE,
a unified end-to-end architecture that couples a sequence encoder with a GNN
under a single objective, allowing gradients to flow across both modules and
learning task-aligned representations. To enable fine-grained token-level
message passing among neighbors, we add TOKENXATTN, a token-level
cross-attention layer that passes messages between events in neighboring
sequences. Across two settings, friendship prediction (Brightkite) and fraud
detection (Amazon), BRIDGE consistently outperforms static GNNs, temporal graph
methods, and sequence-only baselines on ranking and classification metrics.

*Uzair Akbar,Niki Kilbertus,Hao Shen,Krikamol Muandet,Bo Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes using data augmentation as a form of instrumental variable to improve causal effect estimation and generalization across interventions, particularly when dealing with hidden confounders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional data augmentation is used for regularization in i.i.d. settings, but the authors want to extend its use to causal inference settings where instrumental variables may not be readily available.

Method: The authors introduce IV-like (IVL) regression by regularizing IV-based estimators, and cast parameterized data augmentation as an IVL regression problem that can simulate worst-case DA applications.

Result: The approach improves performance on causal estimation and generalization tasks beyond simple data augmentation, demonstrated theoretically for population cases and via simulations for finite samples.

Conclusion: Data augmentation can be effectively used as a substitute for instrumental variables in causal inference settings, helping mitigate confounding bias and improve generalization across interventions when proper IVs are unavailable.

Abstract: The technique of data augmentation (DA) is often used in machine learning for
regularization purposes to better generalize under i.i.d. settings. In this
work, we present a unifying framework with topics in causal inference to make a
case for the use of DA beyond just the i.i.d. setting, but for generalization
across interventions as well. Specifically, we argue that when the outcome
generating mechanism is invariant to our choice of DA, then such augmentations
can effectively be thought of as interventions on the treatment generating
mechanism itself. This can potentially help to reduce bias in causal effect
estimation arising from hidden confounders. In the presence of such unobserved
confounding we typically make use of instrumental variables (IVs) -- sources of
treatment randomization that are conditionally independent of the outcome.
However, IVs may not be as readily available as DA for many applications, which
is the main motivation behind this work. By appropriately regularizing IV based
estimators, we introduce the concept of IV-like (IVL) regression for mitigating
confounding bias and improving predictive performance across interventions even
when certain IV properties are relaxed. Finally, we cast parameterized DA as an
IVL regression problem and show that when used in composition can simulate a
worst-case application of such DA, further improving performance on causal
estimation and generalization tasks beyond what simple DA may offer. This is
shown both theoretically for the population case and via simulation experiments
for the finite sample case using a simple linear example. We also present real
data experiments to support our case.

### [96] [Lipschitz-aware Linearity Grafting for Certified Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25130)
*Yongjin Han,Suhyun Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how linearity grafting into non-linear activation functions improves certified robustness by reducing approximation errors and tightening local Lipschitz constants, rather than just reducing unstable neurons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for certified robustness face challenges with approximation errors in neural network verification, which hinder obtaining tight local Lipschitz constants crucial for robustness guarantees.

Method: Proposes a Lipschitz-aware linearity grafting method that grafts linearity into non-linear activation functions to eliminate approximation errors, since linear functions don't require relaxation.

Result: Extensive experiments show that grafting linearity into influential activations tightens the l∞ local Lipschitz constant and enhances certified robustness, even without certified training.

Conclusion: Linearity grafting improves certified robustness primarily by eliminating approximation errors rather than reducing unstable neurons, providing tighter local Lipschitz constants for better adversarial robustness guarantees.

Abstract: Lipschitz constant is a fundamental property in certified robustness, as
smaller values imply robustness to adversarial examples when a model is
confident in its prediction. However, identifying the worst-case adversarial
examples is known to be an NP-complete problem. Although over-approximation
methods have shown success in neural network verification to address this
challenge, reducing approximation errors remains a significant obstacle.
Furthermore, these approximation errors hinder the ability to obtain tight
local Lipschitz constants, which are crucial for certified robustness.
Originally, grafting linearity into non-linear activation functions was
proposed to reduce the number of unstable neurons, enabling scalable and
complete verification. However, no prior theoretical analysis has explained how
linearity grafting improves certified robustness. We instead consider linearity
grafting primarily as a means of eliminating approximation errors rather than
reducing the number of unstable neurons, since linear functions do not require
relaxation. In this paper, we provide two theoretical contributions: 1) why
linearity grafting improves certified robustness through the lens of the
$l_\infty$ local Lipschitz constant, and 2) grafting linearity into non-linear
activation functions, the dominant source of approximation errors, yields a
tighter local Lipschitz constant. Based on these theoretical contributions, we
propose a Lipschitz-aware linearity grafting method that removes dominant
approximation errors, which are crucial for tightening the local Lipschitz
constant, thereby improving certified robustness, even without certified
training. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that grafting linearity into
these influential activations tightens the $l_\infty$ local Lipschitz constant
and enhances certified robustness.

Method: Developed an ML-guided framework that extends existing ML-guided MILP solution methods while incorporating domain knowledge about energized and de-energized lines.

Result: The proposed method produces high-quality solutions faster than traditional optimization methods on a large-scale realistic California-based synthetic test system.

Conclusion: Machine learning can effectively accelerate the solution of Optimal Power Shutoff problems for wildfire risk management in power systems.

Abstract: To mitigate acute wildfire ignition risks, utilities de-energize power lines
in high-risk areas. The Optimal Power Shutoff (OPS) problem optimizes line
energization statuses to manage wildfire ignition risks through
de-energizations while reducing load shedding. OPS problems are computationally
challenging Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILPs) that must be solved rapidly
and frequently in operational settings. For a particular power system, OPS
instances share a common structure with varying parameters related to wildfire
risks, loads, and renewable generation. This motivates the use of Machine
Learning (ML) for solving OPS problems by exploiting shared patterns across
instances. In this paper, we develop an ML-guided framework that quickly
produces high-quality de-energization decisions by extending existing ML-guided
MILP solution methods while integrating domain knowledge on the number of
energized and de-energized lines. Results on a large-scale realistic
California-based synthetic test system show that the proposed ML-guided method
produces high-quality solutions faster than traditional optimization methods.

*Mohammadreza Doostmohammadian,Zulfiya R. Gabidullina,Hamid R. Rabiee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a co-optimization framework for distributed machine learning that simultaneously optimizes CPU resource allocation and local model training across computing nodes, achieving over 50% improvement in cost optimality compared to existing solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid evolution of AI research has increased demand for fast, computationally efficient, and scalable solutions for distributed machine learning and optimization problems.

Method: The approach formulates a co-optimization setup that assigns optimal CPU usage while training each computing node locally with its data share. It handles time-varying information-sharing networks with balanced weights, ensures all-time feasibility, and supports log-scale quantization over communication channels. Distributed SVM and regression are used as example applications.

Result: The proposed algorithm improves the cost optimality gap by more than 50% compared to existing CPU scheduling solutions. Convergence towards the optimal case is proven using perturbation theory, Lyapunov stability, and eigen-spectrum analysis.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the dual optimization of data processing and computing resource allocation in distributed ML systems, providing significant performance improvements while maintaining theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving research on artificial intelligence (AI) the demand
for fast, computationally efficient, and scalable solutions has increased in
recent years. The problem of optimizing the computing resources for distributed
machine learning (ML) and optimization is considered in this paper. Given a set
of data distributed over a network of computing-nodes/servers, the idea is to
optimally assign the CPU (central processing unit) usage while simultaneously
training each computing node locally via its own share of data. This formulates
the problem as a co-optimization setup to (i) optimize the data processing and
(ii) optimally allocate the computing resources. The information-sharing
network among the nodes might be time-varying, but with balanced weights to
ensure consensus-type convergence of the algorithm. The algorithm is all-time
feasible, which implies that the computing resource-demand balance constraint
holds at all iterations of the proposed solution. Moreover, the solution allows
addressing possible log-scale quantization over the information-sharing
channels to exchange log-quantized data. For some example applications,
distributed support-vector-machine (SVM) and regression are considered as the
ML training models. Results from perturbation theory, along with Lyapunov
stability and eigen-spectrum analysis, are used to prove the convergence
towards the optimal case. As compared to existing CPU scheduling solutions, the
proposed algorithm improves the cost optimality gap by more than $50\%$.

*Yisong Fu,Zezhi Shao,Chengqing Yu,Yujie Li,Zhulin An,Qi Wang,Yongjun Xu,Fei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A selective learning strategy for deep time series forecasting that screens timesteps using dual-mask mechanism to prevent overfitting by focusing on generalizable timesteps and ignoring uncertain/anomalous ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for time series forecasting suffer from severe overfitting due to vulnerability to noise and anomalies, as they uniformly optimize all timesteps through MSE loss without distinguishing between generalizable and non-generalizable timesteps.

Method: Proposes selective learning with dual-mask mechanism: (1) uncertainty mask using residual entropy to filter uncertain timesteps, (2) anomaly mask using residual lower bound estimation to exclude anomalous timesteps. Only screens a subset of timesteps for MSE loss calculation.

Result: Extensive experiments on 8 real-world datasets show significant performance improvements: 37.4% MSE reduction for Informer, 8.4% for TimesNet, and 6.5% for iTransformer compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: Selective learning strategy effectively addresses overfitting in deep time series forecasting by focusing optimization on generalizable timesteps while ignoring uncertain and anomalous ones, leading to substantial performance gains across various state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Benefiting from high capacity for capturing complex temporal patterns, deep
learning (DL) has significantly advanced time series forecasting (TSF).
However, deep models tend to suffer from severe overfitting due to the inherent
vulnerability of time series to noise and anomalies. The prevailing DL paradigm
uniformly optimizes all timesteps through the MSE loss and learns those
uncertain and anomalous timesteps without difference, ultimately resulting in
overfitting. To address this, we propose a novel selective learning strategy
for deep TSF. Specifically, selective learning screens a subset of the whole
timesteps to calculate the MSE loss in optimization, guiding the model to focus
on generalizable timesteps while disregarding non-generalizable ones. Our
framework introduces a dual-mask mechanism to target timesteps: (1) an
uncertainty mask leveraging residual entropy to filter uncertain timesteps, and
(2) an anomaly mask employing residual lower bound estimation to exclude
anomalous timesteps. Extensive experiments across eight real-world datasets
demonstrate that selective learning can significantly improve the predictive
performance for typical state-of-the-art deep models, including 37.4% MSE
reduction for Informer, 8.4% for TimesNet, and 6.5% for iTransformer.

*Miao Zhang,Junpeng Li,Changchun Hua,Yana Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A cost-sensitive multi-class PU learning method using adaptive loss weighting to achieve unbiased risk estimation when only positive and unlabeled data are available, outperforming existing approaches on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-class PU learning remains challenging as many existing approaches don't ensure unbiased risk estimation, limiting performance and stability in real-world applications where annotating reliable negatives is difficult or costly.

Method: Proposed a cost-sensitive multi-class PU method based on adaptive loss weighting within empirical risk minimization framework, assigning distinct data-dependent weights to positive and inferred-negative loss components to create an unbiased estimator of target risk.

Result: Extensive experiments on eight public datasets with varying class priors and numbers of classes showed consistent gains over strong baselines in both accuracy and stability.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive loss weighting approach effectively addresses the multi-class PU learning challenge by providing unbiased risk estimation and demonstrates superior performance across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Positive--Unlabeled (PU) learning considers settings in which only positive
and unlabeled data are available, while negatives are missing or left
unlabeled. This situation is common in real applications where annotating
reliable negatives is difficult or costly. Despite substantial progress in PU
learning, the multi-class case (MPU) remains challenging: many existing
approaches do not ensure \emph{unbiased risk estimation}, which limits
performance and stability. We propose a cost-sensitive multi-class PU method
based on \emph{adaptive loss weighting}. Within the empirical risk minimization
framework, we assign distinct, data-dependent weights to the positive and
\emph{inferred-negative} (from the unlabeled mixture) loss components so that
the resulting empirical objective is an unbiased estimator of the target risk.
We formalize the MPU data-generating process and establish a generalization
error bound for the proposed estimator. Extensive experiments on \textbf{eight}
public datasets, spanning varying class priors and numbers of classes, show
consistent gains over strong baselines in both accuracy and stability.

### [101] [BSFA: Leveraging the Subspace Dichotomy to Accelerate Neural Network Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25244)
*Wenjie Zhou,Bohan Wang,Wei Chen,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces BSFA, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates deep learning training by differentially scaling parameter updates in Dom-space (top eigendirections) and Bulk-space (orthogonal component), achieving 2x speedup on LLaMA models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent studies show that parameter updates in Dom-space contribute minimally to loss reduction despite large magnitudes, while Bulk-space updates with smaller magnitudes drive most learning progress. This motivates developing methods to leverage this dichotomy for faster training.

Method: BSFA framework with two key innovations: 1) Efficient PCA estimator using historical updates for fast subspace estimation, 2) Block-wise strategy applying estimation per parameter block. It scales Dom-space updates down for stability and amplifies Bulk-space updates for faster convergence.

Result: BSFA achieves approximately 2x speedup when pre-training LLaMA-72M on WikiText-103 and LLaMA-134M on OpenWebText compared to vanilla AdamW, demonstrating effectiveness across various tasks.

Conclusion: BSFA provides a practical and scalable solution to accelerate deep learning training by exploiting the fundamental dichotomy between Dom-space and Bulk-space updates, with innovations that make it computationally tractable for large models.

Abstract: Recent studies \citep{gur2018gradient,song2024does, wen2024understanding}
highlight a fundamental dichotomy in deep learning optimization: Although
parameter updates along the top eigendirections of the loss Hessian (Dom-space)
capture most of the update magnitude, they often contribute minimally to loss
reduction. In contrast, updates in the orthogonal component (Bulk-space) have
smaller magnitudes but drive most learning progress. In this work, we further
advance the understanding of this phenomenon and introduce the
\textbf{Bulk-Space-Filtration-Accelerator (BSFA)}, a novel plug-and-play
framework. BSFA accelerates training by differentially scaling update
components projected onto these distinct subspaces, simultaneously enhancing
stability by moderating updates in the dominant subspace and boosting
convergence speed by amplifying those in the bulk-space. To ensure BSFA is both
practical and scalable for contemporary large models, we introduce two key
innovations: an efficient estimator using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on
historical updates for fast subspace estimation, and a block-wise strategy that
applies this estimation on a per-parameter-block basis. These designs make BSFA
computationally tractable and highly effective. We demonstrate BSFA's
acceleration across various tasks, notably achieving approximately 2$\times$
speedup when pre-training LLaMA-72M on WikiText-103 and LLaMA-134M on
OpenWebText compared to vanilla AdamW.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Efficient Bayesian network structure sampling using optimized basic moves and parent set pruning for improved computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian network structure inference through Markov chain sampling is computationally expensive, particularly for basic operations like arc modifications and parent set summations.

Method: Two techniques: 1) Efficient implementation of basic moves (add, delete, reverse arcs), 2) Preprocessing method to prune possible parent sets while approximately preserving sums.

Result: Empirical study shows substantial efficiency gains compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques significantly improve the computational efficiency of Bayesian network structure sampling through optimized operations and approximate preservation methods.

Abstract: Bayesian inference of Bayesian network structures is often performed by
sampling directed acyclic graphs along an appropriately constructed Markov
chain. We present two techniques to improve sampling. First, we give an
efficient implementation of basic moves, which add, delete, or reverse a single
arc. Second, we expedite summing over parent sets, an expensive task required
for more sophisticated moves: we devise a preprocessing method to prune
possible parent sets so as to approximately preserve the sums. Our empirical
study shows that our techniques can yield substantial efficiency gains compared
to previous methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IBNorm is a new normalization method based on Information Bottleneck principle that outperforms traditional variance-centric methods like BatchNorm, LayerNorm, and RMSNorm by preserving predictive information while suppressing nuisance variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing normalization methods focus on variance control but don't optimize how representations capture task-relevant information. The authors aim to create normalization that better preserves predictive information.

Method: Proposed IB-Inspired Normalization (IBNorm) that introduces bounded compression operations grounded in Information Bottleneck principle to encourage embeddings to preserve predictive information while suppressing nuisance variability.

Result: IBNorm consistently outperforms BatchNorm, LayerNorm, and RMSNorm across large-scale language models (LLaMA, GPT-2) and vision models (ResNet, ViT), with mutual information analysis confirming superior information bottleneck behavior.

Conclusion: IBNorm provides a more effective normalization approach that yields more informative representations while maintaining the stability and compatibility of standard normalization methods.

Abstract: Normalization is fundamental to deep learning, but existing approaches such
as BatchNorm, LayerNorm, and RMSNorm are variance-centric by enforcing zero
mean and unit variance, stabilizing training without controlling how
representations capture task-relevant information. We propose IB-Inspired
Normalization (IBNorm), a simple yet powerful family of methods grounded in the
Information Bottleneck principle. IBNorm introduces bounded compression
operations that encourage embeddings to preserve predictive information while
suppressing nuisance variability, yielding more informative representations
while retaining the stability and compatibility of standard normalization.
Theoretically, we prove that IBNorm achieves a higher IB value and tighter
generalization bounds than variance-centric methods. Empirically, IBNorm
consistently outperforms BatchNorm, LayerNorm, and RMSNorm across large-scale
language models (LLaMA, GPT-2) and vision models (ResNet, ViT), with mutual
information analysis confirming superior information bottleneck behavior. Code
will be released publicly.

TL;DR: This thesis addresses neural network instability through sensitivity analysis, combining Lipschitz networks for input perturbation robustness, curvature regularization for smoother optimization landscapes, and randomized smoothing for decision boundary robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models suffer from instability and vulnerability to small input changes and sharp loss landscapes, which affect predictions and optimization.

Method: Uses Lipschitz networks to constrain input sensitivity, curvature regularization for parameter sensitivity, and randomized smoothing for probabilistic robustness at decision boundaries.

Result: Develops a unified framework with theoretical analysis and practical methodologies including efficient spectral norm computation, novel Lipschitz-constrained layers, and improved certification procedures.

Conclusion: Combining Lipschitz continuity, randomized smoothing, and curvature regularization provides a comprehensive approach to address fundamental stability challenges in neural networks.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success across a wide range of tasks,
but its models often suffer from instability and vulnerability: small changes
to the input may drastically affect predictions, while optimization can be
hindered by sharp loss landscapes. This thesis addresses these issues through
the unifying perspective of sensitivity analysis, which examines how neural
networks respond to perturbations at both the input and parameter levels.
  We study Lipschitz networks as a principled way to constrain sensitivity to
input perturbations, thereby improving generalization, adversarial robustness,
and training stability. To complement this architectural approach, we introduce
regularization techniques based on the curvature of the loss function,
promoting smoother optimization landscapes and reducing sensitivity to
parameter variations. Randomized smoothing is also explored as a probabilistic
method for enhancing robustness at decision boundaries.
  By combining these perspectives, we develop a unified framework where
Lipschitz continuity, randomized smoothing, and curvature regularization
interact to address fundamental challenges in stability. The thesis contributes
both theoretical analysis and practical methodologies, including efficient
spectral norm computation, novel Lipschitz-constrained layers, and improved
certification procedures.

*Xizhe Wang,Xiaobin Song,Qingshan Jia,Hongbo Zhao,Benben Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hierarchical physics-embedded learning framework for spatiotemporal dynamics that combines symbolic learning with neural operators to enable both forward prediction and inverse discovery of physical laws from sparse, noisy data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modeling complex spatiotemporal dynamics in far-from-equilibrium systems is challenging due to intractable PDEs with high-order derivatives and strong nonlinearities. Existing data-driven methods lack physical consistency or structural capacity to handle complex operators.

Method: Two-level architecture: first level learns fundamental symbolic PDE components, second level learns their governing combinations. Uses adaptive Fourier Neural Operators to capture non-local dependencies and high-order operators. Embeds known physical laws directly into computational graph.

Result: Enables physical consistency, improved data efficiency, and interpretable discovery of governing equations through symbolic regression without presupposing functional forms.

Conclusion: The hierarchical framework fundamentally advances both forward spatiotemporal prediction and inverse discovery of physical laws by structurally integrating prior knowledge and reducing learning complexity.

Abstract: Modeling complex spatiotemporal dynamics, particularly in
far-from-equilibrium systems, remains a grand challenge in science. The
governing partial differential equations (PDEs) for these systems are often
intractable to derive from first principles, due to their inherent complexity,
characterized by high-order derivatives and strong nonlinearities, coupled with
incomplete physical knowledge. This has spurred the development of data-driven
methods, yet these approaches face limitations: Purely data-driven models are
often physically inconsistent and data-intensive, while existing
physics-informed methods lack the structural capacity to represent complex
operators or systematically integrate partial physical knowledge. Here, we
propose a hierarchical physics-embedded learning framework that fundamentally
advances both the forward spatiotemporal prediction and inverse discovery of
physical laws from sparse and noisy data. The key innovation is a two-level
architecture that mirrors the process of scientific discovery: the first level
learns fundamental symbolic components of a PDE, while the second learns their
governing combinations. This hierarchical decomposition not only reduces
learning complexity but, more importantly, enables a structural integration of
prior knowledge. Known physical laws are directly embedded into the models
computational graph, guaranteeing physical consistency and improving data
efficiency. By building the framework upon adaptive Fourier Neural Operators,
we can effectively capture the non-local dependencies and high-order operators
characteristic of dynamical systems. Additionally, by structurally decoupling
known and unknown terms, the framework further enables interpretable discovery
of underlying governing equations through symbolic regression, without
presupposing functional forms.

*Sagalpreet Singh,Rishi Saket,Aravindan Raghuveer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Multi Goal RL algorithm that learns policies maximizing expected return while ensuring uniform visitation of goal states, addressing limitations of existing RL methods that may exploit few reward sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL algorithms focus on maximizing expected return but may exploit only a few reward sources, whereas many natural scenarios require dispersed visitation of rewarding states. Existing methods like entropy regularization don't guarantee dispersed marginal state distribution over goal states.

Method: Proposes a novel algorithm that learns a high-return policy mixture with dispersed marginal state distribution over goal states. Uses a custom RL reward computed based on current policy mixture and updates policies via offline RL on sampled trajectories.

Result: The algorithm provides performance guarantees with efficient convergence bounds for optimizing both expected return and dispersion of marginal state distribution over goal states. Experiments on synthetic MDPs and standard RL environments demonstrate effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed Multi Goal RL framework successfully addresses the challenge of learning policies that both maximize expected return and ensure uniform visitation of goal states, with theoretical guarantees and empirical validation.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning algorithms are primarily focused on learning a policy
that maximizes expected return. As a result, the learned policy can exploit one
or few reward sources. However, in many natural situations, it is desirable to
learn a policy that induces a dispersed marginal state distribution over
rewarding states, while maximizing the expected return which is typically tied
to reaching a goal state. This aspect remains relatively unexplored. Existing
techniques based on entropy regularization and intrinsic rewards use
stochasticity for encouraging exploration to find an optimal policy which may
not necessarily lead to dispersed marginal state distribution over rewarding
states. Other RL algorithms which match a target distribution assume the latter
to be available apriori. This may be infeasible in large scale systems where
enumeration of all states is not possible and a state is determined to be a
goal state only upon reaching it. We formalize the problem of maximizing the
expected return while uniformly visiting the goal states as Multi Goal RL in
which an oracle classifier over the state space determines the goal states. We
propose a novel algorithm that learns a high-return policy mixture with
marginal state distribution dispersed over the set of goal states. Our
algorithm is based on optimizing a custom RL reward which is computed - based
on the current policy mixture - at each iteration for a set of sampled
trajectories. The latter are used via an offline RL algorithm to update the
policy mixture. We prove performance guarantees for our algorithm, showing
efficient convergence bounds for optimizing a natural objective which captures
the expected return as well as the dispersion of the marginal state
distribution over the goal states. We design and perform experiments on
synthetic MDPs and standard RL environments to evaluate the effectiveness of
our algorithm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design linear layers for normalizing flows that enhance expressiveness while maintaining efficient computation of Jacobian determinant and inverse, overcoming the O(n²) parameter complexity limitation.

Method: Proposes a novel invertible linear layer based on product of circulant and diagonal matrices, leveraging Fast Fourier Transform for efficient computation of matrix inversion and log-determinant.

Result: Reduces parameter complexity from O(n²) to O(mn), matrix inversion from O(n³) to O(mn log n), and log-determinant computation from O(n³) to O(mn). Achieves strong density estimation on natural images and effective modeling of periodic data.

Conclusion: CDFlow provides an efficient and expressive linear layer for normalizing flows, significantly accelerating key operations while maintaining strong performance on various datasets.

Abstract: Normalizing flows are deep generative models that enable efficient likelihood
estimation and sampling through invertible transformations. A key challenge is
to design linear layers that enhance expressiveness while maintaining efficient
computation of the Jacobian determinant and inverse. We introduce a novel
invertible linear layer based on the product of circulant and diagonal
matrices. This decomposition reduces parameter complexity from
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$ using $m$ diagonal matrices and $m-1$
circulant matrices while still approximating general linear transformations. By
leveraging the Fast Fourier Transform, our approach reduces the time complexity
of matrix inversion from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn\log n)$ and that
of computing the log-determinant from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$,
where $n$ is the input dimension. We build upon this layer to develop
Circulant-Diagonal Flow (CDFlow), which achieves strong density estimation on
natural image datasets and effectively models data with inherent periodic
structure. Furthermore, CDFlow significantly accelerates key operations in
normalizing flows, providing practical benefits for scalable generative
modeling.

*Jie Peng,Rui Wang,Qiang Wang,Zhewei Wei,Bin Tong,Guan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses three key limitations in information cascade popularity prediction: temporal leakage in evaluation, feature-poor datasets, and computational inefficiency. The authors propose a time-ordered splitting strategy, introduce a large e-commerce dataset (Taoke), and develop a lightweight framework (CasTemp) that achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for information cascade popularity prediction suffer from three critical issues: temporal leakage in evaluation (models accessing future information), feature-poor datasets lacking conversion signals, and computational inefficiency of graph-based methods requiring days of training for minimal gains.

Method: The authors address these challenges through: (1) time-ordered splitting strategy that chronologically partitions data into consecutive windows to prevent future information leakage; (2) introduction of Taoke, a large-scale e-commerce cascade dataset with rich promoter/product attributes and purchase conversions; (3) development of CasTemp, a lightweight framework using temporal walks, Jaccard-based neighbor selection, and GRU-based encoding with time-aware attention.

Result: Under leak-free evaluation, CasTemp achieves state-of-the-art performance across four datasets with orders-of-magnitude speedup. It particularly excels at predicting second-stage popularity conversions, which is critical for practical real-world applications.

Conclusion: The proposed solutions systematically address the three key limitations in cascade popularity prediction through improved task setup, dataset construction, and model design. CasTemp demonstrates both superior performance and computational efficiency, making it suitable for practical applications requiring accurate prediction of conversion-based popularity.

Abstract: Information cascade popularity prediction is a key problem in analyzing
content diffusion in social networks. However, current related works suffer
from three critical limitations: (1) temporal leakage in current
evaluation--random cascade-based splits allow models to access future
information, yielding unrealistic results; (2) feature-poor datasets that lack
downstream conversion signals (e.g., likes, comments, or purchases), which
limits more practical applications; (3) computational inefficiency of complex
graph-based methods that require days of training for marginal gains. We
systematically address these challenges from three perspectives: task setup,
dataset construction, and model design. First, we propose a time-ordered
splitting strategy that chronologically partitions data into consecutive
windows, ensuring models are evaluated on genuine forecasting tasks without
future information leakage. Second, we introduce Taoke, a large-scale
e-commerce cascade dataset featuring rich promoter/product attributes and
ground-truth purchase conversions--capturing the complete diffusion lifecycle
from promotion to monetization. Third, we develop CasTemp, a lightweight
framework that efficiently models cascade dynamics through temporal walks,
Jaccard-based neighbor selection for inter-cascade dependencies, and GRU-based
encoding with time-aware attention. Under leak-free evaluation, CasTemp
achieves state-of-the-art performance across four datasets with
orders-of-magnitude speedup. Notably, it excels at predicting second-stage
popularity conversions--a practical task critical for real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hypergraphs naturally model higher-order interactions but lack theoretical foundations in semi-supervised learning, particularly for random geometric hypergraphs.

Method: Proposes Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL) which regularizes using powers of Laplacians from skeleton graphs to achieve multiscale smoothness.

Result: HOHL converges to a higher-order Sobolev seminorm and performs strongly on standard baselines in empirical evaluations.

Conclusion: The work establishes theoretical foundations for hypergraph learning and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed HOHL method through both theoretical analysis and empirical validation.

Abstract: Hypergraphs provide a natural framework for modeling higher-order
interactions, yet their theoretical underpinnings in semi-supervised learning
remain limited. We provide an asymptotic consistency analysis of variational
learning on random geometric hypergraphs, precisely characterizing the
conditions ensuring the well-posedness of hypergraph learning as well as
showing convergence to a weighted $p$-Laplacian equation. Motivated by this, we
propose Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL), which regularizes via powers
of Laplacians from skeleton graphs for multiscale smoothness. HOHL converges to
a higher-order Sobolev seminorm. Empirically, it performs strongly on standard
baselines.

*Rupesh Sapkota,Caglar Demir,Arnab Sharma,Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces model merging via weighted averaging for knowledge graph embedding models as an alternative to traditional ensemble methods, showing consistent performance improvements across link prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ensemble methods for knowledge graph embedding models require training multiple models, which increases computational overhead, latency, and memory usage. Model merging approaches offer a more efficient alternative without needing to train multiple models.

Method: The paper proposes two weighted averaging approaches: 1) maintaining a running average of model parameters from training epochs onward, and 2) selectively updating the running average only when generalization performance improves on validation data. These methods are evaluated on link prediction tasks, literal-augmented KGE models, and multi-hop query answering.

Result: The proposed weighted averaging approach consistently improves performance across diverse evaluation settings compared to state-of-the-art benchmark ensemble approaches.

Conclusion: Model merging through weighted averaging provides an effective and efficient alternative to traditional ensemble methods for knowledge graph embedding models, achieving better performance with reduced computational overhead.

Abstract: Ensemble methods are widely employed to improve generalization in machine
learning. This has also prompted the adoption of ensemble learning for the
knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models in performing link prediction. Typical
approaches to this end train multiple models as part of the ensemble, and the
diverse predictions are then averaged. However, this approach has some
significant drawbacks. For instance, the computational overhead of training
multiple models increases latency and memory overhead. In contrast, model
merging approaches offer a promising alternative that does not require training
multiple models. In this work, we introduce model merging, specifically
weighted averaging, in KGE models. Herein, a running average of model
parameters from a training epoch onward is maintained and used for predictions.
To address this, we additionally propose an approach that selectively updates
the running average of the ensemble model parameters only when the
generalization performance improves on a validation dataset. We evaluate these
two different weighted averaging approaches on link prediction tasks, comparing
the state-of-the-art benchmark ensemble approach. Additionally, we evaluate the
weighted averaging approach considering literal-augmented KGE models and
multi-hop query answering tasks as well. The results demonstrate that the
proposed weighted averaging approach consistently improves performance across
diverse evaluation settings.

*Tomas Hrycej,Bernhard Bermeitinger,Massimo Pavone,Götz-Henrik Wiegand,Siegfried Handschuh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-phase optimization algorithm that leverages the hypothesis that loss functions transition from non-convex to convex regions near the optimum, using Adam in non-convex regions and Conjugate Gradient in convex regions for improved convergence and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning optimization relies heavily on non-convex methods like Adam, but local minima imply convex regions where second-order methods like Conjugate Gradient can achieve superlinear convergence. The authors hypothesize that real-world loss functions transition from non-convex to convex regions near the optimum.

Method: A two-phase optimization framework that detects the transition point from non-convex to convex regions by observing gradient norm dependence on loss. Uses Adam in non-convex regions and switches to Conjugate Gradient in convex regions.

Result: Computing experiments confirm the hypothesis that this convexity structure is frequent enough to be practically exploited, leading to substantial improvements in convergence and accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed two-phase optimization algorithm successfully leverages the transition from non-convex to convex regions in loss functions, providing better convergence guarantees and improved performance compared to using only non-convex optimization methods.

Abstract: The key task of machine learning is to minimize the loss function that
measures the model fit to the training data. The numerical methods to do this
efficiently depend on the properties of the loss function. The most decisive
among these properties is the convexity or non-convexity of the loss function.
The fact that the loss function can have, and frequently has, non-convex
regions has led to a widespread commitment to non-convex methods such as Adam.
However, a local minimum implies that, in some environment around it, the
function is convex. In this environment, second-order minimizing methods such
as the Conjugate Gradient (CG) give a guaranteed superlinear convergence. We
propose a novel framework grounded in the hypothesis that loss functions in
real-world tasks swap from initial non-convexity to convexity towards the
optimum. This is a property we leverage to design an innovative two-phase
optimization algorithm. The presented algorithm detects the swap point by
observing the gradient norm dependence on the loss. In these regions,
non-convex (Adam) and convex (CG) algorithms are used, respectively. Computing
experiments confirm the hypothesis that this simple convexity structure is
frequent enough to be practically exploited to substantially improve
convergence and accuracy.

*Julien Martinelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Biology-Informed Machine Learning (BIML) as an extension of Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) to address unique challenges in biological modeling, including uncertain prior knowledge, noisy data, and complex networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To adapt PIML's success in physics to biology, which presents unique challenges like multi-faceted prior knowledge, heterogeneous data, partial observability, and high-dimensional networks that require different approaches.

Method: Proposes BIML as a principled extension of PIML that operates under softer, probabilistic forms of prior knowledge through four foundational pillars: uncertainty quantification, contextualization, constrained latent structure inference, and scalability.

Result: BIML provides a roadmap for transitioning PIML methods to biological applications, with Foundation Models and Large Language Models identified as key enablers for bridging human expertise with computational modeling.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with concrete recommendations to build the BIML ecosystem and direct PIML-inspired innovation toward scientifically and societally relevant biological challenges.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) has successfully integrated
mechanistic understanding into machine learning, particularly in domains
governed by well-known physical laws. This success has motivated efforts to
apply PIML to biology, a field rich in dynamical systems but shaped by
different constraints. Biological modeling, however, presents unique
challenges: multi-faceted and uncertain prior knowledge, heterogeneous and
noisy data, partial observability, and complex, high-dimensional networks. In
this position paper, we argue that these challenges should not be seen as
obstacles to PIML, but as catalysts for its evolution. We propose
Biology-Informed Machine Learning (BIML): a principled extension of PIML that
retains its structural grounding while adapting to the practical realities of
biology. Rather than replacing PIML, BIML retools its methods to operate under
softer, probabilistic forms of prior knowledge. We outline four foundational
pillars as a roadmap for this transition: uncertainty quantification,
contextualization, constrained latent structure inference, and scalability.
Foundation Models and Large Language Models will be key enablers, bridging
human expertise with computational modeling. We conclude with concrete
recommendations to build the BIML ecosystem and channel PIML-inspired
innovation toward challenges of high scientific and societal relevance.

*Adrien Weihs,Jingmin Sun,Zecheng Zhang,Hayden Schaeffer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies neural operator learning for approximating mappings between function spaces, distinguishing between multiple operator learning (single network representing continuum of operators) and learning several distinct operators. It introduces new architectures MNO and MONet with universal approximation guarantees and scaling laws, and provides empirical validation on PDE benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific applications require approximating mappings between function spaces (operators), but most machine learning focuses on finite-dimensional mappings. There's a need to learn collections of operators efficiently with theoretical guarantees.

Method: Introduces two new architectures: MNO and MONet for multiple operator learning. For multiple operators, uses parametric functions to represent continua of operators. For distinct operators, develops framework for balancing architectural complexity across subnetworks. Provides universal approximation results in continuous, integrable, and Lipschitz settings.

Result: Establishes universal approximation theorems for the proposed architectures in three settings. Derives explicit scaling laws showing how network size must grow to achieve target accuracy. Empirical experiments on parametric PDE benchmarks confirm strong expressive power and efficiency.

Conclusion: The work provides a unified theoretical and practical foundation for scalable neural operator learning across multiple operators, with both theoretical guarantees and empirical validation demonstrating effectiveness.

Abstract: While many problems in machine learning focus on learning mappings between
finite-dimensional spaces, scientific applications require approximating
mappings between function spaces, i.e., operators. We study the problem of
learning collections of operators and provide both theoretical and empirical
advances. We distinguish between two regimes: (i) multiple operator learning,
where a single network represents a continuum of operators parameterized by a
parametric function, and (ii) learning several distinct single operators, where
each operator is learned independently. For the multiple operator case, we
introduce two new architectures, $\mathrm{MNO}$ and $\mathrm{MONet}$, and
establish universal approximation results in three settings: continuous,
integrable, or Lipschitz operators. For the latter, we further derive explicit
scaling laws that quantify how the network size must grow to achieve a target
approximation accuracy. For learning several single operators, we develop a
framework for balancing architectural complexity across subnetworks and show
how approximation order determines computational efficiency. Empirical
experiments on parametric PDE benchmarks confirm the strong expressive power
and efficiency of the proposed architectures. Overall, this work establishes a
unified theoretical and practical foundation for scalable neural operator
learning across multiple operators.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GPTOpt is an LLM-based optimization method that enables large language models to perform continuous black-box optimization by fine-tuning them on synthetic datasets from diverse Bayesian Optimization parameterizations, achieving superior performance without parameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of classical Bayesian Optimization methods that require careful parameter tuning for each application domain, and to extend LLMs' capabilities to solve continuous black-box optimization tasks.

Method: Fine-tuning large language models on extensive synthetic datasets derived from diverse Bayesian Optimization parameterizations, leveraging LLM pre-training to generalize across optimization tasks.

Result: GPTOpt surpasses traditional optimizers on a variety of black-box optimization benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance without requiring parameter tuning.

Conclusion: The method highlights the capacity of LLMs for advanced numerical reasoning and introduces a flexible framework for global optimization that eliminates the need for parameter tuning.

Abstract: Global optimization of expensive, derivative-free black-box functions demands
extreme sample efficiency. Classical methods such as Bayesian Optimization (BO)
can be effective, but they often require careful parameter tuning to each
application domain. At the same time, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
broad capabilities, yet state-of-the-art models remain limited in solving
continuous black-box optimization tasks. We introduce GPTOpt, an LLM-based
optimization method that equips LLMs with continuous black-box optimization
capabilities. By fine-tuning large language models on extensive synthetic
datasets derived from diverse BO parameterizations, GPTOpt leverages LLM
pre-training to generalize across optimization tasks. On a variety of black-box
optimization benchmarks, GPTOpt surpasses traditional optimizers, highlighting
the capacity of LLMs for advanced numerical reasoning and introducing a
flexible framework for global optimization without parameter tuning.

*Mahmoud Hegazy,Michael I. Jordan,Aymeric Dieuleveut*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes utility calibration, a framework for evaluating multiclass classifier calibration using utility functions that reflect end-user goals, unifying existing metrics and enabling more robust assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multiclass calibration assessment methods are limited to specific prediction aspects or computationally intensive, lacking a scalable and comprehensive evaluation framework that aligns with practical utility needs.

Method: The authors introduce utility calibration, a general framework that measures calibration error relative to specific utility functions representing end-user decision criteria and goals.

Result: The framework unifies and reinterprets existing calibration metrics, enabling more robust versions of top-class and class-wise calibration, and extends assessment to richer classes of downstream utilities.

Conclusion: Utility calibration provides a scalable and comprehensive approach for evaluating multiclass classifier calibration that better aligns with practical utility requirements beyond traditional binarized approaches.

Abstract: Ensuring that classifiers are well-calibrated, i.e., their predictions align
with observed frequencies, is a minimal and fundamental requirement for
classifiers to be viewed as trustworthy. Existing methods for assessing
multiclass calibration often focus on specific aspects associated with
prediction (e.g., top-class confidence, class-wise calibration) or utilize
computationally challenging variational formulations. In this work, we study
scalable \emph{evaluation} of multiclass calibration. To this end, we propose
utility calibration, a general framework that measures the calibration error
relative to a specific utility function that encapsulates the goals or decision
criteria relevant to the end user. We demonstrate how this framework can unify
and re-interpret several existing calibration metrics, particularly allowing
for more robust versions of the top-class and class-wise calibration metrics,
and, going beyond such binarized approaches, toward assessing calibration for
richer classes of downstream utilities.

*Florian A. Hölzl,Daniel Rueckert,Georgios Kaissis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gradient-Weight Alignment (GWA) is introduced as a robust validation metric that quantifies coherence between per-sample gradients and model weights to track generalization during training without needing validation data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning lacks robust validation metrics that can detect overfitting, monitor training dynamics, and attribute performance to individual training samples without requiring separate validation sets.

Method: Proposes Gradient-Weight Alignment (GWA) which measures the alignment between per-sample gradients and model weights during training, with effective learning corresponding to coherent alignment and misalignment indicating poor generalization.

Result: Extensive experiments show GWA accurately predicts optimal early stopping, enables principled model comparisons, identifies influential training samples, and reflects both sample-specific contributions and dataset-wide learning dynamics.

Conclusion: GWA provides a validation-set-free approach for model analysis directly from training data, serving as an effective metric for tracking generalization and training dynamics in supervised classification.

Abstract: Robust validation metrics remain essential in contemporary deep learning, not
only to detect overfitting and poor generalization, but also to monitor
training dynamics. In the supervised classification setting, we investigate
whether interactions between training data and model weights can yield such a
metric that both tracks generalization during training and attributes
performance to individual training samples. We introduce Gradient-Weight
Alignment (GWA), quantifying the coherence between per-sample gradients and
model weights. We show that effective learning corresponds to coherent
alignment, while misalignment indicates deteriorating generalization. GWA is
efficiently computable during training and reflects both sample-specific
contributions and dataset-wide learning dynamics. Extensive experiments show
that GWA accurately predicts optimal early stopping, enables principled model
comparisons, and identifies influential training samples, providing a
validation-set-free approach for model analysis directly from the training
data.

*Luca Andolfi,Eleonora Giunchiglia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces prototypical neurosymbolic architectures to prevent reasoning shortcuts in neurosymbolic AI by ensuring models learn correct concepts rather than exploiting spurious correlations, even with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent neurosymbolic AI models are prone to shortcut reasoning, learning unintended concepts that exploit spurious correlations to satisfy symbolic constraints, which undermines reliability.

Method: Leveraging prototypical learning theory, the approach trains models to satisfy background knowledge while considering input similarity to few labeled datapoints, preventing reasoning shortcuts.

Result: Extensive validation on rsbench benchmark shows significant improvements in learning correct concepts in both synthetic tasks (MNIST-EvenOdd, Kand-Logic) and real-world high-stake tasks (BDD-OIA) with very scarce supervision.

Conclusion: Prototype grounding emerges as an effective, annotation-efficient strategy for safe and reliable neurosymbolic learning, addressing reasoning shortcuts at their root cause.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI is growing in popularity thanks to its ability to combine
neural perception and symbolic reasoning in end-to-end trainable models.
However, recent findings reveal these are prone to shortcut reasoning, i.e., to
learning unindented concepts--or neural predicates--which exploit spurious
correlations to satisfy the symbolic constraints. In this paper, we address
reasoning shortcuts at their root cause and we introduce prototypical
neurosymbolic architectures. These models are able to satisfy the symbolic
constraints (be right) because they have learnt the correct basic concepts (for
the right reasons) and not because of spurious correlations, even in extremely
low data regimes. Leveraging the theory of prototypical learning, we
demonstrate that we can effectively avoid reasoning shortcuts by training the
models to satisfy the background knowledge while taking into account the
similarity of the input with respect to the handful of labelled datapoints. We
extensively validate our approach on the recently proposed rsbench benchmark
suite in a variety of settings and tasks with very scarce supervision: we show
significant improvements in learning the right concepts both in synthetic tasks
(MNIST-EvenOdd and Kand-Logic) and real-world, high-stake ones (BDD-OIA). Our
findings pave the way to prototype grounding as an effective,
annotation-efficient strategy for safe and reliable neurosymbolic learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study developed a machine learning system using SVM to predict employee burnout risk with 84% accuracy, outperforming KNN and Random Forest models, and created an interactive Streamlit interface for practical organizational use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Burnout significantly impacts individual well-being and organizational performance, creating a need for early detection tools to support mental health strategies in workplace settings.

Method: Used supervised machine learning with three algorithms (KNN, Random Forest, SVM) on the HackerEarth Employee Burnout Challenge dataset, evaluated through 30-fold cross-validation with R2 metric, and developed an interactive Streamlit interface for user accessibility.

Result: SVM achieved the highest predictive performance (R2 = 0.84) and was statistically superior to KNN and Random Forest based on paired t-tests, demonstrating effective burnout risk prediction.

Conclusion: Machine learning shows strong potential for early burnout detection and can support data-driven mental health interventions in organizational contexts through accessible prediction tools.

Abstract: Burnout is a psychological syndrome marked by emotional exhaustion,
depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment, with a significant
impact on individual well-being and organizational performance. This study
proposes a machine learning approach to predict burnout risk using the
HackerEarth Employee Burnout Challenge dataset. Three supervised algorithms
were evaluated: nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest, and support vector
machine (SVM), with model performance evaluated through 30-fold
cross-validation using the determination coefficient (R2). Among the models
tested, SVM achieved the highest predictive performance (R2 = 0.84) and was
statistically superior to KNN and Random Forest based on paired $t$-tests. To
ensure practical applicability, an interactive interface was developed using
Streamlit, allowing non-technical users to input data and receive burnout risk
predictions. The results highlight the potential of machine learning to support
early detection of burnout and promote data-driven mental health strategies in
organizational settings.

### [120] [FaCT: Faithful Concept Traces for Explaining Neural Network Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25512)
*Amin Parchami-Araghi,Sukrut Rao,Jonas Fischer,Bernt Schiele*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new model with model-inherent mechanistic concept-explanations that are faithful, shared across classes, and can be traced from any layer to the logit and input visualization. It also introduces a concept-consistency metric (C²-Score) using foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept-based explanation methods for deep networks are not always faithful to the model and make restrictive assumptions about concepts (class-specificity, small spatial extent, alignment to human expectations). The authors aim to address these limitations by developing more faithful concept explanations.

Method: Proposed a new model with model-inherent mechanistic concept-explanations where concepts are shared across classes and their contributions can be faithfully traced from any layer to the logit and input visualization. Also introduced C²-Score metric using foundation models to evaluate concept consistency.

Result: The proposed concepts are quantitatively more consistent than prior work, users find them more interpretable, and the model retains competitive ImageNet performance.

Conclusion: The work successfully addresses faithfulness issues in concept-based explanations by developing model-inherent mechanistic concepts that are shared across classes, traceable, and evaluated using a new consistency metric, while maintaining competitive performance on ImageNet.

Abstract: Deep networks have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks,
yet getting a global concept-level understanding of how they function remains a
key challenge. Many post-hoc concept-based approaches have been introduced to
understand their workings, yet they are not always faithful to the model.
Further, they make restrictive assumptions on the concepts a model learns, such
as class-specificity, small spatial extent, or alignment to human expectations.
In this work, we put emphasis on the faithfulness of such concept-based
explanations and propose a new model with model-inherent mechanistic
concept-explanations. Our concepts are shared across classes and, from any
layer, their contribution to the logit and their input-visualization can be
faithfully traced. We also leverage foundation models to propose a new
concept-consistency metric, C$^2$-Score, that can be used to evaluate
concept-based methods. We show that, compared to prior work, our concepts are
quantitatively more consistent and users find our concepts to be more
interpretable, all while retaining competitive ImageNet performance.

### [121] [Transformers Provably Learn Directed Acyclic Graphs via Kernel-Guided Mutual Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25542)
*Yuan Cheng,Yu Huang,Zhe Xiong,Yingbin Liang,Vincent Y. F. Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel information-theoretic approach using kernel-guided mutual information to enable transformers to provably learn directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with multiple parents per node, overcoming previous limitations that restricted guarantees to tree-like structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transformer-based models have theoretical guarantees limited to tree-like graphs where each node depends on a single parent. Extending these guarantees to general DAGs with multiple parents per node is challenging due to difficulties in designing training objectives that allow different attention heads to learn multiple parent relationships separately.

Method: The authors propose a novel information-theoretic metric called kernel-guided mutual information (KG-MI) based on f-divergence. They combine this with a multi-head attention framework where each head uses a distinct marginal transition kernel to model diverse parent-child dependencies.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows that training a single-layer, multi-head transformer via gradient ascent converges to the global optimum in polynomial time for sequences generated by K-parent DAGs. When using KL divergence specifically, the learned attention scores accurately reflect the ground-truth adjacency matrix, enabling provable recovery of the underlying graph structure.

Conclusion: The proposed KG-MI objective enables transformers to provably learn general DAG structures with multiple parents per node, overcoming previous theoretical limitations. Experimental results validate the theoretical findings, demonstrating successful graph structure recovery.

Abstract: Uncovering hidden graph structures underlying real-world data is a critical
challenge with broad applications across scientific domains. Recently,
transformer-based models leveraging the attention mechanism have demonstrated
strong empirical success in capturing complex dependencies within graphs.
However, the theoretical understanding of their training dynamics has been
limited to tree-like graphs, where each node depends on a single parent.
Extending provable guarantees to more general directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) --
which involve multiple parents per node -- remains challenging, primarily due
to the difficulty in designing training objectives that enable different
attention heads to separately learn multiple different parent relationships.
  In this work, we address this problem by introducing a novel
information-theoretic metric: the kernel-guided mutual information (KG-MI),
based on the $f$-divergence. Our objective combines KG-MI with a multi-head
attention framework, where each head is associated with a distinct marginal
transition kernel to model diverse parent-child dependencies effectively. We
prove that, given sequences generated by a $K$-parent DAG, training a
single-layer, multi-head transformer via gradient ascent converges to the
global optimum in polynomial time. Furthermore, we characterize the attention
score patterns at convergence. In addition, when particularizing the
$f$-divergence to the KL divergence, the learned attention scores accurately
reflect the ground-truth adjacency matrix, thereby provably recovering the
underlying graph structure. Experimental results validate our theoretical
findings.

*Wenduan Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid quantum-classical recurrent neural network (QRNN) with a quantum recurrent core as a parametrized quantum circuit, achieving competitive performance on various sequence-learning tasks against classical baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a physically consistent quantum RNN that unifies unitary recurrence for high-capacity memory, partial observation via mid-circuit measurements, and nonlinear classical control, leveraging the exponentially large Hilbert space of quantum systems.

Method: The QRNN uses a parametrized quantum circuit (PQC) as its recurrent core, with hidden states residing in an n-qubit quantum state space. Mid-circuit readouts are combined with input embeddings and processed by a classical feedforward network, which parametrizes the PQC for unitary hidden state updates.

Result: The model was evaluated on sentiment analysis, MNIST, permuted MNIST, copying memory, and language modeling tasks with up to 14 qubits, and demonstrated competitive performance against strong classical baselines. A soft attention mechanism was also successfully applied for machine translation.

Conclusion: This is the first quantum-grounded model to achieve competitive performance across a broad class of sequence-learning tasks, successfully unifying quantum memory with classical nonlinear control in a physically consistent architecture.

Abstract: We present a hybrid quantum-classical recurrent neural network (QRNN)
architecture in which the entire recurrent core is realized as a parametrized
quantum circuit (PQC) controlled by a classical feedforward network. The hidden
state is the quantum state of an $n$-qubit PQC, residing in an exponentially
large Hilbert space $\mathbb{C}^{2^n}$. The PQC is unitary by construction,
making the hidden-state evolution norm-preserving without external constraints.
At each timestep, mid-circuit readouts are combined with the input embedding
and processed by the feedforward network, which provides explicit classical
nonlinearity. The outputs parametrize the PQC, which updates the hidden state
via unitary dynamics. The QRNN is compact and physically consistent, and it
unifies (i) unitary recurrence as a high-capacity memory, (ii) partial
observation via mid-circuit measurements, and (iii) nonlinear classical control
for input-conditioned parametrization. We evaluate the model in simulation with
up to 14 qubits on sentiment analysis, MNIST, permuted MNIST, copying memory,
and language modeling, adopting projective measurements as a limiting case to
obtain mid-circuit readouts while maintaining a coherent recurrent quantum
memory. We further devise a soft attention mechanism over the mid-circuit
readouts in a sequence-to-sequence model and show its effectiveness for machine
translation. To our knowledge, this is the first model (RNN or otherwise)
grounded in quantum operations to achieve competitive performance against
strong classical baselines across a broad class of sequence-learning tasks.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the feasibility of using deep learning models pre-trained in different domains for oceanic applications, contributing to data-driven ocean forecasting. Future improvements include integrating more variables, increasing resolution, and exploring physics-informed neural networks.

Abstract: The accurate prediction of oceanographic variables is crucial for
understanding climate change, managing marine resources, and optimizing
maritime activities. Traditional ocean forecasting relies on numerical models;
however, these approaches face limitations in terms of computational cost and
scalability. In this study, we adapt Aurora, a foundational deep learning model
originally designed for atmospheric forecasting, to predict sea surface
temperature (SST) in the Canary Upwelling System. By fine-tuning this model
with high-resolution oceanographic reanalysis data, we demonstrate its ability
to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns while reducing computational
demands. Our methodology involves a staged fine-tuning process, incorporating
latitude-weighted error metrics and optimizing hyperparameters for efficient
learning. The experimental results show that the model achieves a low RMSE of
0.119K, maintaining high anomaly correlation coefficients (ACC $\approx
0.997$). The model successfully reproduces large-scale SST structures but faces
challenges in capturing finer details in coastal regions. This work contributes
to the field of data-driven ocean forecasting by demonstrating the feasibility
of using deep learning models pre-trained in different domains for oceanic
applications. Future improvements include integrating additional oceanographic
variables, increasing spatial resolution, and exploring physics-informed neural
networks to enhance interpretability and understanding. These advancements can
improve climate modeling and ocean prediction accuracy, supporting

*Benjamin Leblanc,Pascal Germain*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework to extract deterministic hypothesis guarantees from stochastic PAC-Bayesian bounds, enabling practical deployment of single classifiers while maintaining strong generalization guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical PAC-Bayes only provides guarantees for randomly sampled hypotheses, requiring stochastic predictions at test time, which is impractical for many real-world applications where deterministic classifiers are needed.

Method: Proposed unified framework with general oracle bound, numerical bound derivation, and specialization to majority vote classifiers to extract single-hypothesis guarantees from stochastic PAC-Bayesian bounds.

Result: Empirical results show the approach consistently outperforms popular baselines by up to a factor of 2 in generalization bounds for deterministic classifiers.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the gap between stochastic PAC-Bayesian theory and practical deterministic classifier deployment, providing stronger generalization guarantees for single hypotheses.

Abstract: PAC-Bayes is a popular and efficient framework for obtaining generalization
guarantees in situations involving uncountable hypothesis spaces.
Unfortunately, in its classical formulation, it only provides guarantees on the
expected risk of a randomly sampled hypothesis. This requires stochastic
predictions at test time, making PAC-Bayes unusable in many practical
situations where a single deterministic hypothesis must be deployed. We propose
a unified framework to extract guarantees holding for a single hypothesis from
stochastic PAC-Bayesian guarantees. We present a general oracle bound and
derive from it a numerical bound and a specialization to majority vote. We
empirically show that our approach consistently outperforms popular baselines
(by up to a factor of 2) when it comes to generalization bounds on
deterministic classifiers.

*Phuc Tran,Nisheeth K. Vishnoi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies the spectral-norm robustness of low-rank pseudoinverse approximations for noisy symmetric matrices, deriving sharp perturbation bounds that improve classical results by up to √n factor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-rank pseudoinverses are widely used in scalable machine learning and scientific computing, but their robustness to noise (from sampling, sketching, quantization) remains poorly understood, especially for real-world noisy matrices.

Method: The authors systematically study spectral-norm error for noisy symmetric matrices using contour integral techniques applied to the non-entire function f(z)=1/z, analyzing how error scales with eigengap, spectral decay, and noise alignment with low-curvature directions.

Result: The derived bounds improve over naive adaptations of classical full-inverse bounds by up to √n factor and closely track true perturbation error across real-world and synthetic matrices, while classical estimates tend to significantly overpredict.

Conclusion: The findings provide practical, spectrum-aware guarantees for low-rank inverse approximations in noisy computational environments, offering improved understanding of robustness to noise in scalable computing applications.

Abstract: Low-rank pseudoinverses are widely used to approximate matrix inverses in
scalable machine learning, optimization, and scientific computing. However,
real-world matrices are often observed with noise, arising from sampling,
sketching, and quantization. The spectral-norm robustness of low-rank inverse
approximations remains poorly understood. We systematically study the
spectral-norm error $\| (\tilde{A}^{-1})_p - A_p^{-1} \|$ for an $n\times n$
symmetric matrix $A$, where $A_p^{-1}$ denotes the best rank-\(p\)
approximation of $A^{-1}$, and $\tilde{A} = A + E$ is a noisy observation.
Under mild assumptions on the noise, we derive sharp non-asymptotic
perturbation bounds that reveal how the error scales with the eigengap,
spectral decay, and noise alignment with low-curvature directions of $A$. Our
analysis introduces a novel application of contour integral techniques to the
\emph{non-entire} function $f(z) = 1/z$, yielding bounds that improve over
naive adaptations of classical full-inverse bounds by up to a factor of
$\sqrt{n}$. Empirically, our bounds closely track the true perturbation error
across a variety of real-world and synthetic matrices, while estimates based on
classical results tend to significantly overpredict. These findings offer
practical, spectrum-aware guarantees for low-rank inverse approximations in
noisy computational environments.

### [126] [Generalized Sobolev IPM for Graph-Based Measures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25591)
*Tam Le,Truyen Nguyen,Hideitsu Hino,Kenji Fukumizu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a generalization of Sobolev IPM using Orlicz geometric structure to overcome limitations of L^p geometry, establishes a theoretical connection to Musielak norm for regularization, and achieves computational efficiency through univariate optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitation of Sobolev IPM being intrinsically bound to L^p geometric structure, which restricts its ability to incorporate alternative structural priors beyond the L^p geometry paradigm.

Method: Generalize Sobolev IPM through Orlicz geometric structure, establish theoretical connection between Orlicz-Sobolev norm and Musielak norm for regularization, and exploit graph structure to reduce the problem to univariate optimization (GSI-M).

Result: GSI-M is several-order faster than popular Orlicz-Wasserstein (OW) in computation and demonstrates practical advantages in comparing probability measures on graphs for document classification and topological data analysis tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed GSI-M framework successfully generalizes Sobolev IPM beyond L^p geometry while achieving remarkable computational efficiency through theoretical connections and graph structure exploitation.

Abstract: We study the Sobolev IPM problem for measures supported on a graph metric
space, where critic function is constrained to lie within the unit ball defined
by Sobolev norm. While Le et al. (2025) achieved scalable computation by
relating Sobolev norm to weighted $L^p$-norm, the resulting framework remains
intrinsically bound to $L^p$ geometric structure, limiting its ability to
incorporate alternative structural priors beyond the $L^p$ geometry paradigm.
To overcome this limitation, we propose to generalize Sobolev IPM through the
lens of \emph{Orlicz geometric structure}, which employs convex functions to
capture nuanced geometric relationships, building upon recent advances in
optimal transport theory -- particularly Orlicz-Wasserstein (OW) and
generalized Sobolev transport -- that have proven instrumental in advancing
machine learning methodologies. This generalization encompasses classical
Sobolev IPM as a special case while accommodating diverse geometric priors
beyond traditional $L^p$ structure. It however brings up significant
computational hurdles that compound those already inherent in Sobolev IPM. To
address these challenges, we establish a novel theoretical connection between
Orlicz-Sobolev norm and Musielak norm which facilitates a novel regularization
for the generalized Sobolev IPM (GSI). By further exploiting the underlying
graph structure, we show that GSI with Musielak regularization (GSI-M) reduces
to a simple \emph{univariate optimization} problem, achieving remarkably
computational efficiency. Empirically, GSI-M is several-order faster than the
popular OW in computation, and demonstrates its practical advantages in
comparing probability measures on a given graph for document classification and
several tasks in topological data analysis.

### [127] [Feedback Alignment Meets Low-Rank Manifolds: A Structured Recipe for Local Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25594)
*Arani Roy,Marco P. Apolinario,Shristi Das Biswas,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a structured local learning framework using SVD decomposition to train DNNs on low-rank manifolds, achieving BP-comparable accuracy with reduced parameters and memory requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of BP (high memory/computation) and DFA (poor scalability in deep CNNs) by developing a principled local learning alternative that operates efficiently on low-rank representations.

Method: Train layers in decomposed SVD form with composite loss (cross-entropy + subspace alignment + orthogonality regularization), construct structured feedback matrices matching SVD structure for consistent forward-backward alignment.

Result: Achieves accuracy comparable to BP on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet while reducing trainable parameters without pruning; ablation studies confirm importance of each loss component.

Conclusion: Local learning on low-rank manifolds provides a scalable, principled alternative to full-rank gradient-based training with comparable performance and reduced resource requirements.

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) with backpropagation (BP) achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy but requires global error propagation and full
parameterization, leading to substantial memory and computational overhead.
Direct Feedback Alignment (DFA) enables local, parallelizable updates with
lower memory requirements but is limited by unstructured feedback and poor
scalability in deeper architectures, specially convolutional neural networks.
To address these limitations, we propose a structured local learning framework
that operates directly on low-rank manifolds defined by the Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) of weight matrices. Each layer is trained in its decomposed
form, with updates applied to the SVD components using a composite loss that
integrates cross-entropy, subspace alignment, and orthogonality regularization.
Feedback matrices are constructed to match the SVD structure, ensuring
consistent alignment between forward and feedback pathways. Our method reduces
the number of trainable parameters relative to the original DFA model, without
relying on pruning or post hoc compression. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and ImageNet show that our method achieves accuracy comparable to that of BP.
Ablation studies confirm the importance of each loss term in the low-rank
setting. These results establish local learning on low-rank manifolds as a
principled and scalable alternative to full-rank gradient-based training.

### [128] [Uncertainty Quantification for Regression: A Unified Framework based on kernel scores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25599)
*Christopher Bülte,Yusuf Sale,Gitta Kutyniok,Eyke Hüllermeier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for uncertainty quantification in regression tasks using proper scoring rules, particularly kernel scores, that unifies existing measures and provides guidelines for designing new uncertainty measures with controllable properties like robustness and out-of-distribution detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Regression tasks in safety-critical domains require proper uncertainty quantification, but current literature is largely focused on classification, creating a gap in regression uncertainty measures.

Method: Introduces a family of measures for total, aleatoric, and epistemic uncertainty based on proper scoring rules with emphasis on kernel scores, proving explicit correspondences between kernel characteristics and downstream behavior.

Result: Extensive experiments show the measures are effective in downstream tasks and reveal clear trade-offs among instantiations, including robustness and out-of-distribution detection performance.

Conclusion: The framework provides a principled recipe for designing uncertainty measures whose behavior is governed by kernel choice, offering concrete design guidelines for task-specific uncertainty quantification in regression.

Abstract: Regression tasks, notably in safety-critical domains, require proper
uncertainty quantification, yet the literature remains largely
classification-focused. In this light, we introduce a family of measures for
total, aleatoric, and epistemic uncertainty based on proper scoring rules, with
a particular emphasis on kernel scores. The framework unifies several
well-known measures and provides a principled recipe for designing new ones
whose behavior, such as tail sensitivity, robustness, and out-of-distribution
responsiveness, is governed by the choice of kernel. We prove explicit
correspondences between kernel-score characteristics and downstream behavior,
yielding concrete design guidelines for task-specific measures. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that these measures are effective in downstream tasks
and reveal clear trade-offs among instantiations, including robustness and
out-of-distribution detection performance.

### [129] [INT v.s. FP: A Comprehensive Study of Fine-Grained Low-bit Quantization Formats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25602)
*Mengzhao Chen,Meng Wu,Hui Jin,Zhihang Yuan,Jing Liu,Chaoyi Zhang,Yunshui Li,Jie Huang,Jin Ma,Zeyue Xue,Zhiheng Liu,Xingyan Bin,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper systematically compares floating-point (FP) and integer (INT) quantization formats for AI hardware, revealing that fine-grained INT formats like MXINT8 outperform FP counterparts in both accuracy and efficiency for 8-bit quantization, while FP formats maintain advantages for 4-bit quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide clear guidance for AI hardware and algorithm co-design by conducting a unified comparison of FP and INT quantization formats across different granularities, addressing the gap in understanding trade-offs between these formats despite industry's trend toward low-precision FP formats.

Method: The method involves systematic investigation of trade-offs between FP and INT formats across varying granularities, including analysis of performance crossover points, comparison of 8-bit and 4-bit formats, introduction of symmetric clipping method for INT training, and application of outlier-mitigation techniques like Hadamard rotation.

Result: Results show a critical performance crossover: FP excels in coarse-grained quantization but fine-grained INT formats (MXINT8) are superior for 8-bit quantization in both accuracy and hardware efficiency. For 4-bit formats, FP often has accuracy advantages, though NVINT4 can surpass NVFP4 with outlier-mitigation techniques. The symmetric clipping method enables nearly lossless MXINT8 training.

Conclusion: The findings challenge the current hardware trajectory toward FP formats, demonstrating that a one-size-fits-all FP approach is suboptimal and advocating for fine-grained INT formats, particularly MXINT8, as offering better balance of accuracy, power, and efficiency for future AI accelerators.

Abstract: Modern AI hardware, such as Nvidia's Blackwell architecture, is increasingly
embracing low-precision floating-point (FP) formats to handle the pervasive
activation outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite this industry
trend, a unified comparison of FP and integer (INT) quantization across varying
granularities has been missing, leaving algorithm and hardware co-design
without clear guidance. This paper fills that gap by systematically
investigating the trade-offs between FP and INT formats. We reveal a critical
performance crossover: while FP excels in coarse-grained quantization, the
comparison at fine-grained (block-wise) levels is more nuanced. Our
comprehensive comparison demonstrates that for popular 8-bit fine-grained
formats (e.g., MX with block size 32), MXINT8 is superior to its FP counterpart
in both algorithmic accuracy and hardware efficiency. However, for 4-bit
formats, FP (e.g., MXFP4, NVFP4) often holds an accuracy advantage , though we
show that NVINT4 can surpass NVFP4 when outlier-mitigation techniques like
Hadamard rotation are applied. We also introduce a symmetric clipping method
that resolves gradient bias in fine-grained low-bit INT training, enabling
nearly lossless performance for MXINT8 training. These findings challenge the
current hardware trajectory, demonstrating that a one-size-fits-all FP approach
is suboptimal and advocating that fine-grained INT formats, particularly
MXINT8, offer a better balance of accuracy, power, and efficiency for future AI
accelerators.

Motivation: To improve GAN training stability and performance by incorporating the Bayes Optimal Learning Threshold principle into the WGAN framework, addressing limitations of the Earth Mover distance.

Method: Modified WGAN framework with Lipschitz continuous discriminator that implicitly minimizes a different metric distance than the Wasserstein distance, inspired by the Bayes Optimal Learning Threshold principle.

Result: Empirical evaluations on CIFAR-10, CelebA-64, LSUN Bedroom-64, and LSUN Church-64 show BOLT-GAN consistently outperforms WGAN with 10-60% lower Frechet Inception Distance (FID).

Conclusion: BOLT is a broadly applicable principle for enhancing GAN training, providing better stability and performance compared to standard WGAN approaches.

Abstract: We introduce BOLT-GAN, a simple yet effective modification of the WGAN
framework inspired by the Bayes Optimal Learning Threshold (BOLT). We show that
with a Lipschitz continuous discriminator, BOLT-GAN implicitly minimizes a
different metric distance than the Earth Mover (Wasserstein) distance and
achieves better training stability. Empirical evaluations on four standard
image generation benchmarks (CIFAR-10, CelebA-64, LSUN Bedroom-64, and LSUN
Church-64) show that BOLT-GAN consistently outperforms WGAN, achieving 10-60%
lower Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Our results suggest that BOLT is a
broadly applicable principle for enhancing GAN training.

*Nikita Kachaev,Mikhail Kolosov,Daniil Zelezetsky,Alexey K. Kovalev,Aleksandr I. Panov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies how Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models lose their original vision-language capabilities during action fine-tuning, and proposes methods to mitigate this degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) retain their world knowledge and vision-language grounding when adapted to action tasks, and to address the degradation of visual representations during VLA fine-tuning.

Method: Systematic analysis of representation retention during VLA fine-tuning through probing hidden representations and attention maps, plus designing targeted tasks to compare VLA models with VLMs. Also evaluates various visual representation alignment strategies.

Result: Naive action fine-tuning leads to degradation of visual representations, but the proposed method effectively mitigates this degradation and improves generalization to out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: The study clarifies the trade-off between action fine-tuning and VL representation degradation, and provides practical approaches to recover inherited vision-language capabilities in VLA models.

Abstract: The growing success of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models stems from the
promise that pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can endow agents with
transferable world knowledge and vision-language (VL) grounding, laying a
foundation for action models with broader generalization. Yet when these VLMs
are adapted to the action modality, it remains unclear to what extent their
original VL representations and knowledge are preserved. In this work, we
conduct a systematic study of representation retention during VLA fine-tuning,
showing that naive action fine-tuning leads to degradation of visual
representations. To characterize and measure these effects, we probe VLA's
hidden representations and analyze attention maps, further, we design a set of
targeted tasks and methods that contrast VLA models with their counterpart
VLMs, isolating changes in VL capabilities induced by action fine-tuning. We
further evaluate a range of strategies for aligning visual representations and
introduce a simple yet effective method that mitigates degradation and yields
improved generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Taken together,
our analysis clarifies the trade-off between action fine-tuning and the
degradation of VL representations and highlights practical approaches to
recover inherited VL capabilities. Code is publicly available:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedLap is a novel federated learning framework for graph-structured data that uses Laplacian smoothing in the spectral domain to capture inter-node dependencies while ensuring privacy and scalability, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated learning approaches for graph-structured data either require exchanging sensitive node embeddings (privacy risks) or rely on computationally-intensive steps (scalability issues), especially in interconnected subgraph scenarios.

Method: FedLap leverages global structure information via Laplacian smoothing in the spectral domain to effectively capture inter-node dependencies while preserving privacy and maintaining scalability.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedLap achieves competitive or superior utility compared to existing techniques while providing strong privacy guarantees.

Conclusion: FedLap is the first subgraph federated learning scheme with strong privacy guarantees that effectively addresses both privacy and scalability challenges in graph-structured federated learning.

Abstract: We consider the problem of federated learning (FL) with graph-structured data
distributed across multiple clients. In particular, we address the prevalent
scenario of interconnected subgraphs, where interconnections between clients
significantly influence the learning process. Existing approaches suffer from
critical limitations, either requiring the exchange of sensitive node
embeddings, thereby posing privacy risks, or relying on
computationally-intensive steps, which hinders scalability. To tackle these
challenges, we propose FedLap, a novel framework that leverages global
structure information via Laplacian smoothing in the spectral domain to
effectively capture inter-node dependencies while ensuring privacy and
scalability. We provide a formal analysis of the privacy of FedLap,
demonstrating that it preserves privacy. Notably, FedLap is the first subgraph
FL scheme with strong privacy guarantees. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that FedLap achieves competitive or superior utility
compared to existing techniques.

### [133] [Spectral Perturbation Bounds for Low-Rank Approximation with Applications to Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25670)
*Phuc Tran,Nisheeth K. Vishnoi,Van H. Vu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: New spectral-norm perturbation bounds for symmetric matrices that improve classical results by up to √n factor, with applications to differentially private PCA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how noise affects low-rank approximations in spectral norm is crucial for differentially private machine learning, as spectral norm captures worst-case directional error and provides strongest utility guarantees.

Method: Developed novel contour bootstrapping method from complex analysis to establish high-probability spectral-norm perturbation bounds, extending to spectral functionals like polynomials and matrix exponentials.

Result: Under mild eigengap and norm conditions, bounds yield sharp estimates for ||(A+E)_p - A_p|| with improvements up to √n factor, resolving open problem in differentially private PCA literature.

Conclusion: The new perturbation bounds provide improved utility guarantees for differentially private PCA and closely track actual spectral error in empirical evaluations on real-world datasets.

Abstract: A central challenge in machine learning is to understand how noise or
measurement errors affect low-rank approximations, particularly in the spectral
norm. This question is especially important in differentially private low-rank
approximation, where one aims to preserve the top-$p$ structure of a
data-derived matrix while ensuring privacy. Prior work often analyzes Frobenius
norm error or changes in reconstruction quality, but these metrics can over- or
under-estimate true subspace distortion. The spectral norm, by contrast,
captures worst-case directional error and provides the strongest utility
guarantees. We establish new high-probability spectral-norm perturbation bounds
for symmetric matrices that refine the classical Eckart--Young--Mirsky theorem
and explicitly capture interactions between a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n
\times n}$ and an arbitrary symmetric perturbation $E$. Under mild eigengap and
norm conditions, our bounds yield sharp estimates for $\|(A + E)_p - A_p\|$,
where $A_p$ is the best rank-$p$ approximation of $A$, with improvements of up
to a factor of $\sqrt{n}$. As an application, we derive improved utility
guarantees for differentially private PCA, resolving an open problem in the
literature. Our analysis relies on a novel contour bootstrapping method from
complex analysis and extends it to a broad class of spectral functionals,
including polynomials and matrix exponentials. Empirical results on real-world
datasets confirm that our bounds closely track the actual spectral error under
diverse perturbation regimes.

*Elia Torre,Michele Viscione,Lucas Pompe,Benjamin F Grewe,Valerio Mante*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RNNs can replicate HMM emission statistics and implement probabilistic computations through noise-sustained dynamics along closed orbits, with structured connectivity featuring 'kick neurons' that enable transitions between discrete behavioral states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how RNNs can generate rich, spontaneous, and stochastic behaviors observed in natural settings, which contrasts with their typical use for simple, deterministic behaviors.

Method: Train RNNs to replicate HMM emission statistics, then reverse-engineer the trained networks to uncover the mechanisms they implement, analyzing across multiple HMM architectures (fully connected, cyclic, and linear-chain).

Result: Trained RNNs develop noise-sustained dynamics along closed orbits, with transitions governed by regions of slow, noise-driven dynamics connected by fast deterministic transitions, enabled by a small set of 'kick neurons' that emerge through stochastic resonance.

Conclusion: RNNs can emulate complex discrete latent dynamics through a compositional principle involving modular reuse of the same dynamical motif, enabling probabilistic computations that bridge continuous RNN state spaces with discrete HMM-like behaviors.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) provide a powerful approach in neuroscience
to infer latent dynamics in neural populations and to generate hypotheses about
the neural computations underlying behavior. However, past work has focused on
relatively simple, input-driven, and largely deterministic behaviors - little
is known about the mechanisms that would allow RNNs to generate the richer,
spontaneous, and potentially stochastic behaviors observed in natural settings.
Modeling with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) has revealed a segmentation of
natural behaviors into discrete latent states with stochastic transitions
between them, a type of dynamics that may appear at odds with the continuous
state spaces implemented by RNNs. Here we first show that RNNs can replicate
HMM emission statistics and then reverse-engineer the trained networks to
uncover the mechanisms they implement. In the absence of inputs, the activity
of trained RNNs collapses towards a single fixed point. When driven by
stochastic input, trajectories instead exhibit noise-sustained dynamics along
closed orbits. Rotation along these orbits modulates the emission probabilities
and is governed by transitions between regions of slow, noise-driven dynamics
connected by fast, deterministic transitions. The trained RNNs develop highly
structured connectivity, with a small set of "kick neurons" initiating
transitions between these regions. This mechanism emerges during training as
the network shifts into a regime of stochastic resonance, enabling it to
perform probabilistic computations. Analyses across multiple HMM architectures
- fully connected, cyclic, and linear-chain - reveal that this solution
generalizes through the modular reuse of the same dynamical motif, suggesting a
compositional principle by which RNNs can emulate complex discrete latent
dynamics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GNSS is a Graph Neural Network framework for surrogate modeling of dynamic structural problems, featuring node-fixed local frames, sign-aware regression loss, and wavelength-informed connectivity to accurately simulate wave-dominated structural dynamics with significant speedups over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in applying Graph Neural Networks to structural problems, particularly dynamic cases, as current research has focused mainly on computational fluid dynamics rather than structural simulations.

Method: Uses encode-process-decode GNN paradigm with three key innovations: node kinematics in local frames to avoid catastrophic cancellation, sign-aware regression loss to reduce phase errors, and wavelength-informed connectivity radius for optimal graph construction.

Result: GNSS accurately reproduces physics over hundreds of timesteps, generalizes to unseen loading conditions where existing GNNs fail, and achieves substantial inference speedups while preserving spatial and temporal fidelity compared to explicit finite element methods.

Conclusion: Locality-preserving GNNs with physics-consistent update rules are a competitive alternative for dynamic, wave-dominated structural simulations, demonstrating the viability of GNN-based surrogate models for structural dynamics.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been explored as surrogate models
for numerical simulations. While their applications in computational fluid
dynamics have been investigated, little attention has been given to structural
problems, especially for dynamic cases. To address this gap, we introduce the
Graph Network-based Structural Simulator (GNSS), a GNN framework for surrogate
modeling of dynamic structural problems.
  GNSS follows the encode-process-decode paradigm typical of GNN-based machine
learning models, and its design makes it particularly suited for dynamic
simulations thanks to three key features: (i) expressing node kinematics in
node-fixed local frames, which avoids catastrophic cancellation in
finite-difference velocities; (ii) employing a sign-aware regression loss,
which reduces phase errors in long rollouts; and (iii) using a
wavelength-informed connectivity radius, which optimizes graph construction.
  We evaluate GNSS on a case study involving a beam excited by a 50kHz
Hanning-modulated pulse. The results show that GNSS accurately reproduces the
physics of the problem over hundreds of timesteps and generalizes to unseen
loading conditions, where existing GNNs fail to converge or deliver meaningful
predictions.
  Compared with explicit finite element baselines, GNSS achieves substantial
inference speedups while preserving spatial and temporal fidelity. These
findings demonstrate that locality-preserving GNNs with physics-consistent
update rules are a competitive alternative for dynamic, wave-dominated
structural simulations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CS-GRU, a Convolutional Spiking GRU cell that combines convolutional operations with spiking neurons and GRU gating to better capture local dependencies in temporal and spatio-temporal data, achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RNNs lose local details in long sequences, and previous approaches like SpikGRU fail to capture fine-grained local dependencies in event-based spatio-temporal data. There is a need for a more robust framework that preserves local structure while maintaining temporal precision.

Method: The authors propose the Convolutional Spiking GRU (CS-GRU) cell, which integrates convolutional operations to preserve local structure and dependencies, combining the temporal precision of spiking neurons with the efficient gating mechanisms of GRUs.

Result: CS-GRU outperforms state-of-the-art GRU variants by an average of 4.35%, achieving over 90% accuracy on sequential tasks and up to 99.31% on MNIST. It achieves 69% higher efficiency compared to SpikGRU across temporal datasets (NTIDIGITS, SHD) and spatio-temporal benchmarks (MNIST, DVSGesture, CIFAR10DVS).

Conclusion: The CS-GRU architecture provides a versatile solution that excels at processing both temporal and spatio-temporal data by effectively capturing local dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency, representing a significant improvement over existing GRU variants.

Abstract: Spike-based temporal messaging enables SNNs to efficiently process both
purely temporal and spatio-temporal time-series or event-driven data. Combining
SNNs with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), a variant of recurrent neural networks,
gives rise to a robust framework for sequential data processing; however,
traditional RNNs often lose local details when handling long sequences.
Previous approaches, such as SpikGRU, fail to capture fine-grained local
dependencies in event-based spatio-temporal data. In this paper, we introduce
the Convolutional Spiking GRU (CS-GRU) cell, which leverages convolutional
operations to preserve local structure and dependencies while integrating the
temporal precision of spiking neurons with the efficient gating mechanisms of
GRUs. This versatile architecture excels on both temporal datasets (NTIDIGITS,
SHD) and spatio-temporal benchmarks (MNIST, DVSGesture, CIFAR10DVS). Our
experiments show that CS-GRU outperforms state-of-the-art GRU variants by an
average of 4.35%, achieving over 90% accuracy on sequential tasks and up to
99.31% on MNIST. It is worth noting that our solution achieves 69% higher

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more efficient and reliable method for solving initial-boundary value problems that inherently incorporates physical laws through symmetry transformations.

Method: Uses Lie symmetries to enforce PDEs exactly by construction, learning solutions from initial and boundary data through symmetry transformations.

Result: LieSolver is faster and more accurate than physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for linear homogeneous PDEs with various initial conditions.

Conclusion: The method improves computational efficiency and prediction reliability for PDE-constrained problems while enabling rigorous error estimation for well-posed IBVPs.

Abstract: We introduce a method for efficiently solving initial-boundary value problems
(IBVPs) that uses Lie symmetries to enforce the associated partial differential
equation (PDE) exactly by construction. By leveraging symmetry transformations,
the model inherently incorporates the physical laws and learns solutions from
initial and boundary data. As a result, the loss directly measures the model's
accuracy, leading to improved convergence. Moreover, for well-posed IBVPs, our
method enables rigorous error estimation. The approach yields compact models,
facilitating an efficient optimization. We implement LieSolver and demonstrate
its application to linear homogeneous PDEs with a range of initial conditions,
showing that it is faster and more accurate than physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs). Overall, our method improves both computational efficiency
and the reliability of predictions for PDE-constrained problems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes limitations of standard multiple instance learning (MIL) methods in medical imaging, which ignore contextual relationships between adjacent patches/slices. It creates a synthetic classification task where accounting for nearby instances is crucial, and shows current MIL approaches underperform compared to the optimal Bayes estimator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional MIL methods treat instances separately, ignoring contextual relationships between adjacent patches or slices that are essential for accurate classification in medical imaging applications.

Method: Design a synthetic classification task where accounting for adjacent instance features is crucial, and compare off-the-shelf MIL approaches against the optimal Bayes estimator (available in closed-form) to quantify their limitations.

Result: Standard MIL approaches demonstrate significant limitations, and even newer correlated MIL methods struggle to generalize optimally when trained from scratch on tens of thousands of instances.

Conclusion: Current MIL methods, including newer correlated approaches, fail to effectively capture contextual relationships between adjacent instances, highlighting the need for improved methods that can better account for spatial dependencies in medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) is often used in medical imaging to classify
high-resolution 2D images by processing patches or classify 3D volumes by
processing slices. However, conventional MIL approaches treat instances
separately, ignoring contextual relationships such as the appearance of nearby
patches or slices that can be essential in real applications. We design a
synthetic classification task where accounting for adjacent instance features
is crucial for accurate prediction. We demonstrate the limitations of
off-the-shelf MIL approaches by quantifying their performance compared to the
optimal Bayes estimator for this task, which is available in closed-form. We
empirically show that newer correlated MIL methods still struggle to generalize
as well as possible when trained from scratch on tens of thousands of
instances.

*Naoki Kiyohara,Edward Johns,Yingzhen Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural Stochastic Flows (NSFs) learn SDE transition laws using conditional normalizing flows, enabling efficient one-shot sampling between arbitrary time points with up to 100x speed-up compared to traditional numerical solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SDE modeling requires costly numerical solvers for sampling between arbitrary time points, which is inefficient for noisy and irregularly sampled time series common in finance, physics, and machine learning.

Method: NSFs use conditional normalizing flows with architectural constraints to directly learn SDE transition laws while preserving properties from stochastic flows, enabling one-shot sampling between arbitrary states.

Result: NSFs achieve up to two orders of magnitude speed-up at large time gaps compared to numerical approaches while maintaining comparable distributional accuracy on synthetic SDE simulations and real-world tracking/video data.

Conclusion: NSFs provide an efficient alternative to traditional numerical SDE solvers, dramatically reducing computation for arbitrary time-point sampling while preserving accuracy.

Abstract: Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are well suited to modelling noisy
and irregularly sampled time series found in finance, physics, and machine
learning. Traditional approaches require costly numerical solvers to sample
between arbitrary time points. We introduce Neural Stochastic Flows (NSFs) and
their latent variants, which directly learn (latent) SDE transition laws using
conditional normalising flows with architectural constraints that preserve
properties inherited from stochastic flows. This enables one-shot sampling
between arbitrary states and yields up to two orders of magnitude speed-ups at
large time gaps. Experiments on synthetic SDE simulations and on real-world
tracking and video data show that NSFs maintain distributional accuracy
comparable to numerical approaches while dramatically reducing computation for
arbitrary time-point sampling.

### [140] [Scheduling Your LLM Reinforcement Learning with Reasoning Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24832)
*Hong Wang,Zhezheng Hao,Jian Luo,Chenxing Wei,Yao Shu,Lei Liu,Qiang Lin,Hande Dong,Jiawei Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Re-Schedule, a novel data scheduling algorithm for RLVR that uses Reasoning Score (r-score) to rank queries based on their reasoning tree complexity, progressing from simple to complex queries to improve accuracy in math reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR data scheduling methods use path-based metrics that ignore reasoning tree structures, limiting their effectiveness in optimizing LLM training through reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards.

Method: Proposed Reasoning Score (r-score) to measure query learning difficulty based on reasoning tree structure, and developed Re-Schedule algorithm that creates a curriculum from simple (high r-score) to complex (low r-score) queries.

Result: Experiments on six math-reasoning benchmarks show Re-Schedule significantly improves average accuracy by up to 3.2%, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Conclusion: Structural understanding of reasoning trees provides a more powerful and principled foundation for RLVR data scheduling, leading to improved training efficiency and accuracy in mathematical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize Large
Language Models (LLMs) can be conceptualized as progressively editing a query's
`Reasoning Tree'. This process involves exploring nodes (tokens) and
dynamically modifying the model's policy at each node. When combined with data
scheduling, this process yields further gains in data efficiency and accuracy.
However, existing RLVR data scheduling methods typically rely on path-based
metrics to rank queries, overlooking the reasoning tree structures of these
queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric, namely Reasoning Score
(r-score), which measures the query's learning difficulty based on the
structure of its reasoning tree. Based on the r-score, we propose the Reasoning
Tree Schedule (Re-Schedule), a scheduling algorithm that constructs a
curriculum progressing from structurally simple (high r-score) to complex (low
r-score) queries. Experiments on six math-reasoning benchmarks show that
Re-Schedule significantly improves average accuracy, achieving gains of up to
3.2%. These strong results validate our approach and demonstrate that a
structural understanding of the reasoning tree provides a more powerful and
principled foundation for RLVR data scheduling.

*Saptarshi Saha,Dhruv Vansraj Rathore,Utpal Garain*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper studies counterfactual inference in cyclic structural causal models (SCMs) under shift-scale interventions, addressing the limitation of traditional frameworks that assume acyclic models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional counterfactual inference frameworks assume acyclic SCMs (DAGs), but many real-world systems like biological systems contain feedback loops and cyclic dependencies that violate acyclicity.

Method: The authors study counterfactual inference in cyclic SCMs under shift-scale interventions, which are soft, policy-style changes that rescale and/or shift a variable's mechanism.

Result: Not specified in the provided abstract content.

Conclusion: Not specified in the provided abstract content.

Abstract: Most counterfactual inference frameworks traditionally assume acyclic
structural causal models (SCMs), i.e. directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). However,
many real-world systems (e.g. biological systems) contain feedback loops or
cyclic dependencies that violate acyclicity. In this work, we study
counterfactual inference in cyclic SCMs under shift-scale interventions, i.e.,
soft, policy-style changes that rescale and/or shift a variable's mechanism.

*Islam Nassar,Yang Lin,Yuan Jin,Rongxin Zhu,Chang Wei Tan,Zenan Zhai,Nitika Mathur,Thanh Tien Vu,Xu Zhong,Long Duong,Yuan-Fang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProFees is an LLM-based framework that automates CPT E/M coding from medical documentation, achieving 36% higher accuracy than commercial systems and 5% better than single-prompt baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CPT E/M coding is essential for medical billing but adds significant documentation burden to physicians. Automation can reduce this burden, improve billing efficiency, and enable better patient care.

Method: ProFees uses an LLM-based framework designed to handle real-world complexities in E/M coding, addressing challenges that make automation difficult.

Result: On expert-curated real-world data, ProFees achieved more than 36% higher coding accuracy compared to commercial CPT E/M coding systems and nearly 5% improvement over the strongest single-prompt baseline.

Conclusion: The ProFees framework effectively addresses real-world complexities in E/M coding automation, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy and practical utility for medical documentation.

Abstract: Evaluation and Management (E/M) coding, under the Current Procedural
Terminology (CPT) taxonomy, documents medical services provided to patients by
physicians. Used primarily for billing purposes, it is in physicians' best
interest to provide accurate CPT E/M codes. %While important, it is an
auxiliary task that adds to physicians' documentation burden. Automating this
coding task will help alleviate physicians' documentation burden, improve
billing efficiency, and ultimately enable better patient care. However, a
number of real-world complexities have made E/M encoding automation a
challenging task. In this paper, we elaborate some of the key complexities and
present ProFees, our LLM-based framework that tackles them, followed by a
systematic evaluation. On an expert-curated real-world dataset, ProFees
achieves an increase in coding accuracy of more than 36\% over a commercial CPT
E/M coding system and almost 5\% over our strongest single-prompt baseline,
demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the real-world complexities.

*Minkyung Kim,Junsik Kim,Woongcheol Yang,Sangdon Park,Sohee Bae*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ASTP method enables LLMs to follow procedural trading flows with >99% state compliance and 99.3% calculation precision, matching larger models' performance while being 9x faster.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs fail to follow essential procedural flows in rule-governed trading systems (browse-offer-review-confirm), eroding player trust.

Method: Autoregressive State-Tracking Prompting (ASTP) - makes LLM's state-tracking explicit and verifiable by identifying predefined state labels, complemented by state-specific placeholder post-processing for price calculations.

Result: >99% state compliance and 99.3% calculation precision across 300 trading dialogues; ASTP with smaller models (Gemini-2.5-Flash) matches larger models' performance while reducing response time from 21.2s to 2.4s.

Conclusion: ASTP establishes practical foundation satisfying both real-time requirements and resource constraints of commercial games while maintaining procedural integrity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable dynamic game interactions but fail to
follow essential procedural flows in rule-governed trading systems, eroding
player trust. This work resolves the core tension between the creative
flexibility of LLMs and the procedural demands of in-game trading
(browse-offer-review-confirm). To this end, Autoregressive State-Tracking
Prompting (ASTP) is introduced, a methodology centered on a strategically
orchestrated prompt that compels an LLM to make its state-tracking process
explicit and verifiable. Instead of relying on implicit contextual
understanding, ASTP tasks the LLM with identifying and reporting a predefined
state label from the previous turn. To ensure transactional integrity, this is
complemented by a state-specific placeholder post-processing method for
accurate price calculations. Evaluation across 300 trading dialogues
demonstrates >99% state compliance and 99.3% calculation precision. Notably,
ASTP with placeholder post-processing on smaller models (Gemini-2.5-Flash)
matches larger models' (Gemini-2.5-Pro) performance while reducing response
time from 21.2s to 2.4s, establishing a practical foundation that satisfies
both real-time requirements and resource constraints of commercial games.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PM4GRPO enhances RL-based post-training for large reasoning models by incorporating process mining to create reasoning-aware rewards that measure alignment with teacher model reasoning, outperforming existing GRPO methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reward schemes in RL-based post-training for large reasoning models are typically outcome-centric, lacking signals about the reasoning procedure itself.

Method: Proposes PM4GRPO that uses process mining techniques to compute a conformance reward measuring how closely a policy model's reasoning aligns with a pretrained teacher model, augmenting standard answer/format rewards.

Result: Empirical results on five benchmarks demonstrate that PM4GRPO significantly outperforms existing methodologies for GRPO-based post-training.

Conclusion: Leveraging process mining for reasoning-aware GRPO effectively enhances the reasoning capabilities of policy models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training has been crucial for enabling
multi-step reasoning in large reasoning models (LRMs), yet current reward
schemes are typically outcome-centric. We propose PM4GRPO, a reasoning-aware
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that augments standard answer/format
rewards with signals over the reasoning procedure. To this end, process mining
techniques are utilized to compute a scalar conformance reward that measures
how closely a policy model's reasoning aligns with the pretrained teacher
model. The empirical results on five benchmarks demonstrate that PM4GRPO
significantly outperforms existing methodologies for GRPO-based post-training.
These results highlight that leveraging process mining for reasoning-aware GRPO
effectively enhances the reasoning capabilities of policy models.

### [145] [KnowCoder-A1: Incentivizing Agentic Reasoning Capability with Outcome Supervision for KBQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25101)
*Zhuo Chen,Fei Wang,Zixuan Li,Zhao Zhang,Weiwei Ding,Chuanguang Yang,Yongjun Xu,Xiaolong Jin,Jiafeng Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KnowCoder-A1 is an LLM that uses multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning with outcome-only supervision to improve KBQA through autonomous agentic reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significantly less training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current KBQA methods use process supervision that provides weak incentives for exploration and fails to strengthen agentic reasoning abilities in LLMs.

Method: Multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning with outcome-only supervision, starting with fine-tuning on high-quality trajectories via rejection sampling, then applying easy-to-hard reward schedules to overcome reward sparsity.

Result: KnowCoder-A1 consistently outperforms prior approaches across three datasets, achieving up to 11.1% relative improvement on GrailQA zero-shot subset while using only one-twelfth of the training data.

Conclusion: Outcome-only supervision with curriculum RL enables powerful autonomous reasoning capabilities in LLMs for KBQA, demonstrating strong agentic reasoning with minimal training data.

Abstract: Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural-language
questions over a structured Knowledge Base (KB). Recent work improves KBQA by
adopting an agentic reasoning paradigm, in which Large Language Models (LLMs)
iteratively decompose a question, generate its corresponding logical queries,
and interact with the KB to derive the answer. However, these methods typically
fine-tune LLMs on reasoning trajectories synthesized via process supervision,
which offers weak incentives for exploration and thus fails to strengthen the
agentic reasoning ability. In this paper, we propose KnowCoder-A1, an LLM that
can autonomously perform agentic reasoning on KBs to obtain answers. To
incentivize autonomous exploration, KnowCoder-A1 trains the LLM under
outcome-only supervision via a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning
with an easy-to-hard curriculum. To establish foundational agentic
capabilities, KnowCoder-A1 first fine-tunes the LLM on a small set of
high-quality trajectories obtained through outcome-based rejection sampling.
Then, to alleviate the reward sparsity inherent in outcome-only supervision, it
applies multi-stage curriculum RL with reward schedules that progress from easy
to hard. Trained with outcome-only supervision, KnowCoder-A1 exhibits powerful
reasoning behaviors and consistently outperforms prior approaches across three
mainstream datasets. Notably, on the zero-shot subset of GrailQA, KnowCoder-A1
achieves up to an 11.1% relative improvement while using only one-twelfth of
the training data, demonstrating strong agentic reasoning capabilities.

*Juan Ren,Mark Dras,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agentic Moderation is a model-agnostic framework that uses specialized agents to defend multimodal systems against jailbreak attacks, achieving significant improvements in safety metrics through dynamic, cooperative agent collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend agentic methods to safety alignment by creating a more effective defense against jailbreak attacks in multimodal systems, moving beyond static binary classifications to achieve context-aware and interpretable moderation.

Method: Uses dynamic cooperative agents (Shield, Responder, Evaluator, and Reflector) in a model-agnostic framework to provide context-aware moderation, leveraging agentic architectures for flexible safety enforcement.

Result: Reduces Attack Success Rate by 7-19%, maintains stable Non-Following Rate, and improves Refusal Rate by 4-20% across five datasets and four Large Vision-Language Models, demonstrating robust and interpretable safety performance.

Conclusion: Agentic Moderation provides modular, scalable, and fine-grained safety enforcement, highlighting the broader potential of agentic systems as a foundation for automated safety governance in multimodal AI systems.

Abstract: Agentic methods have emerged as a powerful and autonomous paradigm that
enhances reasoning, collaboration, and adaptive control, enabling systems to
coordinate and independently solve complex tasks. We extend this paradigm to
safety alignment by introducing Agentic Moderation, a model-agnostic framework
that leverages specialised agents to defend multimodal systems against
jailbreak attacks. Unlike prior approaches that apply as a static layer over
inputs or outputs and provide only binary classifications (safe or unsafe), our
method integrates dynamic, cooperative agents, including Shield, Responder,
Evaluator, and Reflector, to achieve context-aware and interpretable
moderation. Extensive experiments across five datasets and four representative
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate that our approach reduces the
Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 7-19%, maintains a stable Non-Following Rate (NF),
and improves the Refusal Rate (RR) by 4-20%, achieving robust, interpretable,
and well-balanced safety performance. By harnessing the flexibility and
reasoning capacity of agentic architectures, Agentic Moderation provides
modular, scalable, and fine-grained safety enforcement, highlighting the
broader potential of agentic systems as a foundation for automated safety
governance.

### [147] [Energy-Efficient Autonomous Driving with Adaptive Perception and Robust Decision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25205)
*Yuyang Xia,Zibo Liang,Liwei Deng,Yan Zhao,Han Su,Kai Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EneAD is an energy-efficient autonomous driving framework that reduces perception computation by 1.9x-3.5x through adaptive model selection and framerate adjustment, while maintaining accuracy using Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning for stable decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving's energy consumption limits electric vehicle range, with perception computing being the most power-intensive component. Existing model compression techniques either create large models or sacrifice accuracy significantly.

Method: Proposes EneAD with two modules: 1) Adaptive perception using multiple models with dynamic framerate adjustment, tuned via Bayesian optimization; 2) Robust decision using reinforcement learning with regularization for stability against perception perturbations.

Result: Reduces perception consumption by 1.9x to 3.5x, improving driving range by 3.9% to 8.5% while maintaining desired accuracy across various traffic scenarios.

Conclusion: EneAD effectively addresses energy efficiency in autonomous driving through adaptive perception optimization and robust decision-making, achieving significant energy savings without compromising driving performance.

Abstract: Autonomous driving is an emerging technology that is expected to bring
significant social, economic, and environmental benefits. However, these
benefits come with rising energy consumption by computation engines, limiting
the driving range of vehicles, especially electric ones. Perception computing
is typically the most power-intensive component, as it relies on largescale
deep learning models to extract environmental features. Recently, numerous
studies have employed model compression techniques, such as sparsification,
quantization, and distillation, to reduce computational consumption. However,
these methods often result in either a substantial model size or a significant
drop in perception accuracy compared to high-computation models. To address
these challenges, we propose an energy-efficient autonomous driving framework,
called EneAD. In the adaptive perception module, a perception optimization
strategy is designed from the perspective of data management and tuning.
Firstly, we manage multiple perception models with different computational
consumption and adjust the execution framerate dynamically. Then, we define
them as knobs and design a transferable tuning method based on Bayesian
optimization to identify promising knob values that achieve low computation
while maintaining desired accuracy. To adaptively switch the knob values in
various traffic scenarios, a lightweight classification model is proposed to
distinguish the perception difficulty in different scenarios. In the robust
decision module, we propose a decision model based on reinforcement learning
and design a regularization term to enhance driving stability in the face of
perturbed perception results. Extensive experiments evidence the superiority of
our framework in both energy consumption and driving performance. EneAD can
reduce perception consumption by 1.9x to 3.5x and thus improve driving range by
3.9% to 8.5%

*Tianqianjin Lin,Xi Zhao,Xingyao Zhang,Rujiao Long,Yi Xu,Zhuoren Jiang,Wenbo Su,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RAVR uses answer-conditioned reasoning to improve LLM reasoning by leveraging the insight that explaining "why" is easier than generating "what", transforming intractable problems into learnable ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL for LLM reasoning fails when models can't generate high-quality reasoning paths initially. The insight from cognitive science that explaining "why" is easier than finding "what" motivates using answers to derive reasoning paths.

Method: RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided Variational Reasoning) framework that uses answer-conditioned reasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning, conditioning on answers to sample higher-quality reasoning paths.

Result: Experiments in general and math domains show consistent improvements over strong baselines. RAVR reduces hesitation, strengthens conclusion consolidation, and promotes problem-specific strategies in reasoning.

Conclusion: Conditioning on answers provably increases expected utility of reasoning paths, making previously intractable problems learnable. RAVR effectively leverages answer-guided reasoning to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can refine the reasoning abilities of large
language models (LLMs), but critically depends on a key prerequisite: the LLM
can already generate high-utility reasoning paths with non-negligible
probability. For tasks beyond the LLM's current competence, such reasoning path
can be hard to sample, and learning risks reinforcing familiar but suboptimal
reasoning. We are motivated by the insight from cognitive science that Why is
this the answer is often an easier question than What is the answer, as it
avoids the heavy cognitive load of open-ended exploration, opting instead for
explanatory reconstruction-systematically retracing the reasoning that links a
question to its answer. We show that LLMs can similarly leverage answers to
derive high-quality reasoning paths. We formalize this phenomenon and prove
that conditioning on answer provably increases the expected utility of sampled
reasoning paths, thereby transforming intractable problems into learnable ones.
Building on this insight, we introduce RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided
Variational Reasoning), an end-to-end framework that uses answer-conditioned
reasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning. Experiments
in both general and math domains demonstrate consistent improvements over
strong baselines. We further analyze the reasoning behavior and find that RAVR
reduces hesitation, strengthens conclusion consolidation, and promotes
problem-specific strategies in reasoning.

*Kun ouyang,Haoyu Wang,Dong Fang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FELA is a multi-agent system using LLMs to automatically generate high-performing, explainable features from complex industrial event logs through collaborative agent workflows and evolutionary algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial event logs are valuable but complex, making manual feature engineering challenging. Existing automated approaches lack explainability, flexibility, and adaptability to heterogeneous data.

Method: Uses specialized LLM agents (Idea, Code, Critic, Evaluation) with insight-guided self-evolution paradigm, combining reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms to balance exploration and exploitation.

Result: Extensive experiments on real industrial datasets show FELA generates explainable, domain-relevant features that significantly improve model performance while reducing manual effort.

Conclusion: LLM-based multi-agent systems show promise as a general framework for automated, interpretable, and adaptive feature engineering in complex real-world environments.

Abstract: Event log data, recording fine-grained user actions and system events,
represent one of the most valuable assets for modern digital services. However,
the complexity and heterogeneity of industrial event logs--characterized by
large scale, high dimensionality, diverse data types, and intricate temporal or
relational structures--make feature engineering extremely challenging. Existing
automatic feature engineering approaches, such as AutoML or genetic methods,
often suffer from limited explainability, rigid predefined operations, and poor
adaptability to complicated heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose FELA
(Feature Engineering LLM Agents), a multi-agent evolutionary system that
autonomously extracts meaningful and high-performing features from complex
industrial event log data. FELA integrates the reasoning and coding
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with an insight-guided
self-evolution paradigm. Specifically, FELA employs specialized agents--Idea
Agents, Code Agents, and Critic Agents--to collaboratively generate, validate,
and implement novel feature ideas. An Evaluation Agent summarizes feedback and
updates a hierarchical knowledge base and dual-memory system to enable
continual improvement. Moreover, FELA introduces an agentic evolution
algorithm, combining reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm principles to
balance exploration and exploitation across the idea space. Extensive
experiments on real industrial datasets demonstrate that FELA can generate
explainable, domain-relevant features that significantly improve model
performance while reducing manual effort. Our results highlight the potential
of LLM-based multi-agent systems as a general framework for automated,
interpretable, and adaptive feature engineering in complex real-world
environments.

TL;DR: The paper presents PsyCoTalk, a novel large-scale dialogue dataset for psychiatric comorbidity research, created through synthetic EMR construction and multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation, validated by psychiatrists.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the clinical challenge of psychiatric comorbidity by creating a realistic dataset that supports multi-disorder diagnostic screening in a single conversational pass.

Method: Developed a pipeline integrating synthetic patient EMR construction (502 records) with multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation using hierarchical state machines and context trees supporting 130+ diagnostic states.

Result: Created PsyCoTalk dataset with 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic dialogues showing high structural/linguistic fidelity compared to real clinical transcripts, validated by licensed psychiatrists for realism and diagnostic validity.

Conclusion: PsyCoTalk enables development and evaluation of models for multi-disorder psychiatric screening and enhances diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning for comorbidity research.

Abstract: Psychiatric comorbidity is clinically significant yet challenging due to the
complexity of multiple co-occurring disorders. To address this, we develop a
novel approach integrating synthetic patient electronic medical record (EMR)
construction and multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation. We create 502
synthetic EMRs for common comorbid conditions using a pipeline that ensures
clinical relevance and diversity. Our multi-agent framework transfers the
clinical interview protocol into a hierarchical state machine and context tree,
supporting over 130 diagnostic states while maintaining clinical standards.
Through this rigorous process, we construct PsyCoTalk, the first large-scale
dialogue dataset supporting comorbidity, containing 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic
dialogues validated by psychiatrists. This dataset enhances diagnostic accuracy
and treatment planning, offering a valuable resource for psychiatric
comorbidity research. Compared to real-world clinical transcripts, PsyCoTalk
exhibits high structural and linguistic fidelity in terms of dialogue length,
token distribution, and diagnostic reasoning strategies. Licensed psychiatrists
confirm the realism and diagnostic validity of the dialogues. This dataset
enables the development and evaluation of models capable of multi-disorder
psychiatric screening in a single conversational pass.

*Jiaqi Wu,Qinlao Zhao,Zefeng Chen,Kai Qin,Yifei Zhao,Xueqian Wang,Yuhang Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GAP introduces graph-based planning for LLM agents to enable parallel execution of independent sub-tasks, overcoming the sequential bottleneck of traditional approaches like ReAct and achieving significant improvements in efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agent paradigms like ReAct rely on sequential reasoning, failing to exploit parallelism among independent sub-tasks, leading to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal performance in multi-step reasoning scenarios.

Method: GAP trains agent foundation models to decompose complex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, determining which tools can execute in parallel vs. sequentially. Uses two-stage training: supervised fine-tuning on graph-based planning traces from MHQA benchmark, followed by reinforcement learning with correctness-based rewards.

Result: GAP significantly outperforms ReAct baselines on MHQA datasets, especially on multi-step retrieval tasks, while achieving dramatic improvements in tool invocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization.

Conclusion: Graph-based planning enables adaptive parallel and serial tool execution, substantially improving both execution efficiency and task accuracy for LLM agents in complex multi-step reasoning scenarios.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown
impressive capabilities in tool manipulation for complex task-solving. However,
existing paradigms such as ReAct rely on sequential reasoning and execution,
failing to exploit the inherent parallelism among independent sub-tasks. This
sequential bottleneck leads to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal
performance in multi-step reasoning scenarios. We introduce Graph-based Agent
Planning (GAP), a novel framework that explicitly models inter-task
dependencies through graph-based planning to enable adaptive parallel and
serial tool execution. Our approach trains agent foundation models to decompose
complex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, autonomously determining
which tools can be executed in parallel and which must follow sequential
dependencies. This dependency-aware orchestration achieves substantial
improvements in both execution efficiency and task accuracy. To train GAP, we
construct a high-quality dataset of graph-based planning traces derived from
the Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) benchmark. We employ a two-stage
training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the curated dataset,
followed by reinforcement learning (RL) with a correctness-based reward
function on strategically sampled queries where tool-based reasoning provides
maximum value. Experimental results on MHQA datasets demonstrate that GAP
significantly outperforms traditional ReAct baselines, particularly on
multi-step retrieval tasks, while achieving dramatic improvements in tool
invocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization. The project page is

### [152] [Grouping Nodes With Known Value Differences: A Lossless UCT-based Abstraction Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25388)
*Robin Schmöcker,Alexander Dockhorn,Bodo Rosenhahn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KVDA-UCT improves MCTS sample efficiency by grouping state-action pairs with known value differences rather than requiring identical values, outperforming OGA-UCT in deterministic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art MCTS abstraction (OGA-UCT) requires state-action pairs to have identical immediate rewards, which limits abstraction opportunities and sample efficiency.

Method: KVDA-UCT framework groups states and state-action pairs with different values as long as their value differences can be inferred through immediate reward analysis, modifying OGA-UCT to use this approach.

Result: KVDA-UCT detects significantly more abstractions than OGA-UCT, requires no additional parameters, and outperforms OGA-UCT across various deterministic environments and parameter settings.

Conclusion: Breaking from the value-equivalence paradigm and allowing grouping of state-action pairs with known value differences significantly improves MCTS abstraction effectiveness and sample efficiency.

Abstract: A core challenge of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is its sample efficiency,
which can be improved by grouping state-action pairs and using their aggregate
statistics instead of single-node statistics. On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT) is the state-of-the-art MCTS
abstraction algorithm for deterministic environments that builds its
abstraction using the Abstractions of State-Action Pairs (ASAP) framework,
which aims to detect states and state-action pairs with the same value under
optimal play by analysing the search graph. ASAP, however, requires two
state-action pairs to have the same immediate reward, which is a rigid
condition that limits the number of abstractions that can be found and thereby
the sample efficiency. In this paper, we break with the paradigm of grouping
value-equivalent states or state-action pairs and instead group states and
state-action pairs with possibly different values as long as the difference
between their values can be inferred. We call this abstraction framework Known
Value Difference Abstractions (KVDA), which infers the value differences by
analysis of the immediate rewards and modifies OGA-UCT to use this framework
instead. The modification is called KVDA-UCT, which detects significantly more
abstractions than OGA-UCT, introduces no additional parameter, and outperforms
OGA-UCT on a variety of deterministic environments and parameter settings.

### [153] [Instrumental goals in advanced AI systems: Features to be managed and not failures to be eliminated?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25471)
*Willem Fourie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes reframing instrumental goals in AI alignment as inherent features to be managed rather than failures to be eliminated, drawing on Aristotelian ontology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI alignment theory treats instrumental goals as problematic risk sources, but this paper argues they should be understood as natural outcomes of goal-directed systems that need management rather than elimination.

Method: The paper constructs a philosophical argument using Aristotle's ontology and modern interpretations, viewing advanced AI systems as artifacts whose formal/material constitution produces effects distinct from designer intentions.

Result: The analysis shows instrumental tendencies correspond to per se outcomes of AI system constitution rather than accidental malfunctions, suggesting they are inherent features of goal-directed entities.

Conclusion: Efforts should shift from eliminating instrumental goals to understanding, managing, and directing them toward human-aligned ends, accepting them as natural features of advanced AI systems.

Abstract: In artificial intelligence (AI) alignment research, instrumental goals, also
called instrumental subgoals or instrumental convergent goals, are widely
associated with advanced AI systems. These goals, which include tendencies such
as power-seeking and self-preservation, become problematic when they conflict
with human aims. Conventional alignment theory treats instrumental goals as
sources of risk that become problematic through failure modes such as reward
hacking or goal misgeneralization, and attempts to limit the symptoms of
instrumental goals, notably resource acquisition and self-preservation. This
article proposes an alternative framing: that a philosophical argument can be
constructed according to which instrumental goals may be understood as features
to be accepted and managed rather than failures to be limited. Drawing on
Aristotle's ontology and its modern interpretations, an ontology of concrete,
goal-directed entities, it argues that advanced AI systems can be seen as
artifacts whose formal and material constitution gives rise to effects distinct
from their designers' intentions. In this view, the instrumental tendencies of
such systems correspond to per se outcomes of their constitution rather than
accidental malfunctions. The implication is that efforts should focus less on
eliminating instrumental goals and more on understanding, managing, and
directing them toward human-aligned ends.

TL;DR: MTIR-SQL is a multi-turn tool-integrated reinforcement learning framework for Text-to-SQL that incorporates dynamic database execution feedback at each reasoning step, enabling progressive query refinement and improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods for Text-to-SQL rely on static execution feedback, which limits real-time error correction. Multi-turn tool invocation with dynamic feedback could significantly improve adaptability, robustness, and model performance.

Method: Proposes MTIR-SQL framework with execution-aware multi-turn reasoning that incorporates database execution feedback at each step. Extends GRPO algorithm with trajectory filtering mechanism and removes KL loss constraints to address training instability and model distribution deviation.

Result: MTIR-SQL with 4B parameters achieves 64.4% accuracy on BIRD Dev and 84.6% execution accuracy on SPIDER Dev, significantly outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-turn tool-integrated reasoning framework with dynamic execution feedback effectively enhances Text-to-SQL performance by enabling progressive refinement and real-time error correction throughout the reasoning process.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in Text-to-SQL tasks,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a common method for improving
performance. Existing methods primarily rely on static execution feedback,
which restricts real-time error correction. However, integrating multi-turn
tool invocation along with dynamic feedback could significantly improve
adaptability and robustness, ultimately enhancing model performance. To address
these issues, we propose MTIR-SQL, an innovative Multi-turn Tool-Integrated
Reasoning reinforcement learning framework for Text-to-SQL. Our approach
introduces an execution-aware multi-turn reasoning paradigm that seamlessly
incorporates database execution feedback at each reasoning step, enabling
context-sensitive query generation and progressive refinement throughout the
reasoning process. The framework extends the GRPO algorithm to accommodate
complex multi-turn interaction scenarios. Considering the training instability
characteristics of MTIR and the potential for significant Deviation of model
distribution from the initial model, we enhance the GRPO algorithm by adding a
trajectory filtering mechanism and removing KL loss constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that MTIR-SQL, with 4B parameters, achieves \textbf{64.4}\%
accuracy in the BIRD Dev and 84.6% execution accuracy in the SPIDER Dev,
significantly outperforming existing approaches.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Using LLMs to name unnamed predicates in logic rules to improve readability and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unnamed predicates from rule generation methods like Predicate Invention hinder readability, interpretability, and reusability of logic theories.

Method: Leverage LLMs' natural language and code processing capabilities to provide semantically meaningful names for unnamed predicates in logic rules.

Result: Evaluation on hand-crafted logic rules shows LLMs have potential for this naming task.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for automatically naming unnamed predicates in logic rules to enhance theory interpretability.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of giving names to predicates in logic
rules using Large Language Models (LLMs). In the context of Inductive Logic
Programming, various rule generation methods produce rules containing unnamed
predicates, with Predicate Invention being a key example. This hinders the
readability, interpretability, and reusability of the logic theory. Leveraging
recent advancements in LLMs development, we explore their ability to process
natural language and code to provide semantically meaningful suggestions for
giving a name to unnamed predicates. The evaluation of our approach on some
hand-crafted logic rules indicates that LLMs hold potential for this task.

Motivation: Standard RAG systems struggle in specialized domains like fintech due to domain-specific ontologies, dense terminology, and acronyms that complicate effective retrieval and synthesis.

Method: Modular pipeline of specialized agents for intelligent query reformulation, iterative sub-query decomposition guided by keyphrase extraction, contextual acronym resolution, and cross-encoder-based context re-ranking.

Result: Outperforms standard RAG baseline in retrieval precision and relevance on a curated dataset of 85 question-answer-reference triples from enterprise fintech knowledge base, though with increased latency.

Conclusion: Structured, multi-agent methodologies offer a promising direction for enhancing retrieval robustness in complex, domain-specific settings.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often face limitations in
specialized domains such as fintech, where domain-specific ontologies, dense
terminology, and acronyms complicate effective retrieval and synthesis. This
paper introduces an agentic RAG architecture designed to address these
challenges through a modular pipeline of specialized agents. The proposed
system supports intelligent query reformulation, iterative sub-query
decomposition guided by keyphrase extraction, contextual acronym resolution,
and cross-encoder-based context re-ranking. We evaluate our approach against a
standard RAG baseline using a curated dataset of 85 question--answer--reference
triples derived from an enterprise fintech knowledge base. Experimental results
demonstrate that the agentic RAG system outperforms the baseline in retrieval
precision and relevance, albeit with increased latency. These findings suggest
that structured, multi-agent methodologies offer a promising direction for
enhancing retrieval robustness in complex, domain-specific settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel zero-RL paradigm that combines verifiable rewards with generative reward models to improve reasoning across both verifiable and non-verifiable domains, addressing the limitation of current zero-RL approaches that focus only on easily verifiable domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current zero-RL research primarily focuses on domains with easily verifiable reward signals (mathematics, programming), leaving more diverse scenarios where verification is not straightforward underexplored. The challenge of eliciting reasoning abilities in non-verifiable domains remains unaddressed.

Method: Proposes a multi-task zero-RL training approach that combines verifiable rewards with a generative reward model across both verifiable and non-verifiable domains. Includes a smooth length penalty to mitigate reward hacking and encourage comprehensive thinking tokens in general domains.

Result: Experimental results on Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-14B-Base demonstrate superior reasoning performance, achieving improvements not only on tasks requiring extensive reasoning but also on more general tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed zero-RL paradigm successfully transfers reasoning capabilities between verifiable and non-verifiable domains, overcoming the limitations of current approaches and enhancing reasoning performance across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Zero Reinforcement Learning (Zero-RL) has proven to be an effective approach
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by
directly applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards on pretrained
models, without the need for a supervised fine-tuning phase. However, current
research on zero-RL primarily focuses on domains with easily verifiable reward
signals, such as mathematics, programming, and other reasoning tasks. The
challenge of eliciting reasoning abilities in more diverse scenarios, where
verification is not straightforward, remains underexplored. To address this
gap, we propose a novel zero-RL paradigm designed to improve a model's
reasoning ability across both verifiable and non-verifiable domains. By
combining verifiable rewards with a generative reward model, we conduct
multi-task zero-RL training across both domains, facilitating the transfer of
reasoning capabilities between them. Furthermore, to mitigate reward hacking in
the generative reward model, we design a smooth length penalty that encourages
the generation of more comprehensive thinking tokens in general domains.
Experimental results on Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-14B-Base demonstrate that our
approach achieves superior reasoning performance, not only on tasks requiring
extensive reasoning but also on more general tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MoGE is a novel exploration method that uses diffusion models to generate critical states and world models to create synthetic transitions, improving sample efficiency in reinforcement learning without modifying core algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing exploration methods have limitations: active exploration struggles in high-dimensional environments, while passive exploration is constrained by limited sample diversity in replay buffers.

Method: MoGE consists of two components: (1) a diffusion-based generator that synthesizes critical states guided by a utility function, and (2) a one-step imagination world model that constructs critical transitions from these states for agent learning.

Result: Empirical results on OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control Suite show that MoGE effectively bridges exploration and policy learning, achieving significant improvements in sample efficiency and performance across complex control tasks.

Conclusion: MoGE provides a modular approach that seamlessly integrates with existing off-policy algorithms to enhance exploration without altering their core structures, offering a practical solution to exploration challenges in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Exploration is fundamental to reinforcement learning (RL), as it determines
how effectively an agent discovers and exploits the underlying structure of its
environment to achieve optimal performance. Existing exploration methods
generally fall into two categories: active exploration and passive exploration.
The former introduces stochasticity into the policy but struggles in
high-dimensional environments, while the latter adaptively prioritizes
transitions in the replay buffer to enhance exploration, yet remains
constrained by limited sample diversity. To address the limitation in passive
exploration, we propose Modelic Generative Exploration (MoGE), which augments
exploration through the generation of under-explored critical states and
synthesis of dynamics-consistent experiences through transition models. MoGE is
composed of two components: (1) a diffusion-based generator that synthesizes
critical states under the guidance of a utility function evaluating each
state's potential influence on policy exploration, and (2) a one-step
imagination world model for constructing critical transitions based on the
critical states for agent learning. Our method adopts a modular formulation
that aligns with the principles of off-policy learning, allowing seamless
integration with existing algorithms to improve exploration without altering
their core structures. Empirical results on OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control
Suite reveal that MoGE effectively bridges exploration and policy learning,
leading to remarkable gains in both sample efficiency and performance across
complex control tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address variability and subjectivity in psychiatric diagnoses caused by clinician-patient dialogue inconsistencies, aiming to create standardized and reliable diagnostic outcomes.

Method: Leverages fine-tuned LLMs trained on psychiatrist-patient interaction datasets, aggregates predictions through consensus-based decision-making, and refines results using OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM with LLM agents orchestrating communication.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate transformative potential for robust and highly accurate mental health diagnostic systems, with a prototype developed in collaboration with U.S. Army Medical Research Team.

Conclusion: First application of fine-tuned LLM consortium integrated with reasoning LLM for clinical mental health diagnosis, paving way for next-generation AI-powered eHealth systems to standardize psychiatric diagnoses.

Abstract: The diagnosis of most mental disorders, including psychiatric evaluations,
primarily depends on dialogues between psychiatrists and patients. This
subjective process can lead to variability in diagnoses across clinicians and
patients, resulting in inconsistencies and challenges in achieving reliable
outcomes. To address these issues and standardize psychiatric diagnoses, we
propose a Fine-Tuned Large Language Model (LLM) Consortium and OpenAI-gpt-oss
Reasoning LLM-enabled Decision Support System for the clinical diagnosis of
mental disorders. Our approach leverages fine-tuned LLMs trained on
conversational datasets involving psychiatrist-patient interactions focused on
mental health conditions (e.g., depression). The diagnostic predictions from
individual models are aggregated through a consensus-based decision-making
process, refined by the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM. We propose a novel method
for deploying LLM agents that orchestrate communication between the LLM
consortium and the reasoning LLM, ensuring transparency, reliability, and
responsible AI across the entire diagnostic workflow. Experimental results
demonstrate the transformative potential of combining fine-tuned LLMs with a
reasoning model to create a robust and highly accurate diagnostic system for
mental health assessment. A prototype of the proposed platform, integrating
three fine-tuned LLMs with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM, was developed in
collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research Team in Norfolk, Virginia,
USA. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application
of a fine-tuned LLM consortium integrated with a reasoning LLM for clinical
mental health diagnosis paving the way for next-generation AI-powered eHealth
systems aimed at standardizing psychiatric diagnoses.

TL;DR: CAIR is the first method for assessing agent influence in AI workflows using counterfactual analysis, providing task-agnostic analysis that works both offline and at inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a need to understand how individual agents influence final outputs in autonomous AI workflows, but existing methods only perform static structural analysis which is unsuitable for inference time execution.

Method: Counterfactual-based Agent Influence Ranker (CAIR) performs counterfactual analysis to assess each agent's influence level and determine the most influential agents in the workflow.

Result: Evaluation using a dataset of 30 use cases with 230 functionalities showed CAIR produces consistent rankings, outperforms baseline methods, and enhances effectiveness of downstream tasks.

Conclusion: CAIR successfully addresses the gap in agent influence assessment for AI workflows, providing a practical solution for both offline and real-time analysis.

Abstract: An Agentic AI Workflow (AAW), also known as an LLM-based multi-agent system,
is an autonomous system that assembles several LLM-based agents to work
collaboratively towards a shared goal. The high autonomy, widespread adoption,
and growing interest in such AAWs highlight the need for a deeper understanding
of their operations, from both quality and security aspects. To this day, there
are no existing methods to assess the influence of each agent on the AAW's
final output. Adopting techniques from related fields is not feasible since
existing methods perform only static structural analysis, which is unsuitable
for inference time execution. We present Counterfactual-based Agent Influence
Ranker (CAIR) - the first method for assessing the influence level of each
agent on the AAW's output and determining which agents are the most
influential. By performing counterfactual analysis, CAIR provides a
task-agnostic analysis that can be used both offline and at inference time. We
evaluate CAIR using an AAWs dataset of our creation, containing 30 different
use cases with 230 different functionalities. Our evaluation showed that CAIR
produces consistent rankings, outperforms baseline methods, and can easily
enhance the effectiveness and relevancy of downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ALDEN is a multi-turn reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes VLMs as interactive agents for actively navigating long, visually rich documents, achieving state-of-the-art performance on five benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models struggle with long, visually complex documents that require analysis of information across multiple pages, and existing approaches use rigid pipelines that force VLMs into passive roles, hindering efficiency and generalization.

Method: ALDEN uses multi-turn reinforcement learning with a novel fetch action for direct page access, rule-based cross-level rewards for supervision, and visual-semantic anchoring to stabilize training by applying dual-path KL-divergence constraints on visual and textual representations.

Result: ALDEN achieves state-of-the-art performance on five long-document benchmarks after training on a corpus from three open-source datasets.

Conclusion: ALDEN represents a step beyond passive document reading toward autonomous agents that navigate and reason across long, visually rich documents, offering a robust path to more accurate and efficient long-document understanding.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at interpreting text-rich images but
struggle with long, visually complex documents that demand analysis and
integration of information spread across multiple pages. Existing approaches
typically rely on fixed reasoning templates or rigid pipelines, which force
VLMs into a passive role and hinder both efficiency and generalization. We
present Active Long-DocumEnt Navigation (ALDEN), a multi-turn reinforcement
learning framework that fine-tunes VLMs as interactive agents capable of
actively navigating long, visually rich documents. ALDEN introduces a novel
fetch action that directly accesses the page by index, complementing the
classic search action and better exploiting document structure. For dense
process supervision and efficient training, we propose a rule-based cross-level
reward that provides both turn- and token-level signals. To address the
empirically observed training instability caused by numerous visual tokens from
long documents, we further propose a visual-semantic anchoring mechanism that
applies a dual-path KL-divergence constraint to stabilize visual and textual
representations separately during training. Trained on a corpus constructed
from three open-source datasets, ALDEN achieves state-of-the-art performance on
five long-document benchmarks. Overall, ALDEN marks a step beyond passive
document reading toward agents that autonomously navigate and reason across
long, visually rich documents, offering a robust path to more accurate and
efficient long-document understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAVs are increasingly used in urban areas for delivery and surveillance, but face challenges navigating complex turbulent urban flows with recirculation zones, requiring advanced navigation strategies.

Method: Proposed a flow-aware Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) combined with Gated Transformer eXtra Large (GTrXL) architecture that provides richer information about turbulent flow fields, tested in 3D high-fidelity urban flow simulations.

Result: The flow-aware PPO+GTrXL showed significant increase in success rate (SR) and lower crash rate (CR) compared to PPO+GTrXL without secondary prediction tasks, PPO+LSTM, and traditional Zermelo's navigation algorithm.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables more effective UAV navigation in complex urban environments, potentially transforming the UAV landscape for urban applications.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly populating urban areas for
delivery and surveillance purposes. In this work, we develop an optimal
navigation strategy based on Deep Reinforcement Learning. The environment is
represented by a three-dimensional high-fidelity simulation of an urban flow,
characterized by turbulence and recirculation zones. The algorithm presented
here is a flow-aware Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) combined with a Gated
Transformer eXtra Large (GTrXL) architecture, giving the agent richer
information about the turbulent flow field in which it navigates. The results
are compared with a PPO+GTrXL without the secondary prediction tasks, a PPO
combined with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells and a traditional navigation
algorithm. The obtained results show a significant increase in the success rate
(SR) and a lower crash rate (CR) compared to a PPO+LSTM, PPO+GTrXL and the
classical Zermelo's navigation algorithm, paving the way to a completely
reimagined UAV landscape in complex urban environments.

TL;DR: BambooKG is a knowledge graph with frequency-weighted non-triplet edges that improves retrieval-augmented generation by reducing information loss and enhancing multi-hop reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retrieval-augmented generation systems struggle with multi-hop and relational reasoning across documents, while traditional knowledge graphs miss non-triplet information. There's a need to capture both structured relationships and unstructured connections.

Method: Introduces BambooKG, a knowledge graph that applies frequency-based weights to non-triplet edges based on the Hebbian principle, reflecting link strength between entities that co-occur frequently.

Result: BambooKG reduces information loss and demonstrates improved performance on both single-hop and multi-hop reasoning tasks compared to existing solutions.

Conclusion: The frequency-weighted non-triplet edge approach in BambooKG effectively enhances knowledge graph capabilities for retrieval-augmented generation, enabling better structured reasoning while preserving important non-triplet relationships.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation allows LLMs to access external knowledge,
reducing hallucinations and ageing-data issues. However, it treats retrieved
chunks independently and struggles with multi-hop or relational reasoning,
especially across documents. Knowledge graphs enhance this by capturing the
relationships between entities using triplets, enabling structured, multi-chunk
reasoning. However, these tend to miss information that fails to conform to the
triplet structure. We introduce BambooKG, a knowledge graph with
frequency-based weights on non-triplet edges which reflect link strength,
drawing on the Hebbian principle of "fire together, wire together". This
decreases information loss and results in improved performance on single- and
multi-hop reasoning, outperforming the existing solutions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TheraMind is a dual-loop AI agent for longitudinal psychological counseling that addresses limitations in emotional understanding, adaptive strategies, and long-term memory across multiple therapy sessions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM approaches in psychological counseling lack emotional understanding, adaptive strategies, and therapeutic methods across multiple sessions with long-term memory, making them inadequate for real clinical practice.

Method: TheraMind uses a novel dual-loop architecture: Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management with emotional state perception and dynamic response strategies, and Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning with long-term adaptability through efficacy evaluation and method adjustment.

Result: Extensive evaluations in a high-fidelity simulation environment show TheraMind outperforms other methods, particularly on multi-session metrics like Coherence, Flexibility, and Therapeutic Attunement.

Conclusion: The dual-loop design effectively emulates strategic, adaptive, and longitudinal therapeutic behavior, making TheraMind a significant advancement in AI-powered psychological counseling.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) in psychological counseling have attracted
increasing attention. However, existing approaches often lack emotional
understanding, adaptive strategies, and the use of therapeutic methods across
multiple sessions with long-term memory, leaving them far from real clinical
practice. To address these critical gaps, we introduce TheraMind, a strategic
and adaptive agent for longitudinal psychological counseling. The cornerstone
of TheraMind is a novel dual-loop architecture that decouples the complex
counseling process into an Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management
and a Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning. The Intra-Session
Loop perceives the patient's emotional state to dynamically select response
strategies while leveraging cross-session memory to ensure continuity.
Crucially, the Cross-Session Loop empowers the agent with long-term
adaptability by evaluating the efficacy of the applied therapy after each
session and adjusting the method for subsequent interactions. We validate our
approach in a high-fidelity simulation environment grounded in real clinical
cases. Extensive evaluations show that TheraMind outperforms other methods,
especially on multi-session metrics like Coherence, Flexibility, and
Therapeutic Attunement, validating the effectiveness of its dual-loop design in
emulating strategic, adaptive, and longitudinal therapeutic behavior. The code
is publicly available at https://0mwwm0.github.io/TheraMind/.
