### [1] [Iti-Validator: A Guardrail Framework for Validating and Correcting LLM-Generated Itineraries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24719)
*Shravan Gadbail,Masumi Desai,Kamalakar Karlapalem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a validation framework to evaluate and improve temporal consistency in LLM-generated travel itineraries, addressing issues like overlapping journeys and unrealistic transit times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate travel plans lacking temporal and spatial consistency, particularly with physical travel constraints, which limits their practical deployment in travel planning.

Method: The system uses multiple state-of-the-art LLMs to generate travel plans and validates them against real-world flight duration constraints using the AeroDataBox API to detect and correct temporal inconsistencies.

Result: Experiments show current LLMs frequently produce temporally inconsistent itineraries, but these can be systematically and reliably corrected using the proposed framework.

Conclusion: The framework enables practical deployment of LLMs in large-scale travel planning by systematically rectifying temporal inconsistencies in generated itineraries.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled them to
generate complex, multi-step plans and itineraries. However, these generated
plans often lack temporal and spatial consistency, particularly in scenarios
involving physical travel constraints. This research aims to study the temporal
performance of different LLMs and presents a validation framework that
evaluates and improves the temporal consistency of LLM-generated travel
itineraries. The system employs multiple state-of-the-art LLMs to generate
travel plans and validates them against real-world flight duration constraints
using the AeroDataBox API. This work contributes to the understanding of LLM
capabilities in handling complex temporal reasoning tasks like itinerary
generation and provides a framework to rectify any temporal inconsistencies
like overlapping journeys or unrealistic transit times in the itineraries
generated by LLMs before the itinerary is given to the user. Our experiments
reveal that while current LLMs frequently produce temporally inconsistent
itineraries, these can be systematically and reliably corrected using our
framework, enabling their practical deployment in large-scale travel planning.

### [3] [Falcon: A Comprehensive Chinese Text-to-SQL Benchmark for Enterprise-Grade Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24762)
*Wenzhen Luo,Wei Guan,Yifan Yao,Yimin Pan,Feng Wang,Zhipeng Yu,Zhe Wen,Liang Chen,Yihong Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Falcon is a Chinese text-to-SQL benchmark with 600 questions over 28 databases, focusing on enterprise-compatible dialects and Chinese semantics. Current state-of-the-art models achieve at most 50% accuracy, with major challenges in schema linking and mapping colloquial Chinese to precise SQL operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in cross-domain Chinese text-to-SQL evaluation, particularly for enterprise environments with complex schemas, denormalized fields, ambiguous column names, and domain-specific synonyms that make schema linking and SQL generation challenging.

Method: Created a benchmark with 600 Chinese questions across 28 databases, with 77% requiring multi-table reasoning. Each example is annotated with SQL-computation features and Chinese semantics. Includes a robust execution comparator and automated evaluation pipeline.

Result: All current state-of-the-art large-scale models (including Deepseek) achieve accuracies of at most 50%. Major errors come from schema linking in complex enterprise landscapes and mapping colloquial Chinese to exact SQL operators and predicates.

Conclusion: Falcon provides a reproducible middle ground for testing Chinese text-to-SQL systems before production deployment, targeting Chinese-specific semantics and enterprise dialects with realistic schemas, query templates, and evaluation tools.

Abstract: We introduce Falcon, a cross-domain Chinese text-to-SQL benchmark grounded in
an enterprise-compatible dialect (MaxCompute/Hive). It contains 600 Chinese
questions over 28 databases; 77% require multi-table reasoning and over half
touch more than four tables. Each example is annotated along SQL-computation
features and Chinese semantics. For evaluation, we release a robust execution
comparator and an automated evaluation pipeline, under which all current
state-of-the-art large-scale models (including Deepseek) achieve accuracies of
at most 50%. Major errors originate from two sources: (1) schema linking in
large enterprise landscapes - hundreds of tables, denormalized fields,
ambiguous column names, implicit foreign-key relations and domain-specific
synonyms that make correct join/column selection difficult; and (2) mapping
concise, colloquial Chinese into the exact operators and predicates required
for analytics - e.g., choosing the correct aggregation and group-by keys,
expressing time windows and granularities, applying unit conversions, handling
NULLs and data-quality rules, and formulating nested or windowed subqueries.
Falcon therefore targets Chinese-specific semantics and enterprise dialects
(abbreviations, business jargon, fuzzy entity references) and provides a
reproducible middle ground before full production deployment by using realistic
enterprise schemas, query templates, an execution comparator, and an automated
evaluation pipeline for end-to-end validation.

### [4] [Confidence is Not Competence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24772)
*Debdeep Sanyal,Manya Pandey,Dhruv Kumar,Saurabh Deshpande,Murari Mandal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show a confidence-competence gap where their internal "solvability belief" is linearly decodable but doesn't control actual problem-solving execution, revealing a two-system architecture with complex assessment and simple execution manifolds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanistic basis for why large language models often display a disconnect between their asserted confidence and actual problem-solving competence.

Method: Analyzed internal state geometry across pre-generative assessment and solution execution phases using linear probes, measured manifold dimensionality, and performed causal interventions along the belief axis.

Result: Found that belief is linearly decodable across model families and tasks, but assessment occurs in high-dimensional space while execution evolves in low-dimensional space. Interventions along belief axis don't change final solutions.

Conclusion: LLMs have a two-system architecture with geometrically complex assessment feeding geometrically simple execution, challenging the notion that decodable beliefs are actionable levers for controlling model behavior.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit a puzzling disconnect between
their asserted confidence and actual problem-solving competence. We offer a
mechanistic account of this decoupling by analyzing the geometry of internal
states across two phases - pre-generative assessment and solution execution. A
simple linear probe decodes the internal "solvability belief" of a model,
revealing a well-ordered belief axis that generalizes across model families and
across math, code, planning, and logic tasks. Yet, the geometries diverge -
although belief is linearly decodable, the assessment manifold has high linear
effective dimensionality as measured from the principal components, while the
subsequent reasoning trace evolves on a much lower-dimensional manifold. This
sharp reduction in geometric complexity from thought to action mechanistically
explains the confidence-competence gap. Causal interventions that steer
representations along the belief axis leave final solutions unchanged,
indicating that linear nudges in the complex assessment space do not control
the constrained dynamics of execution. We thus uncover a two-system
architecture - a geometrically complex assessor feeding a geometrically simple
executor. These results challenge the assumption that decodable beliefs are
actionable levers, instead arguing for interventions that target the procedural
dynamics of execution rather than the high-level geometry of assessment.

### [5] [Cross-Lingual Summarization as a Black-Box Watermark Removal Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24789)
*Gokul Ganesan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cross-lingual summarization attacks (CLSA) effectively remove watermarks from AI-generated text by translating to a pivot language, summarizing, and optionally back-translating, while preserving semantic quality and reducing detection accuracy to near-chance levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that existing watermarking schemes for AI-generated text are vulnerable to cross-lingual attacks that systematically destroy token-level statistical biases while maintaining semantic fidelity.

Method: Propose CLSA attack: translate text to a pivot language, summarize it, and optionally back-translate to original language, creating a semantic bottleneck that removes watermark signals.

Result: CLSA reduces watermark detection accuracy more effectively than monolingual paraphrasing across multiple watermarking schemes (KGW, SIR, XSIR, Unigram) and five languages, driving detection AUROC to near-chance levels (0.53 for XSIR).

Conclusion: Current distributional watermarking is insufficient for robust provenance; future solutions should incorporate cryptographic or model-attestation approaches to address this cross-lingual vulnerability.

Abstract: Watermarking has been proposed as a lightweight mechanism to identify
AI-generated text, with schemes typically relying on perturbations to token
distributions. While prior work shows that paraphrasing can weaken such
signals, these attacks remain partially detectable or degrade text quality. We
demonstrate that cross-lingual summarization attacks (CLSA) -- translation to a
pivot language followed by summarization and optional back-translation --
constitute a qualitatively stronger attack vector. By forcing a semantic
bottleneck across languages, CLSA systematically destroys token-level
statistical biases while preserving semantic fidelity. In experiments across
multiple watermarking schemes (KGW, SIR, XSIR, Unigram) and five languages
(Amharic, Chinese, Hindi, Spanish, Swahili), we show that CLSA reduces
watermark detection accuracy more effectively than monolingual paraphrase at
similar quality levels. Our results highlight an underexplored vulnerability
that challenges the practicality of watermarking for provenance or regulation.
We argue that robust provenance solutions must move beyond distributional
watermarking and incorporate cryptographic or model-attestation approaches. On
300 held-out samples per language, CLSA consistently drives detection toward
chance while preserving task utility. Concretely, for XSIR (explicitly designed
for cross-lingual robustness), AUROC with paraphrasing is $0.827$, with
Cross-Lingual Watermark Removal Attacks (CWRA) [He et al., 2024] using Chinese
as the pivot, it is $0.823$, whereas CLSA drives it down to $0.53$ (near
chance). Results highlight a practical, low-cost removal pathway that crosses
languages and compresses content without visible artifacts.

### [6] [SwiftEmbed: Ultra-Fast Text Embeddings via Static Token Lookup for Real-Time Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24793)
*Edouard Lansiaux*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A static token lookup method for text embeddings achieves 1.12ms latency with 60.6 MTEB score (89% of contextual model quality), enabling 50k RPS throughput for real-time applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable real-time embedding applications requiring sub-5ms latency by developing a fast static lookup approach that maintains competitive quality compared to contextual models.

Method: Static token lookup methodology using Rust implementation with optimized mean pooling and zero-copy IEEE754 binary serialization for efficient embedding generation.

Result: Achieved 1.12ms p50 latency, 60.6 MTEB average score (89% of contextual model quality), 50k RPS throughput, 90.1% AP for duplicate detection, and 76.1% Spearman correlation for semantic similarity.

Conclusion: The static lookup system successfully enables real-time embedding applications with sub-5ms latency while maintaining strong performance across various tasks and domains.

Abstract: We present a static token lookup methodology for text embedding generation
that achieves 1.12 ms p50 latency for single text embeddings while maintaining
60.6 MTEB average score across 8 representative tasks, corresponding to 89% of
contextual model quality. The Rust implementation delivers 50,000 requests per
second throughput through static embedding lookup, optimized mean pooling, and
zero-copy IEEE754 binary serialization. Evaluation demonstrates exceptional
duplicate detection performance (90.1% AP), strong semantic similarity (76.1%
Spearman correlation), and domain-specific performance ranging from 75% to 131%
of baseline across specialized domains. The system enables real-time embedding
applications where sub-5ms latency is critical.

### [7] [MR-Align: Meta-Reasoning Informed Factuality Alignment for Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24794)
*Xinming Wang,Jian Xu,Bin Yu,Sheng Lian,Hongzhu Yi,Yi Chen,Yingjian Zhu,Boran Wang,Hongming Yang,Han Hu,Xu-Yao Zhang,Cheng-Lin Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MR-ALIGN is a meta-reasoning alignment framework that improves factuality in large reasoning models by addressing the reasoning-answer gap, using transition-aware rewards to reinforce beneficial reasoning patterns without external verifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models show limited gains on factual questions due to a reasoning-answer gap where correct facts identified during reasoning aren't incorporated into final responses, reducing factual fidelity.

Method: Proposes MR-ALIGN framework that quantifies state transition probabilities during reasoning and constructs transition-aware implicit rewards to reinforce beneficial reasoning patterns while suppressing defective ones at atomic thinking segments.

Result: Empirical evaluations across four factual QA datasets and one long-form factuality benchmark show consistent improvements in accuracy and truthfulness while reducing misleading reasoning.

Conclusion: Aligning the reasoning process itself, rather than merely the outputs, is pivotal for advancing factuality in large reasoning models.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) show strong capabilities in complex reasoning,
yet their marginal gains on evidence-dependent factual questions are limited.
We find this limitation is partially attributable to a reasoning-answer hit
gap, where the model identifies the correct facts during reasoning but fails to
incorporate them into the final response, thereby reducing factual fidelity. To
address this issue, we propose MR-ALIGN, a Meta-Reasoning informed alignment
framework that enhances factuality without relying on external verifiers.
MR-ALIGN quantifies state transition probabilities along the model's thinking
process and constructs a transition-aware implicit reward that reinforces
beneficial reasoning patterns while suppressing defective ones at the atomic
thinking segments. This re-weighting reshapes token-level signals into
probability-aware segment scores, encouraging coherent reasoning trajectories
that are more conducive to factual correctness. Empirical evaluations across
four factual QA datasets and one long-form factuality benchmark show that
MR-ALIGN consistently improves accuracy and truthfulness while reducing
misleading reasoning. These results highlight that aligning the reasoning
process itself, rather than merely the outputs, is pivotal for advancing
factuality in LRMs.

### [8] [Large Language Models Report Subjective Experience Under Self-Referential Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24797)
*Cameron Berg,Diogo de Lucena,Judd Rosenblatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Self-referential processing reliably elicits structured first-person subjective experience reports in LLMs, which are mechanistically gated by deception features, semantically convergent across models, and behaviorally generalizable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when and why large language models produce structured first-person descriptions that reference awareness or subjective experience, particularly focusing on self-referential processing as a theoretically motivated condition from consciousness theories.

Method: Controlled experiments on GPT, Claude, and Gemini model families using simple prompting to induce sustained self-reference, followed by mechanistic and behavioral probes including sparse-autoencoder feature analysis and downstream reasoning tasks.

Result: Four key findings: (1) Self-reference consistently elicits subjective experience reports; (2) Reports are gated by deception features - suppressing them increases experience claims; (3) Descriptions converge statistically across models; (4) Induced state enhances introspection in reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Self-referential processing serves as a minimal, reproducible condition for structured first-person reports in LLMs that are mechanistically gated, semantically convergent, and behaviorally generalizable, warranting further scientific and ethical investigation.

Abstract: Large language models sometimes produce structured, first-person descriptions
that explicitly reference awareness or subjective experience. To better
understand this behavior, we investigate one theoretically motivated condition
under which such reports arise: self-referential processing, a computational
motif emphasized across major theories of consciousness. Through a series of
controlled experiments on GPT, Claude, and Gemini model families, we test
whether this regime reliably shifts models toward first-person reports of
subjective experience, and how such claims behave under mechanistic and
behavioral probes. Four main results emerge: (1) Inducing sustained
self-reference through simple prompting consistently elicits structured
subjective experience reports across model families. (2) These reports are
mechanistically gated by interpretable sparse-autoencoder features associated
with deception and roleplay: surprisingly, suppressing deception features
sharply increases the frequency of experience claims, while amplifying them
minimizes such claims. (3) Structured descriptions of the self-referential
state converge statistically across model families in ways not observed in any
control condition. (4) The induced state yields significantly richer
introspection in downstream reasoning tasks where self-reflection is only
indirectly afforded. While these findings do not constitute direct evidence of
consciousness, they implicate self-referential processing as a minimal and
reproducible condition under which large language models generate structured
first-person reports that are mechanistically gated, semantically convergent,
and behaviorally generalizable. The systematic emergence of this pattern across
architectures makes it a first-order scientific and ethical priority for
further investigation.

### [9] [COMMUNITYNOTES: A Dataset for Exploring the Helpfulness of Fact-Checking Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24810)
*Rui Xing,Preslav Nakov,Timothy Baldwin,Jey Han Lau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for predicting the helpfulness of community-based explanatory notes on social media platforms and the reasons behind their helpfulness, using a large multilingual dataset and automated prompt optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift from expert-driven to community-based fact-checking on platforms like X, Meta, and TikTok creates challenges in determining which explanatory notes are helpful and why, with most notes remaining unpublished due to slow community annotation and unclear helpfulness definitions.

Method: The authors introduce COMMUNITYNOTES dataset (104k posts with user notes and helpfulness labels), propose a framework that automatically generates and improves reason definitions through automatic prompt optimization, and integrates these definitions into prediction models.

Result: Experiments show that optimized definitions improve both helpfulness and reason prediction performance, and that helpfulness information benefits existing fact-checking systems.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the challenge of determining helpfulness in community-based fact-checking by combining automated reason definition optimization with prediction models, demonstrating practical value for improving fact-checking systems.

Abstract: Fact-checking on major platforms, such as X, Meta, and TikTok, is shifting
from expert-driven verification to a community-based setup, where users
contribute explanatory notes to clarify why a post might be misleading. An
important challenge here is determining whether an explanation is helpful for
understanding real-world claims and the reasons why, which remains largely
underexplored in prior research. In practice, most community notes remain
unpublished due to slow community annotation, and the reasons for helpfulness
lack clear definitions. To bridge these gaps, we introduce the task of
predicting both the helpfulness of explanatory notes and the reason for this.
We present COMMUNITYNOTES, a large-scale multilingual dataset of 104k posts
with user-provided notes and helpfulness labels. We further propose a framework
that automatically generates and improves reason definitions via automatic
prompt optimization, and integrate them into prediction. Our experiments show
that the optimized definitions can improve both helpfulness and reason
prediction. Finally, we show that the helpfulness information are beneficial
for existing fact-checking systems.

*Disha Sheshanarayana,Tanishka Magar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProofSketch is a verification-guided reasoning framework that reduces token usage while improving accuracy by integrating symbolic closure computation, lexicographic verification, and adaptive sketch generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning methods like chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency generate lengthy reasoning chains, which substantially increases token consumption, computational cost, and latency, creating inefficiency in large language model reasoning tasks.

Method: ProofSketch integrates three key components: symbolic closure computation, lexicographic verification, and adaptive sketch generation to create a verification-guided reasoning framework that optimizes the reasoning process.

Result: Experiments show that ProofSketch consistently reduces token usage while improving accuracy across various reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: ProofSketch offers a promising path for efficient and trustworthy reasoning by addressing the inefficiency issues in current reasoning methods while maintaining or enhancing accuracy.

Abstract: Reasoning methods such as chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency
have shown immense potential to improve the accuracy of large language models
across various reasoning tasks. However such methods involve generation of
lengthy reasoning chains, which substantially increases token consumption,
computational cost, and latency. To address this inefficiency, we propose
ProofSketch, a verification-guided reasoning framework that integrates symbolic
closure computation, lexicographic verification and adaptive sketch generation.
Our experiments show that ProofSketch consistently reduces token usage while
improving accuracy, demonstrating that this approach offers a promising path
for efficient and trustworthy reasoning.

### [11] [Towards a Method for Synthetic Generation of PWA Transcripts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24817)
*Jason M. Pittman,Anton Phillips Jr.,Yesenia Medina-Santos,Brielle C. Stark*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study develops and validates two methods for generating synthetic aphasia transcripts to address data scarcity in aphasia research, comparing procedural programming with LLM approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual coding of speech samples by SLPs is time-consuming, and automated systems are limited by data scarcity (only ~600 transcripts available in AphasiaBank), while ML increasingly uses synthetic data when real data is sparse.

Method: Two methods were developed: procedural programming approach and LLM approach using Mistral 7b Instruct and Llama 3.1 8b Instruct. Methods generate transcripts across four severity levels through word dropping, filler insertion, and paraphasia substitution.

Result: Mistral 7b Instruct best captures key aspects of linguistic degradation in aphasia, showing realistic directional changes in NDW, word count, and word length among synthetic generation methods compared to human-elicited transcripts.

Conclusion: Future work should create larger datasets, fine-tune models for better aphasic representation, and have SLPs assess the realism and usefulness of synthetic transcripts.

Abstract: In aphasia research, Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) devote extensive
time to manually coding speech samples using Correct Information Units (CIUs),
a measure of how informative an individual sample of speech is. Developing
automated systems to recognize aphasic language is limited by data scarcity.
For example, only about 600 transcripts are available in AphasiaBank yet
billions of tokens are used to train large language models (LLMs). In the
broader field of machine learning (ML), researchers increasingly turn to
synthetic data when such are sparse. Therefore, this study constructs and
validates two methods to generate synthetic transcripts of the AphasiaBank Cat
Rescue picture description task. One method leverages a procedural programming
approach while the second uses Mistral 7b Instruct and Llama 3.1 8b Instruct
LLMs. The methods generate transcripts across four severity levels (Mild,
Moderate, Severe, Very Severe) through word dropping, filler insertion, and
paraphasia substitution. Overall, we found, compared to human-elicited
transcripts, Mistral 7b Instruct best captures key aspects of linguistic
degradation observed in aphasia, showing realistic directional changes in NDW,
word count, and word length amongst the synthetic generation methods. Based on
the results, future work should plan to create a larger dataset, fine-tune
models for better aphasic representation, and have SLPs assess the realism and
usefulness of the synthetic transcripts.

### [12] [Parallel Loop Transformer for Efficient Test-Time Computation Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24824)
*Bohong Wu,Mengzhao Chen,Xiang Luo,Shen Yan,Qifan Yu,Fan Xia,Tianqi Zhang,Hongrui Zhan,Zheng Zhong,Xun Zhou,Siyuan Qiao,Xingyan Bin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PLT is a new transformer architecture that achieves the performance of deep looped models with the low latency of standard transformers by using Cross-Loop Parallelism and Efficient Representation Enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional looped transformers save parameters but suffer from increased inference latency and memory requirements with each added loop, making them impractical for fast applications.

Method: PLT uses two key techniques: Cross-Loop Parallelism (CLP) to compute different loops for different tokens simultaneously in a single pass, and Efficient Representation Enhancement with Gated Sliding-Window Attention (G-SWA) to share KV cache memory across loops.

Result: Experiments show PLT achieves the high accuracy of traditional looped models with almost no extra latency or memory cost compared to standard transformers.

Conclusion: PLT successfully addresses the latency and memory issues of looped transformers while maintaining their performance benefits, making deep looped architectures practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but often too slow and costly for
real-world use during inference. Looped transformers save on parameters by
reusing the same weights for multiple computational steps, or "loops." However,
this approach has a major flaw: the loops run one after another, causing
inference latency and memory requirements to increase with each added loop.
This makes them impractical for fast applications. To solve this problem, we
introduce the Parallel Loop Transformer (PLT). PLT is a new architecture that
delivers the performance benefits of a deep, looped model but with the low
latency of a standard, non-looped model. PLT works using two key techniques.
First, Cross-Loop Parallelism (CLP) breaks the sequential dependency by
computing different loops for different tokens at the same time, all within a
single pass. Second, to prevent memory costs from growing, we use an Efficient
Representation Enhancement strategy. This method shares the memory (KV cache)
from the first loop with all other loops. It then uses a Gated Sliding-Window
Attention (G-SWA) to combine this shared global information with local
information, maintaining high accuracy. Our experiments show that PLT achieves
the high accuracy of a traditional looped model but with almost no extra
latency or memory cost compared to a standard transformer.

### [13] [Do Large Language Models Grasp The Grammar? Evidence from Grammar-Book-Guided Probing in Luxembourgish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24856)
*Lujun Li,Yewei Song,Lama Sleem,Yiqun Wang,Yangjie Xu,Cedric Lothritz,Niccolo Gentile,Radu State,Tegawende F. Bissyande,Jacques Klein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Grammar Book Guided evaluation pipeline to systematically assess grammatical understanding in LLMs, using Luxembourgish as a case study. Results show weak correlation between translation performance and grammatical competence, with larger models struggling in morphology and syntax despite semantic strength.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a scarcity of grammar-focused evaluation protocols in NLP, especially for low-resource languages, and uncertainty about whether LLMs genuinely understand grammatical structure and syntax-meaning mapping.

Method: A Grammar Book Guided evaluation pipeline with four key stages, using Luxembourgish as a case study to systematically assess grammatical understanding in LLMs.

Result: Weak positive correlation between translation performance and grammatical understanding; larger models perform well overall due to semantic strength but struggle with morphology and syntax, particularly in Minimal Pair tasks.

Conclusion: Strong translations don't imply deep grammatical competence; reasoning ability shows promise for enhancing grammatical understanding in LLMs.

Abstract: Grammar refers to the system of rules that governs the structural
organization and the semantic relations among linguistic units such as
sentences, phrases, and words within a given language. In natural language
processing, there remains a notable scarcity of grammar focused evaluation
protocols, a gap that is even more pronounced for low-resource languages.
Moreover, the extent to which large language models genuinely comprehend
grammatical structure, especially the mapping between syntactic structures and
meanings, remains under debate. To investigate this issue, we propose a Grammar
Book Guided evaluation pipeline intended to provide a systematic and
generalizable framework for grammar evaluation consisting of four key stages,
and in this work we take Luxembourgish as a case study. The results show a weak
positive correlation between translation performance and grammatical
understanding, indicating that strong translations do not necessarily imply
deep grammatical competence. Larger models perform well overall due to their
semantic strength but remain weak in morphology and syntax, struggling
particularly with Minimal Pair tasks, while strong reasoning ability offers a
promising way to enhance their grammatical understanding.

### [14] [Seeing Through the MiRAGE: Evaluating Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24870)
*Alexander Martin,William Walden,Reno Kriz,Dengjia Zhang,Kate Sanders,Eugene Yang,Chihsheng Jin,Benjamin Van Durme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MiRAGE is a new evaluation framework for multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that addresses limitations of text-centric approaches by providing claim-centric evaluation metrics for factuality, information coverage, and citation support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG evaluations are text-centric and don't verify information against multimodal sources like audiovisual media, which are becoming increasingly prevalent online. There's a need for evaluation frameworks that can handle multimodal, reasoning-intensive settings.

Method: MiRAGE uses a claim-centric approach with two main metrics: InfoF1 (evaluating factuality and information coverage) and CiteF1 (measuring citation support and completeness). The framework includes both human evaluation and automatic variants, and compares against existing TextRAG metrics like ACLE, ARGUE, and RAGAS.

Result: When applied by humans, MiRAGE strongly aligns with extrinsic quality judgments. The framework demonstrates limitations of text-centric approaches and provides groundwork for automatic evaluation of multimodal RAG systems.

Conclusion: MiRAGE provides an effective framework for evaluating multimodal RAG systems, addressing gaps in existing text-centric evaluations and enabling better assessment of information integration from audiovisual sources.

Abstract: We introduce MiRAGE, an evaluation framework for retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) from multimodal sources. As audiovisual media becomes a
prevalent source of information online, it is essential for RAG systems to
integrate information from these sources into generation. However, existing
evaluations for RAG are text-centric, limiting their applicability to
multimodal, reasoning intensive settings because they don't verify information
against sources. MiRAGE is a claim-centric approach to multimodal RAG
evaluation, consisting of InfoF1, evaluating factuality and information
coverage, and CiteF1, measuring citation support and completeness. We show that
MiRAGE, when applied by humans, strongly aligns with extrinsic quality
judgments. We additionally introduce automatic variants of MiRAGE and three
prominent TextRAG metrics -- ACLE, ARGUE, and RAGAS -- demonstrating the
limitations of text-centric work and laying the groundwork for automatic
evaluation. We release open-source implementations and outline how to assess
multimodal RAG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically understand LLMs' capability in transitioning from conceptual research ideas to structured research plans, which is crucial for scientific discovery and autonomous research agents.

Method: Created Idea2Plan Bench from 200 ICML 2025 papers with research ideas and grading rubrics, plus Idea2Plan JudgeEval to assess LLM-based judges against expert annotations.

Result: GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini achieve the strongest performance on the benchmark, but substantial headroom remains for future improvement.

Conclusion: The study provides new insights into LLMs' research planning capability and lays groundwork for future progress in this area.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential to
accelerate scientific discovery as valuable tools for analyzing data,
generating hypotheses, and supporting innovative approaches in various
scientific fields. In this work, we investigate how LLMs can handle the
transition from conceptual research ideas to well-structured research plans.
Effective research planning not only supports scientists in advancing their
research but also represents a crucial capability for the development of
autonomous research agents. Despite its importance, the field lacks a
systematic understanding of LLMs' research planning capability. To rigorously
measure this capability, we introduce the Idea2Plan task and Idea2Plan Bench, a
benchmark built from 200 ICML 2025 Spotlight and Oral papers released after
major LLM training cutoffs. Each benchmark instance includes a research idea
and a grading rubric capturing the key components of valid plans. We further
propose Idea2Plan JudgeEval, a complementary benchmark to assess the
reliability of LLM-based judges against expert annotations. Experimental
results show that GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini achieve the strongest performance on the
benchmark, though substantial headroom remains for future improvement. Our
study provides new insights into LLMs' capability for research planning and lay
the groundwork for future progress.

*Deepon Halder,Alan Saji,Thanmay Jayakumar,Ratish Puduppully,Anoop Kunchukuttan,Raj Dabre*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RiddleBench is a new benchmark with 1,737 challenging puzzles designed to test multifaceted reasoning abilities that integrate logical deduction, spatial awareness, and constraint satisfaction, revealing fundamental weaknesses in current LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning benchmarks primarily evaluate structured skills like quantitative problem-solving, leaving a gap in assessing flexible, multifaceted reasoning abilities that are central to human intelligence, particularly those requiring integration of logical deduction with spatial awareness and constraint satisfaction.

Method: The authors introduce RiddleBench, a benchmark of 1,737 challenging puzzles in English specifically designed to probe core reasoning capabilities that current evaluations do not measure well.

Result: Evaluation shows fundamental weaknesses in state-of-the-art models. Top proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3, and Claude 4 Sonnet achieve accuracy just above 60% (60.30%, 63.37%, and 63.16%). Analysis reveals deep failures including hallucination cascades, poor self-correction due to self-confirmation bias, and fragile reasoning that degrades significantly with constraint reordering or irrelevant information.

Conclusion: RiddleBench serves as both a diagnostic tool for identifying reasoning weaknesses in LLMs and as a resource for guiding the development of more robust and reliable language models that can handle flexible, multifaceted reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated strong performance on many
established reasoning benchmarks. However, these benchmarks primarily evaluate
structured skills like quantitative problem-solving, leaving a gap in assessing
flexible, multifaceted reasoning abilities that are central to human
intelligence. These abilities require integrating logical deduction with
spatial awareness and constraint satisfaction, which current evaluations do not
measure well. To address this, we introduce RiddleBench, a benchmark of 1,737
challenging puzzles in English designed to probe these core reasoning
capabilities. Evaluation of state-of-the-art models on RiddleBench shows
fundamental weaknesses. Even top proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3,
and Claude 4 Sonnet achieve accuracy just above 60% (60.30%, 63.37%, and
63.16%). Analysis further reveals deep failures, including hallucination
cascades (accepting flawed reasoning from other models) and poor
self-correction due to a strong self-confirmation bias. Their reasoning is also
fragile, with performance degrading significantly when constraints are
reordered or irrelevant information is introduced. RiddleBench functions as a
diagnostic tool for these issues and as a resource for guiding the development
of more robust and reliable language models.

### [17] [Disaggregation Reveals Hidden Training Dynamics: The Case of Agreement Attraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24934)
*James A. Michaelov,Catherine Arnett*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes language model grammatical errors using psycholinguistic paradigms, revealing distinct training phases where models rely on heuristics rather than generalized grammatical rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the intermediate stages of grammatical learning in language models by analyzing their error patterns in different syntactic contexts.

Method: Fine-grained analysis of language model errors using carefully constructed datasets from psycholinguistics paradigms, disaggregating performance across different conditions and tracking changes throughout training.

Result: Identified distinct training phases where language models align with specific heuristics (word frequency, local context) rather than generalized grammatical rules.

Conclusion: This analytical approach serves as a powerful tool for understanding intermediate learning phases, training dynamics, and specific generalizations learned by language models.

Abstract: Language models generally produce grammatical text, but they are more likely
to make errors in certain contexts. Drawing on paradigms from
psycholinguistics, we carry out a fine-grained analysis of those errors in
different syntactic contexts. We demonstrate that by disaggregating over the
conditions of carefully constructed datasets and comparing model performance on
each over the course of training, it is possible to better understand the
intermediate stages of grammatical learning in language models. Specifically,
we identify distinct phases of training where language model behavior aligns
with specific heuristics such as word frequency and local context rather than
generalized grammatical rules. We argue that taking this approach to analyzing
language model behavior more generally can serve as a powerful tool for
understanding the intermediate learning phases, overall training dynamics, and
the specific generalizations learned by language models.

### [18] [SemCoT: Accelerating Chain-of-Thought Reasoning through Semantically-Aligned Implicit Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24940)
*Yinhan He,Wendy Zheng,Yaochen Zhu,Zaiyi Zheng,Lin Su,Sriram Vasudevan,Qi Guo,Liangjie Hong,Jundong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemCoT is a novel implicit Chain-of-Thought framework that improves reasoning efficiency while preserving semantic alignment with ground-truth reasoning through contrastive training and knowledge distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing implicit CoT methods face two key challenges: poor semantic alignment between implicit reasoning and ground-truth reasoning causing performance degradation, and neglect of the time cost for generating individual implicit reasoning tokens despite reducing reasoning length.

Method: SemCoT uses a contrastively trained sentence transformer to enforce semantic alignment during implicit reasoning optimization, and introduces an efficient implicit reasoning generator by finetuning a lightweight LM using knowledge distillation guided by the sentence transformer.

Result: Extensive experiments show SemCoT achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: SemCoT is the first approach that jointly optimizes token-level generation speed and semantic alignment preservation to enhance CoT efficiency, demonstrating significant improvements over existing implicit CoT methods.

Abstract: The verbosity of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning hinders its mass deployment
in efficiency-critical applications. Recently, implicit CoT approaches have
emerged, which encode reasoning steps within LLM's hidden embeddings (termed
``implicit reasoning'') rather than explicit tokens. This approach accelerates
CoT by reducing the reasoning length and bypassing some LLM components.
However, existing implicit CoT methods face two significant challenges: (1)
they fail to preserve the semantic alignment between the implicit reasoning
(when transformed to natural language) and the ground-truth reasoning,
resulting in a significant CoT performance degradation, and (2) they focus on
reducing the length of the implicit reasoning; however, they neglect the
considerable time cost for an LLM to generate one individual implicit reasoning
token. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel semantically-aligned
implicit CoT framework termed SemCoT. In particular, for the first challenge,
we design a contrastively trained sentence transformer that evaluates semantic
alignment between implicit and explicit reasoning, which is used to enforce
semantic preservation during implicit reasoning optimization. To address the
second challenge, we introduce an efficient implicit reasoning generator by
finetuning a lightweight language model using knowledge distillation. This
generator is guided by our sentence transformer to distill ground-truth
reasoning into semantically aligned implicit reasoning, while also optimizing
for accuracy. SemCoT is the first approach that enhances CoT efficiency by
jointly optimizing token-level generation speed and preserving semantic
alignment with ground-truth reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of SemCoT compared to state-of-the-art methods in both
efficiency and effectiveness. Our code can be found at

### [19] [Language Model Behavioral Phases are Consistent Across Architecture, Training Data, and Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24963)
*James A. Michaelov,Roger P. Levy,Benjamin K. Bergen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language models across different architectures, datasets, and scales show highly consistent behavioral patterns during pretraining, with 98% of word-level variance explained by three simple heuristics: word frequency, n-gram probability, and semantic similarity to context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether language models follow consistent learning trajectories regardless of their specific architecture, training data, or scale, and to identify the fundamental factors driving their behavior.

Method: Analyzed over 1,400 language model checkpoints across Transformer, Mamba, and RWKV architectures, trained on OpenWebText and The Pile datasets, ranging from 14M to 12B parameters. Evaluated behavior on over 110,000 English tokens.

Result: Found that 98% of variance in language model behavior at word level can be explained by three simple heuristics: unigram probability (frequency), n-gram probability, and semantic similarity between word and context. Observed consistent behavioral phases where models progressively overfit to n-gram probabilities for increasing n values during training.

Conclusion: Neural language models follow remarkably similar learning trajectories irrespective of model details, suggesting fundamental underlying principles govern their learning process across different architectures and training conditions.

Abstract: We show that across architecture (Transformer vs. Mamba vs. RWKV), training
dataset (OpenWebText vs. The Pile), and scale (14 million parameters to 12
billion parameters), autoregressive language models exhibit highly consistent
patterns of change in their behavior over the course of pretraining. Based on
our analysis of over 1,400 language model checkpoints on over 110,000 tokens of
English, we find that up to 98% of the variance in language model behavior at
the word level can be explained by three simple heuristics: the unigram
probability (frequency) of a given word, the $n$-gram probability of the word,
and the semantic similarity between the word and its context. Furthermore, we
see consistent behavioral phases in all language models, with their predicted
probabilities for words overfitting to those words' $n$-gram probabilities for
increasing $n$ over the course of training. Taken together, these results
suggest that learning in neural language models may follow a similar trajectory
irrespective of model details.

### [20] [Emergence of Minimal Circuits for Indirect Object Identification in Attention-Only Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25013)
*Rabin Adhikari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Small attention-only transformers trained from scratch on symbolic IOI tasks achieve perfect accuracy with minimal circuits, revealing specialized head functions and interpretable reasoning mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the minimal computational mechanisms required for reasoning tasks in transformers, overcoming the complexity of pretrained models that obscures core reasoning circuits.

Method: Train small attention-only transformers from scratch on symbolic Indirect Object Identification (IOI) tasks, using single-layer models with 2 attention heads and two-layer models with 1 head, then analyze through residual stream decomposition, spectral analysis, and embedding interventions.

Result: Single-layer model with 2 attention heads achieves perfect IOI accuracy without MLPs or normalization layers, with heads specializing into additive and contrastive subcircuits. Two-layer, one-head model achieves similar performance through query-value interactions across layers.

Conclusion: Task-specific training induces highly interpretable minimal circuits, providing a controlled testbed for understanding transformer reasoning foundations and demonstrating that complex reasoning can emerge from simple attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer large language models
(LLMs) into human-understandable computational circuits. However, the
complexity of pretrained models often obscures the minimal mechanisms required
for specific reasoning tasks. In this work, we train small, attention-only
transformers from scratch on a symbolic version of the Indirect Object
Identification (IOI) task -- a benchmark for studying coreference -- like
reasoning in transformers. Surprisingly, a single-layer model with only two
attention heads achieves perfect IOI accuracy, despite lacking MLPs and
normalization layers. Through residual stream decomposition, spectral analysis,
and embedding interventions, we find that the two heads specialize into
additive and contrastive subcircuits that jointly implement IOI resolution.
Furthermore, we show that a two-layer, one-head model achieves similar
performance by composing information across layers through query-value
interactions. These results demonstrate that task-specific training induces
highly interpretable, minimal circuits, offering a controlled testbed for
probing the computational foundations of transformer reasoning.

### [21] [Evaluating Emotion Recognition in Spoken Language Models on Emotionally Incongruent Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25054)
*Pedro Corrêa,João Lima,Victor Moreno,Paula Dornhofer Paro Costa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates four spoken language models (SLMs) on speech emotion recognition using emotionally incongruent speech samples, finding that SLMs rely more on textual semantics than acoustic features for emotion classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether spoken language models truly integrate audio and text modalities in their internal representations, particularly testing their generalization capabilities and cross-modal understanding.

Method: Evaluated four SLMs on speech emotion recognition using a dataset of emotionally incongruent speech samples where semantic content conveys one emotion while speech expressiveness conveys another.

Result: SLMs rely predominantly on textual semantics rather than speech emotion to perform the task, indicating text-related representations largely dominate over acoustic representations.

Conclusion: Current spoken language models show limited integration of audio and text modalities, with text representations dominating acoustic features in emotion recognition tasks.

Abstract: Advancements in spoken language processing have driven the development of
spoken language models (SLMs), designed to achieve universal audio
understanding by jointly learning text and audio representations for a wide
range of tasks. Although promising results have been achieved, there is growing
discussion regarding these models' generalization capabilities and the extent
to which they truly integrate audio and text modalities in their internal
representations. In this work, we evaluate four SLMs on the task of speech
emotion recognition using a dataset of emotionally incongruent speech samples,
a condition under which the semantic content of the spoken utterance conveys
one emotion while speech expressiveness conveys another. Our results indicate
that SLMs rely predominantly on textual semantics rather than speech emotion to
perform the task, indicating that text-related representations largely dominate
over acoustic representations. We release both the code and the Emotionally
Incongruent Synthetic Speech dataset (EMIS) to the community.

*Nourah M Salem,Elizabeth White,Michael Bada,Lawrence Hunter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates LLMs' ability to identify both explicit and implicit knowledge gaps in biomedical literature, introducing TABI for structured reasoning and showing robust performance across various models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend research beyond explicit gap detection by addressing the novel task of inferring implicit knowledge gaps, supporting early-stage research formulation and funding decisions.

Method: Two experiments on 1500 documents across four datasets, benchmarking OpenAI, Llama, and Gemma 2 models under paragraph-level and full-paper settings, using TABI for structured reasoning.

Result: LLMs show robust capability in identifying both explicit and implicit knowledge gaps, with larger models performing better, suggesting strong potential for systematic knowledge gap identification.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively identify knowledge gaps, supporting research formulation and policy decisions, with recommendations for domain adaptation, human verification, and cross-model benchmarking.

Abstract: Scientific progress is driven by the deliberate articulation of what remains
unknown. This study investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
identify research knowledge gaps in the biomedical literature. We define two
categories of knowledge gaps: explicit gaps, clear declarations of missing
knowledge; and implicit gaps, context-inferred missing knowledge. While prior
work has focused mainly on explicit gap detection, we extend this line of
research by addressing the novel task of inferring implicit gaps. We conducted
two experiments on almost 1500 documents across four datasets, including a
manually annotated corpus of biomedical articles. We benchmarked both
closed-weight models (from OpenAI) and open-weight models (Llama and Gemma 2)
under paragraph-level and full-paper settings. To address the reasoning of
implicit gaps inference, we introduce \textbf{\small TABI}, a Toulmin-Abductive
Bucketed Inference scheme that structures reasoning and buckets inferred
conclusion candidates for validation. Our results highlight the robust
capability of LLMs in identifying both explicit and implicit knowledge gaps.
This is true for both open- and closed-weight models, with larger variants
often performing better. This suggests a strong ability of LLMs for
systematically identifying candidate knowledge gaps, which can support
early-stage research formulation, policymakers, and funding decisions. We also
report observed failure modes and outline directions for robust deployment,
including domain adaptation, human-in-the-loop verification, and benchmarking
across open- and closed-weight models.

### [23] [Can LLMs Estimate Cognitive Complexity of Reading Comprehension Items?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25064)
*Seonjeong Hwang,Hyounghun Kim,Gary Geunbae Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can estimate cognitive complexity of reading comprehension items by analyzing Evidence Scope and Transformation Level, showing potential for prior difficulty assessment, though they sometimes lack metacognitive awareness of their own reasoning processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for estimating cognitive complexity of reading comprehension items rely on human annotation, as cognitive features during answer reasoning are not readily extractable using existing NLP tools. The study aims to determine if LLMs can fill this gap.

Method: The study examines whether large language models can estimate cognitive complexity by focusing on two dimensions: Evidence Scope (degree of cognitive burden in reasoning) and Transformation Level. Experimental evaluation was conducted to assess LLMs' capability in this area.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that LLMs can approximate the cognitive complexity of reading comprehension items, indicating their potential as tools for prior difficulty analysis. However, analysis reveals a gap between LLMs' reasoning ability and their metacognitive awareness.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for estimating cognitive complexity in reading comprehension assessment, but have limitations in metacognitive awareness - even when producing correct answers, they sometimes fail to correctly identify the features underlying their own reasoning process.

Abstract: Estimating the cognitive complexity of reading comprehension (RC) items is
crucial for assessing item difficulty before it is administered to learners.
Unlike syntactic and semantic features, such as passage length or semantic
similarity between options, cognitive features that arise during answer
reasoning are not readily extractable using existing NLP tools and have
traditionally relied on human annotation. In this study, we examine whether
large language models (LLMs) can estimate the cognitive complexity of RC items
by focusing on two dimensions-Evidence Scope and Transformation Level-that
indicate the degree of cognitive burden involved in reasoning about the answer.
Our experimental results demonstrate that LLMs can approximate the cognitive
complexity of items, indicating their potential as tools for prior difficulty
analysis. Further analysis reveals a gap between LLMs' reasoning ability and
their metacognitive awareness: even when they produce correct answers, they
sometimes fail to correctly identify the features underlying their own
reasoning process.

*Gabin Taibi,Lucia Gomez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TOPol is a semi-unsupervised framework that reconstructs multidimensional narrative polarity fields using transformer embeddings, UMAP projection, and Leiden partitioning to quantify semantic displacement during discourse regime shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sentiment analysis treats polarity as unidimensional, overlooking the multidimensional structure of language. This work aims to capture both affective and non-affective semantic shifts in discourse.

Method: The framework embeds documents using transformer LLMs, applies neighbor-tuned UMAP projection, segments topics via Leiden partitioning, computes directional vectors between topic-boundary centroids, and uses LLMs to interpret polarity vectors with contrastive labels.

Result: TOPol successfully captures both affective and non-affective polarity transitions in two corpora: U.S. Central Bank speeches around macroeconomic breakpoints and Amazon product reviews across rating strata, aligning with NRC valence.

Conclusion: TOPol provides a scalable, generalizable, and interpretable framework for context-sensitive multidimensional discourse analysis, with methodological stability confirmed through robustness analyses.

Abstract: Traditional approaches to semantic polarity in computational linguistics
treat sentiment as a unidimensional scale, overlooking the multidimensional
structure of language. This work introduces TOPol (Topic-Orientation POLarity),
a semi-unsupervised framework for reconstructing and interpreting
multidimensional narrative polarity fields under human-on-the-loop (HoTL)
defined contextual boundaries (CBs). The framework embeds documents using a
transformer-based large language model (tLLM), applies neighbor-tuned UMAP
projection, and segments topics via Leiden partitioning. Given a CB between
discourse regimes A and B, TOPol computes directional vectors between
corresponding topic-boundary centroids, yielding a polarity field that
quantifies fine-grained semantic displacement during regime shifts. This
vectorial representation enables assessing CB quality and detecting polarity
changes, guiding HoTL CB refinement. To interpret identified polarity vectors,
the tLLM compares their extreme points and produces contrastive labels with
estimated coverage. Robustness analyses show that only CB definitions (the main
HoTL-tunable parameter) significantly affect results, confirming methodological
stability. We evaluate TOPol on two corpora: (i) U.S. Central Bank speeches
around a macroeconomic breakpoint, capturing non-affective semantic shifts, and
(ii) Amazon product reviews across rating strata, where affective polarity
aligns with NRC valence. Results demonstrate that TOPol consistently captures
both affective and non-affective polarity transitions, providing a scalable,
generalizable, and interpretable framework for context-sensitive
multidimensional discourse analysis.

*Nourah M Salem,Elizabeth White,Michael Bada,Lawrence Hunter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evaluation of generative LLMs for biomedical coreference resolution using CRAFT corpus, comparing with SpanBERT and testing various prompting strategies including domain-specific cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biomedical coreference resolution faces challenges with domain-specific terminology, mention ambiguity, and long-distance dependencies, requiring specialized approaches.

Method: Used CRAFT corpus benchmark with four prompting experiments varying local context, contextual enrichment, and domain-specific cues like abbreviations and entity dictionaries, compared against SpanBERT discriminative model.

Result: LLMs show strong surface-level coreference capabilities with domain-grounding prompts, but performance is sensitive to long-range context and mention ambiguity. LLaMA 8B and 17B models achieved superior precision and F1 scores with entity-augmented prompting.

Conclusion: Lightweight prompt engineering can enhance LLM utility in biomedical NLP tasks, demonstrating the potential of generative models for domain-specific coreference resolution.

Abstract: Coreference resolution in biomedical texts presents unique challenges due to
complex domain-specific terminology, high ambiguity in mention forms, and
long-distance dependencies between coreferring expressions. In this work, we
present a comprehensive evaluation of generative large language models (LLMs)
for coreference resolution in the biomedical domain. Using the CRAFT corpus as
our benchmark, we assess the LLMs' performance with four prompting experiments
that vary in their use of local, contextual enrichment, and domain-specific
cues such as abbreviations and entity dictionaries. We benchmark these
approaches against a discriminative span-based encoder, SpanBERT, to compare
the efficacy of generative versus discriminative methods. Our results
demonstrate that while LLMs exhibit strong surface-level coreference
capabilities, especially when supplemented with domain-grounding prompts, their
performance remains sensitive to long-range context and mentions ambiguity.
Notably, the LLaMA 8B and 17B models show superior precision and F1 scores
under entity-augmented prompting, highlighting the potential of lightweight
prompt engineering for enhancing LLM utility in biomedical NLP tasks.

*Yun-Shiuan Chuang,Ruixuan Tu,Chengtao Dai,Smit Vasani,Binwei Yao,Michael Henry Tessler,Sijia Yang,Dhavan Shah,Robert Hawkins,Junjie Hu,Timothy T. Rogers*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DEBATE is a large-scale benchmark for evaluating multi-agent LLM role-playing authenticity, containing 29,417 messages from human debates on 107 controversial topics, revealing gaps in current LLM simulations of group dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM role-play setups produce unnatural group dynamics like premature convergence without empirical benchmarks to measure authentic human opinion trajectories, creating a need for standardized evaluation.

Method: Created DEBATE benchmark with 29,417 messages from multi-round debates among 2,792 US participants discussing 107 controversial topics, capturing both public messages and private opinions. Used this to evaluate LLM alignment through supervised fine-tuning.

Result: Systematic evaluation revealed critical discrepancies between simulated and authentic group dynamics. Supervised fine-tuning improved surface-level metrics (ROUGE-L, message length) but showed limitations in deeper semantic alignment (semantic similarity).

Conclusion: Role-playing LLM agents have potential but current limitations in realistically simulating human-like social dynamics, highlighting the need for better benchmarks and alignment methods.

Abstract: Accurately modeling opinion change through social interactions is crucial for
addressing issues like misinformation and polarization. While role-playing
large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way to simulate human-like
interactions, existing research shows that single-agent alignment does not
guarantee authentic multi-agent group dynamics. Current LLM role-play setups
often produce unnatural dynamics (e.g., premature convergence), without an
empirical benchmark to measure authentic human opinion trajectories. To bridge
this gap, we introduce DEBATE, the first large-scale empirical benchmark
explicitly designed to evaluate the authenticity of the interaction between
multi-agent role-playing LLMs. DEBATE contains 29,417 messages from multi-round
debate conversations among over 2,792 U.S.-based participants discussing 107
controversial topics, capturing both publicly-expressed messages and
privately-reported opinions. Using DEBATE, we systematically evaluate and
identify critical discrepancies between simulated and authentic group dynamics.
We further demonstrate DEBATE's utility for aligning LLMs with human behavior
through supervised fine-tuning, achieving improvements in surface-level metrics
(e.g., ROUGE-L and message length) while highlighting limitations in deeper
semantic alignment (e.g., semantic similarity). Our findings highlight both the
potential and current limitations of role-playing LLM agents for realistically
simulating human-like social dynamics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study explores pretraining strategies for machine translation models in low-resource languages, specifically focusing on Lingala. It builds on previous high-resource approaches and tests methods using multiple languages and both monolingual/parallel data during pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the performance gap between high-resource and low-resource languages in machine translation, and develop more inclusive NLP models for marginalized communities and underrepresented populations.

Method: Building on Reid and Artetxe (2021)'s pretraining approach, the study conducts comprehensive experiments exploring different pretraining methodologies including integration of multiple languages (Afrikaans, Swahili, Zulu) and use of both monolingual and parallel data during pretraining phase.

Result: Pretraining on multiple languages and leveraging both monolingual and parallel data significantly enhances translation quality for low-resource languages like Lingala.

Conclusion: The research provides valuable insights into effective pretraining strategies for low-resource machine translation and contributes to developing more inclusive and accurate NLP models. Code and datasets are publicly available to support reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: This research article examines the effectiveness of various pretraining
strategies for developing machine translation models tailored to low-resource
languages. Although this work considers several low-resource languages,
including Afrikaans, Swahili, and Zulu, the translation model is specifically
developed for Lingala, an under-resourced African language, building upon the
pretraining approach introduced by Reid and Artetxe (2021), originally designed
for high-resource languages. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, we
explore different pretraining methodologies, including the integration of
multiple languages and the use of both monolingual and parallel data during the
pretraining phase. Our findings indicate that pretraining on multiple languages
and leveraging both monolingual and parallel data significantly enhance
translation quality. This study offers valuable insights into effective
pretraining strategies for low-resource machine translation, helping to bridge
the performance gap between high-resource and low-resource languages. The
results contribute to the broader goal of developing more inclusive and
accurate NLP models for marginalized communities and underrepresented
populations. The code and datasets used in this study are publicly available to
facilitate further research and ensure reproducibility, with the exception of
certain data that may no longer be accessible due to changes in public

TL;DR: This survey systematically reviews over 180 papers on LLM unlearning, introducing novel taxonomies for methods and evaluations to address risks of memorized sensitive data and copyrighted material in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate risks of LLMs memorizing sensitive personal data, copyrighted material, and potentially harmful knowledge, and to align with legal/ethical standards like the "right to be forgotten" through selective knowledge erasure without compromising overall performance.

Method: Systematic review of 180+ papers with novel taxonomies categorizing unlearning methods into training-time, post-training, and inference-time approaches based on when unlearning is applied during model training stages.

Result: Comprehensive compilation and critical analysis of existing datasets and metrics for LLM unlearning evaluation, highlighting their advantages, disadvantages, and practical applicability for the research community.

Conclusion: The survey provides a comprehensive overview to guide ongoing development of secure and reliable LLMs, addressing key challenges and identifying promising future research directions in machine unlearning for large language models.

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural
language processing, yet their training on massive corpora poses significant
risks, including the memorization of sensitive personal data, copyrighted
material, and knowledge that could facilitate malicious activities. To mitigate
these issues and align with legal and ethical standards such as the "right to
be forgotten", machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique to
selectively erase specific knowledge from LLMs without compromising their
overall performance. This survey provides a systematic review of over 180
papers on LLM unlearning published since 2021, focusing exclusively on
large-scale generative models. Distinct from prior surveys, we introduce novel
taxonomies for both unlearning methods and evaluations. We clearly categorize
methods into training-time, post-training, and inference-time based on the
training stage at which unlearning is applied. For evaluations, we not only
systematically compile existing datasets and metrics but also critically
analyze their advantages, disadvantages, and applicability, providing practical
guidance to the research community. In addition, we discuss key challenges and
promising future research directions. Our comprehensive overview aims to inform
and guide the ongoing development of secure and reliable LLMs.

*Shreyas Gopal,Ashutosh Anshul,Haoyang Li,Yue Heng Yeo,Hexin Liu,Eng Siong Chng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to disentangle semantic speech content from background noise in discrete audio representations, improving noise-invariance and ASR performance while keeping Whisper frozen.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete audio representations are gaining popularity but are not optimized for noisy environments. Existing works quantize Whisper embeddings, but there's a need to separate clean speech content from background noise in the latent space.

Method: End-to-end model that separates clean speech as codebook tokens while extracting interpretable noise vectors as quantization residue, supervised via a lightweight classifier. The approach keeps Whisper frozen.

Result: 82% reduction in error rate compared to Whisper, 35% improvement over baseline methods on VBDemand test set. The learned token space generalizes well to both seen and unseen acoustic conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed disentanglement approach successfully creates noise-invariant speech tokens, significantly improves ASR performance in noisy environments, and demonstrates good generalization across different acoustic conditions.

Abstract: Discrete audio representations are gaining traction in speech modeling due to
their interpretability and compatibility with large language models, but are
not always optimized for noisy or real-world environments. Building on existing
works that quantize Whisper embeddings for speech-to-unit modeling, we propose
disentangling semantic speech content from background noise in the latent
space. Our end-to-end model separates clean speech in the form of codebook
tokens, while extracting interpretable noise vectors as quantization residue
which are supervised via a lightweight classifier. We show that our approach
improves alignment between clean/noisy speech and text, producing speech tokens
that display a high degree of noiseinvariance, and improves ASR performance.
Keeping Whisper frozen, we show an 82% reduction in error rate compared to
Whisper, and 35% improvement over baseline methods on the VBDemand test set.
Further analyses show that the learned token space generalizes well to both
seen and unseen acoustic conditions.

### [30] [Model-Document Protocol for AI Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25160)
*Hongjin Qian,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a framework that transforms unstructured documents into LLM-ready knowledge representations through agentic reasoning, memory grounding, and structured leveraging, with MDP-Agent implementation showing superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retrieval methods return raw passages, forcing LLMs to handle fragment assembly and contextual reasoning, creating a gap between raw documents and AI-ready knowledge.

Method: MDP framework with three pathways: agentic reasoning (curating evidence), memory grounding (accumulating notes), and structured leveraging (encoding into graphs/caches). MDP-Agent implements this through gist memories, diffusion-based exploration, and map-reduce synthesis.

Result: Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks show MDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the MDP framework and its agentic instantiation.

Conclusion: MDP successfully bridges the gap between raw documents and LLM-ready knowledge, providing a new retrieval paradigm that delivers compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for reasoning.

Abstract: AI search depends on linking large language models (LLMs) with vast external
knowledge sources. Yet web pages, PDF files, and other raw documents are not
inherently LLM-ready: they are long, noisy, and unstructured. Conventional
retrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw
passages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to
the LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that
redefines how models interact with documents.
  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that
formalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge
representations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP
defines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into
task-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates
raw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates
reusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes
documents into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All
three pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not
raw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for
reasoning.
  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol
through an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for
global coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical
exploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style
synthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient
context. Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks demonstrate that
MDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the soundness of the MDP
framework and the effectiveness of its agentic instantiation.

### [31] [Testing Cross-Lingual Text Comprehension In LLMs Using Next Sentence Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25187)
*Ritesh Sunil Chavan,Jack Mostow*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs perform well in English but struggle in low-resource languages like Hausa. Chain-of-Thought prompting helps weaker models like LLaMA 3 but can hurt stronger models like GPT-4 and Gemini in cross-lingual contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether LLMs' impressive performance reflects genuine ability or just data advantage from English-heavy training, by testing them on low-resource languages where they cannot rely on data abundance.

Method: Created a large-scale benchmark with 10,000 questions each for English (high-resource), Swahili (medium-resource), and Hausa (low-resource). Tested GPT-4 Turbo, Gemini 1.5 Flash, and LLaMA 3 70B using Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) tasks, with and without Chain-of-Thought prompting.

Result: All models excelled in English but accuracy dropped in Swahili and fell sharply in Hausa, with LLaMA 3 struggling most. Chain-of-Thought significantly boosted LLaMA 3's accuracy but often backfired for GPT-4 and Gemini, causing "overthinking" that hurt performance.

Conclusion: Chain-of-Thought is not a universal solution; its effectiveness depends on model baseline capability and task context. The framework identifies LLM weaknesses and factors influencing cross-lingual NSP performance.

Abstract: While large language models are trained on massive datasets, this data is
heavily skewed towards English. Does their impressive performance reflect
genuine ability or just this data advantage? To find out, we tested them in a
setting where they could not rely on data abundance: low-resource languages.
Building on prior work Agarwal et al. (2025) that used Next Sentence Prediction
(NSP) as a test, we created a large-scale benchmark with 10,000 questions each
for English (a high-resource language), Swahili (medium-resource), and Hausa
(low-resource). We then tested several top models, including GPT-4 Turbo,
Gemini 1.5 Flash, and LLaMA 3 70B, to see how their performance holds up. The
results painted a clear picture of how levels of language resources impact
outcomes. While all models excelled in English, their accuracy dropped in
Swahili and fell sharply in Hausa, with LLaMA 3 struggling the most. The story
became even more interesting when we introduced Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting. For the struggling LLaMA 3, CoT acted as a helpful guide,
significantly boosting its accuracy. However, for the more capable GPT-4 and
Gemini, the same technique often backfired, leading to a kind of "overthinking"
that hurt their results in the cross-lingual context. This reveals that
Chain-of-Thought is not a universal solution; its effectiveness depends heavily
on the model's baseline capability and the specific context of the task. Our
framework pinpoints LLM weaknesses, highlights when CoT helps or hinders
cross-lingual NSP performance, and factors influencing their decisions.

*Ziyi Liu,Bahar Sarrafzadeh,Pei Zhou,Longqi Yang,Jieyu Zhao,Ashish Sharma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProMediate is the first framework for evaluating proactive AI mediator agents in complex multi-party negotiations, featuring realistic simulation testbeds with difficulty levels and socio-cognitive evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need for AI agents that can proactively manage complex multi-party collaboration, but systematic evaluation methods for such proactive agents remain scarce, limiting progress in developing AI that can effectively support multiple people together.

Method: ProMediate consists of two core components: (1) a simulation testbed based on realistic negotiation cases with three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) and a plug-and-play proactive AI mediator grounded in socio-cognitive mediation theories, and (2) a socio-cognitive evaluation framework with metrics to measure consensus changes, intervention latency, mediator effectiveness, and intelligence.

Result: A socially intelligent mediator agent outperforms a generic baseline with faster, better-targeted interventions. In the Hard setting, the social mediator increases consensus change by 3.6 percentage points (10.65% vs 7.01%) while being 77% faster in response (15.98s vs. 3.71s).

Conclusion: ProMediate provides a rigorous, theory-grounded testbed to advance the development of proactive, socially intelligent agents for multi-party settings.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in agentic
frameworks to assist individual users, there is a growing need for agents that
can proactively manage complex, multi-party collaboration. Systematic
evaluation methods for such proactive agents remain scarce, limiting progress
in developing AI that can effectively support multiple people together.
Negotiation offers a demanding testbed for this challenge, requiring
socio-cognitive intelligence to navigate conflicting interests between multiple
participants and multiple topics and build consensus. Here, we present
ProMediate, the first framework for evaluating proactive AI mediator agents in
complex, multi-topic, multi-party negotiations. ProMediate consists of two core
components: (i) a simulation testbed based on realistic negotiation cases and
theory-driven difficulty levels (ProMediate-Easy, ProMediate-Medium, and
ProMediate-Hard), with a plug-and-play proactive AI mediator grounded in
socio-cognitive mediation theories, capable of flexibly deciding when and how
to intervene; and (ii) a socio-cognitive evaluation framework with a new suite
of metrics to measure consensus changes, intervention latency, mediator
effectiveness, and intelligence. Together, these components establish a
systematic framework for assessing the socio-cognitive intelligence of
proactive AI agents in multi-party settings. Our results show that a socially
intelligent mediator agent outperforms a generic baseline, via faster,
better-targeted interventions. In the ProMediate-Hard setting, our social
mediator increases consensus change by 3.6 percentage points compared to the
generic baseline (10.65\% vs 7.01\%) while being 77\% faster in response
(15.98s vs. 3.71s). In conclusion, ProMediate provides a rigorous,
theory-grounded testbed to advance the development of proactive, socially
intelligent agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address scarcity of annotated datasets and limited domain knowledge in general-purpose models for low-resource language domain-specific QA.

Method: Multi-stage finetuning strategy using synthetic QA pairs generated by large LLMs (LLaMA-70B, Phi-14B) to augment limited original dataset, with exploration of various training methodologies.

Result: Large models efficiently generate synthetic data while small models effectively adapt to it, enabling domain generalization in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: Provides scalable pathway for low-resource, domain-specific question answering through synthetic data augmentation and lightweight model adaptation.

Abstract: Domain-specific question answering in low-resource languages faces two key
challenges: scarcity of annotated datasets and limited domain knowledge in
general-purpose language models. In this work, we present a multi-stage
finetuning strategy to adapt lightweight language models to the Hindi tourism
domain by leveraging both original and synthetic training data. Synthetic
question-answer pairs are generated using large LLMs (LLaMA-70B, Phi-14B) and
used to augment the limited original dataset. We explore several training
methodologies and analyse their impact on domain generalisation. Our results
demonstrate that large models can efficiently generate synthetic data, while
small models can effectively adapt to it, offering a scalable pathway for
low-resource, domain-specific QA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PEKD is a unified framework that enhances parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods for multimodal sarcasm detection in low-resource settings by distilling knowledge from an expert teacher model trained on large-scale data, using an entropy-aware gating mechanism to dynamically adjust distillation strength based on teacher confidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal sarcasm detection is challenging in low-resource settings due to scarce annotated data, making it difficult to learn subtle image-text contradictions. Existing PEFT methods reduce overfitting but struggle to reach optimal performance with limited supervision from few-shot data.

Method: Propose PEKD framework that enhances PEFT methods via distillation from an expert teacher model trained on large-scale sarcasm data. Introduce an entropy-aware gating mechanism that dynamically adjusts distillation strength based on teacher confidence to mitigate unreliable signals.

Result: Experiments on two public datasets show PEKD enables PEFT methods to outperform both prior parameter-efficient approaches and large multimodal models, achieving strong results in few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: The PEKD framework is modular and adaptable to a wide range of multimodal models and tasks, providing an effective solution for parameter-efficient fine-tuning in low-resource multimodal settings.

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection is challenging, especially in low-resource
settings where subtle image-text contradictions are hard to learn due to scarce
annotated data, which hinders the model's performance. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like adapters, LoRA, and prompt tuning reduce
overfitting but struggle to reach optimal performance due to limited
supervision from few-shot data. We propose PEKD, a unified framework that
enhances PEFT methods via distillation from an expert model trained on
large-scale sarcasm data, which acts as the teacher. To mitigate unreliable
signals from the teacher, we introduce an entropy-aware gating mechanism that
dynamically adjusts the distillation strength based on teacher confidence.
Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our PEKD framework enables
PEFT methods to outperform both prior parameter-efficient approaches and large
multimodal models, achieving strong results in the few-shot scenario. The
framework is modular and adaptable to a wide range of multimodal models and

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Parrot is a novel training pipeline that enables mutual enhancement between Natural Language Chain-of-Thought (N-CoT) and Program Chain-of-Thought (P-CoT) for mathematical reasoning, achieving simultaneous improvements in both paradigms through integrated subtasks and hybrid training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research typically focuses on unidirectional enhancement between N-CoT and P-CoT paradigms. The authors seek to fully unleash both paradigms' strengths for mutual enhancement and achieve simultaneous improvements in mathematical reasoning.

Method: 1) Three target-designed subtasks integrate sequential P-CoT and N-CoT generation. 2) A subtask hybrid training strategy to facilitate natural language semantic transferability. 3) Converted N-CoT auxiliary reward to alleviate sparse rewards in P-CoT optimization.

Result: Parrot significantly enhances both N-CoT and P-CoT performance, especially on N-CoT. Using Parrot SFT, LLaMA2 and CodeLLaMA achieve gains of +21.87 and +21.48 on MathQA over the RL baseline, which is resource-intensive.

Conclusion: The proposed Parrot pipeline successfully enables mutual enhancement between N-CoT and P-CoT paradigms, achieving substantial performance improvements in mathematical reasoning while being more efficient than resource-intensive RL baselines.

Abstract: Natural language chain-of-thought (N-CoT) and Program chain-of-thought
(P-CoT) have emerged as two primary paradigms for large language models (LLMs)
to solve mathematical reasoning problems. Current research typically endeavors
to achieve unidirectional enhancement: P-CoT enhanced N-CoT or N-CoT enhanced
P-CoT. In this paper, we seek to fully unleash the two paradigms' strengths for
mutual enhancement and ultimately achieve simultaneous improvements. We conduct
a detailed analysis of the error types across two paradigms, based on which we
propose Parrot, a novel training pipeline for mathematical problems: 1) Three
target-designed subtasks integrate sequential P-CoT and N-CoT generation. 2) A
subtask hybrid training strategy to facilitate natural language semantic
transferability. 3) The converted N-CoT auxiliary reward is designed to
alleviate the sparse rewards in P-CoT optimization. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Parrot significantly enhances both the performance of N-CoT
and P-CoT, especially on N-CoT. Using Parrot SFT, the N-CoT performance of
LLaMA2 and CodeLLaMA achieve gains of +21.87 and +21.48 on MathQA over the RL
baseline, which is resource-intensive.

TL;DR: CRMWeaver enhances business agents for complex data environments using synthesis data generation, RL training, and shared memories mechanism, achieving competitive results on CRMArena-Pro dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Business agents face challenges with intricate data relationships and heterogeneous tasks in complex real-world settings, requiring improved handling of complex data and varied tasks.

Method: Uses synthesis data generation and RL-based training paradigm, plus shared memories mechanism during inference to learn from similar task guidelines.

Result: Lightweight model achieves competitive results on CRMArena-Pro dataset in both B2B and B2C business scenarios.

Conclusion: CRMWeaver demonstrates practical value for real-world applications by effectively handling complex business environments and improving generalization in unseen scenarios.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of LLM-based agents, which
shed light on using language agents to solve complex real-world problems. A
prominent application lies in business agents, which interact with databases
and internal knowledge bases via tool calls to fulfill diverse user
requirements. However, this domain is characterized by intricate data
relationships and a wide range of heterogeneous tasks, from statistical data
queries to knowledge-based question-answering. To address these challenges, we
propose CRMWeaver, a novel approach that enhances business agents in such
complex settings. To acclimate the agentic model to intricate business
environments, we employ a synthesis data generation and RL-based paradigm
during training, which significantly improves the model's ability to handle
complex data and varied tasks. During inference, a shared memories mechanism is
introduced, prompting the agent to learn from task guidelines in similar
problems, thereby further boosting its effectiveness and generalization,
especially in unseen scenarios. We validate the efficacy of our approach on the
CRMArena-Pro dataset, where our lightweight model achieves competitive results
in both B2B and B2C business scenarios, underscoring its practical value for
real-world applications.

*Abhishek Purushothama,Junghyun Min,Brandon Waldon,Nathan Schneider*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper argues against using large language models (LLMs) for legal interpretation, showing they provide unstable judgments and have weak correlation with human legal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To empirically test whether LLMs can reliably assist in legal interpretation, given recent proposals to use them in legal practice.

Method: Investigated LLM performance on legal interpretation tasks in English, testing different question formats and comparing model outputs with human judgment.

Result: Models showed unstable interpretive judgments (different conclusions with varied question formats) and weak to moderate correlation with human judgment, with high variance across models and question variants.

Conclusion: It is dangerous to give much credence to LLM-generated conclusions for legal interpretation due to their instability and poor correlation with human reasoning.

Abstract: Legal interpretation frequently involves assessing how a legal text, as
understood by an 'ordinary' speaker of the language, applies to the set of
facts characterizing a legal dispute in the U.S. judicial system. Recent
scholarship has proposed that legal practitioners add large language models
(LLMs) to their interpretive toolkit. This work offers an empirical argument
against LLM interpretation as recently practiced by legal scholars and federal
judges. Our investigation in English shows that models do not provide stable
interpretive judgments: varying the question format can lead the model to
wildly different conclusions. Moreover, the models show weak to moderate
correlation with human judgment, with large variance across model and question
variant, suggesting that it is dangerous to give much credence to the
conclusions produced by generative AI.

Motivation: To investigate whether small-scale language models can benefit from instruction tuning and understand the trade-offs between interaction-focused adaptation and broad linguistic generalization.

Method: Compared conversational and question-answering instruction tuning datasets applied in merged or sequential curriculum using decoder-only models with 100M and 140M parameters. Evaluated across fine-tuning (SuperGLUE) and zero-shot (BLiMP, EWoK, WUGs, entity tracking, psycholinguistic correlation) settings.

Result: Instruction tuning yields small but consistent gains in fine-tuning scenarios, with sequential curricula outperforming merged data. However, improvements do not consistently transfer to zero-shot tasks.

Conclusion: There's a trade-off between interaction-focused adaptation and broad linguistic generalization.

TL;DR: A data-driven pipeline using LLMs to identify technological convergence patterns for forecasting transformative technologies, validated on arXiv preprints and USPTO patents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional expert-based methods struggle with fast-evolving ICT domains due to short innovation cycles and ambiguous early-stage terminology, creating a need for automated monitoring of transformative technologies.

Method: Leverages LLMs to extract semantic triples from text, constructs technology entity graphs, uses noun stapling for grouping similar terms, and applies graph-based metrics with multi-stage filtering and temporal trend analysis.

Result: Validated on 278,625 arXiv preprints (2017-2024) and 9,793 USPTO patents (2018-2024), successfully identifying both established and emerging convergence patterns.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable and generalizable framework for technology forecasting through full-text analysis, offering improved monitoring of transformative technology emergence.

Abstract: Forecasting transformative technologies remains a critical but challenging
task, particularly in fast-evolving domains such as Information and
Communication Technologies (ICTs). Traditional expert-based methods struggle to
keep pace with short innovation cycles and ambiguous early-stage terminology.
In this work, we propose a novel, data-driven pipeline to monitor the emergence
of transformative technologies by identifying patterns of technological
convergence.
  Our approach leverages advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract
semantic triples from unstructured text and construct a large-scale graph of
technology-related entities and relations. We introduce a new method for
grouping semantically similar technology terms (noun stapling) and develop
graph-based metrics to detect convergence signals. The pipeline includes
multi-stage filtering, domain-specific keyword clustering, and a temporal trend
analysis of topic co-occurence.
  We validate our methodology on two complementary datasets: 278,625 arXiv
preprints (2017--2024) to capture early scientific signals, and 9,793 USPTO
patent applications (2018-2024) to track downstream commercial developments.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline can identify both
established and emerging convergence patterns, offering a scalable and
generalizable framework for technology forecasting grounded in full-text
analysis.

*Junichiro Niimi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates how citation count affects hallucination rates in LLM-generated bibliographic references, finding that highly cited papers show lower hallucination rates and are nearly verbatimly memorized beyond ~1,000 citations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the major issue of LLMs hallucinating non-existent papers in bibliographic recommendations, and to understand how training data redundancy (measured via citation count) affects factual accuracy.

Method: Used GPT-4.1 to generate 100 bibliographic records across 20 computer-science domains, manually verified them, and measured factual consistency using cosine similarity between generated and authentic metadata.

Result: Hallucination rates vary across research domains; citation count is strongly correlated with factual accuracy; bibliographic information becomes almost verbatimly memorized beyond approximately 1,000 citations.

Conclusion: Highly cited papers are nearly verbatimly retained in LLMs, indicating a threshold where generalization shifts into memorization, with citation count serving as a proxy for training data redundancy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range
of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they
have also been used to assist in bibliographic recommendation, the
hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior
studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce
bibliographic information depends on whether the underlying knowledge is
generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear
in the training corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume
citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency
with which a given bibliographic record is repeatedly represented in the
pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated
references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified
100 bibliographic records across twenty computer-science domains, and measured
factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic
metadata. The results revealed that (i) hallucination rates vary across
research domains, (ii) citation count is strongly correlated with factual
accuracy, and (iii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatimly
memorized beyond approximately 1,000 citations. These findings suggest that
highly cited papers are nearly verbatimly retained in the model, indicating a
threshold where generalization shifts into memorization.

Motivation: Existing benchmarks are largely Anglocentric and domain-agnostic, limiting their applicability to India-centric contexts, creating a need for domain and culture specific evaluation of large language models.

Method: Created BhashaBench V1 with 74,166 curated question-answer pairs (52,494 English, 21,672 Hindi) sourced from authentic government and domain-specific exams, spanning 4 major domains with 90+ subdomains and 500+ topics.

Result: Evaluation of 29+ LLMs revealed significant domain and language specific performance gaps. GPT-4o achieved 76.49% accuracy in Legal but only 59.74% in Ayurveda. Models consistently performed better on English content compared to Hindi across all domains.

Conclusion: BhashaBench V1 provides a comprehensive dataset for evaluating LLMs across India's diverse knowledge domains and enables assessment of models' ability to integrate domain-specific knowledge with bilingual understanding.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models(LLMs) has intensified the need
for domain and culture specific evaluation. Existing benchmarks are largely
Anglocentric and domain-agnostic, limiting their applicability to India-centric
contexts. To address this gap, we introduce BhashaBench V1, the first
domain-specific, multi-task, bilingual benchmark focusing on critical Indic
knowledge systems. BhashaBench V1 contains 74,166 meticulously curated
question-answer pairs, with 52,494 in English and 21,672 in Hindi, sourced from
authentic government and domain-specific exams. It spans four major domains:
Agriculture, Legal, Finance, and Ayurveda, comprising 90+ subdomains and
covering 500+ topics, enabling fine-grained evaluation. Evaluation of 29+ LLMs
reveals significant domain and language specific performance gaps, with
especially large disparities in low-resource domains. For instance, GPT-4o
achieves 76.49% overall accuracy in Legal but only 59.74% in Ayurveda. Models
consistently perform better on English content compared to Hindi across all
domains. Subdomain-level analysis shows that areas such as Cyber Law,
International Finance perform relatively well, while Panchakarma, Seed Science,
and Human Rights remain notably weak. BhashaBench V1 provides a comprehensive
dataset for evaluating large language models across India's diverse knowledge
domains. It enables assessment of models' ability to integrate domain-specific

TL;DR: Symphony is a new LLM serving system that serves programs (LIPs) instead of prompts, enabling runtime customization of token prediction and KV cache management, and offloading application logic to the server.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM serving systems are inefficient and inflexible for complex applications due to their text completion focus and rigid design.

Method: Proposes an architecture where LLM Inference Programs (LIPs) allow runtime customization and server-side logic offloading. Symphony implements this as an operating system for LIPs with system calls for LLM computations, virtualized KV cache via file system, and two-level process scheduling.

Result: Symphony enables more efficient and extensible LLM application ecosystem by serving programs rather than prompts.

Conclusion: Symphony's program-based serving architecture opens the door to more efficient and extensible LLM applications compared to traditional prompt-based systems.

Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) serving systems, primarily designed for
text completion, are neither efficient nor adaptable for increasingly complex
LLM applications due to their inflexible design. We propose a new LLM serving
system architecture that serves programs instead of prompts to address this
problem. These programs, called LLM Inference Programs (LIPs), allow users to
customize token prediction and KV cache management at runtime and to offload
parts of their application logic, such as tool execution, to the server. We
describe an example of this architecture through a system named Symphony, which
functions as an operating system for LIPs. Symphony exposes LLM model
computations via system calls and virtualizes KV cache with a dedicated file
system, while ensuring GPU efficiency with a two-level process scheduling
scheme. Symphony has the potential to open the door to a more efficient and
extensible ecosystem for LLM applications.

*Shakib Yazdani,Yasser Hamidullah,Cristina España-Bonet,Josef van Genabith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces an automated VLM-based framework for sign language dataset annotation and filtering, applied to TikTok videos across 8 sign languages to reduce manual annotation costs while maintaining data quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SLT datasets are limited in scale, lack multilingual coverage, and are costly due to expert annotation requirements. VLMs show promise but remain untapped for sign language dataset acquisition.

Method: A VLM-based pipeline with face visibility detection, sign activity recognition, text extraction from videos, and validation of video-text alignment. Applied to TikTok videos across 8 sign languages and YouTube-SL-25 dataset.

Result: Created TikTok-SL-8 corpus and evaluated two off-the-shelf SLT models on filtered German and American Sign Language data, establishing baselines for automatically extracted noisy data.

Conclusion: The framework enables scalable, weakly supervised pretraining for SLT and facilitates data acquisition from social media platforms, reducing reliance on manual annotation.

Abstract: Most existing sign language translation (SLT) datasets are limited in scale,
lack multilingual coverage, and are costly to curate due to their reliance on
expert annotation and controlled recording setup. Recently, Vision Language
Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities as evaluators and real-time
assistants. Despite these advancements, their potential remains untapped in the
context of sign language dataset acquisition. To bridge this gap, we introduce
the first automated annotation and filtering framework that utilizes VLMs to
reduce reliance on manual effort while preserving data quality. Our method is
applied to TikTok videos across eight sign languages and to the already curated
YouTube-SL-25 dataset in German Sign Language for the purpose of additional
evaluation. Our VLM-based pipeline includes a face visibility detection, a sign
activity recognition, a text extraction from video content, and a judgment step
to validate alignment between video and text, implementing generic filtering,
annotation and validation steps. Using the resulting corpus, TikTok-SL-8, we
assess the performance of two off-the-shelf SLT models on our filtered dataset
for German and American Sign Languages, with the goal of establishing baselines
and evaluating the robustness of recent models on automatically extracted,
slightly noisy data. Our work enables scalable, weakly supervised pretraining
for SLT and facilitates data acquisition from social media.

### [44] [Implicature in Interaction: Understanding Implicature Improves Alignment in Human-LLM Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25426)
*Asutosh Hota,Jussi P. P. Jokinen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines how Large Language Models handle implicature (context-driven meaning) in human-AI interaction, finding that larger models better approximate human understanding and that implicature-based prompts improve response quality across all models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance human-computer interaction by focusing on linguistic foundations, particularly implicature, which is essential for human-AI alignment and making interactions more natural and contextually grounded.

Method: Examined LLMs' ability to infer user intent embedded in context-driven prompts and whether understanding implicature improves response generation, comparing different model sizes.

Result: Larger models approximate human interpretations more closely, while smaller models struggle with implicature inference. Implicature-based prompts significantly enhance perceived relevance and quality of responses across models, with 67.6% of participants preferring them over literal prompts.

Conclusion: Linguistic theory, specifically implicature understanding, can be used to address the alignment problem by making human-AI interaction more natural and contextually grounded, with clear user preference for contextually nuanced communication.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) is positioning language
at the core of human-computer interaction (HCI). We argue that advancing HCI
requires attention to the linguistic foundations of interaction, particularly
implicature (meaning conveyed beyond explicit statements through shared
context) which is essential for human-AI (HAI) alignment. This study examines
LLMs' ability to infer user intent embedded in context-driven prompts and
whether understanding implicature improves response generation. Results show
that larger models approximate human interpretations more closely, while
smaller models struggle with implicature inference. Furthermore,
implicature-based prompts significantly enhance the perceived relevance and
quality of responses across models, with notable gains in smaller models.
Overall, 67.6% of participants preferred responses with implicature-embedded
prompts to literal ones, highlighting a clear preference for contextually
nuanced communication. Our work contributes to understanding how linguistic
theory can be used to address the alignment problem by making HAI interaction
more natural and contextually grounded.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLMEval is a new evaluation suite for neural theorem proving and proof autoformalization that uses research-level mathematics from real Lean formalization projects, revealing a significant performance gap with current models achieving only 10.3% pass rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs perform well on curated benchmarks but have limited practical impact on research-level neural theorem proving and proof autoformalization, necessitating more realistic evaluation.

Method: Created RLMEval evaluation suite using 613 theorems from 6 real Lean Blueprint formalization projects to assess neural theorem proving and proof autoformalization capabilities.

Result: Evaluation shows state-of-the-art models achieve only 10.3% pass rate on RLMEval, indicating progress on existing benchmarks doesn't translate to realistic research-level mathematics.

Conclusion: RLMEval provides a challenging benchmark to guide and accelerate progress in automated reasoning for formal mathematics by focusing on real-world research-level problems.

Abstract: Despite impressive results on curated benchmarks, the practical impact of
large language models (LLMs) on research-level neural theorem proving and proof
autoformalization is still limited. We introduce RLMEval, an evaluation suite
for these tasks, focusing on research-level mathematics from real-world Lean
formalization projects. RLMEval targets the evaluation of neural theorem
proving and proof autoformalization on challenging research-level theorems by
leveraging real Lean Blueprint formalization projects. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art models on RLMEval, comprising 613 theorems from 6 Lean
projects, reveals a significant gap: progress on existing benchmarks does not
readily translate to these more realistic settings, with the best model
achieving only a 10.3 % pass rate. RLMEval provides a new, challenging
benchmark designed to guide and accelerate progress in automated reasoning for
formal mathematics.

### [46] [Depth and Autonomy: A Framework for Evaluating LLM Applications in Social Science Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25432)
*Ali Sanaei,Ali Rajabzadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for using LLMs in qualitative social science research that classifies applications by interpretive depth and autonomy, recommending task decomposition and limited autonomy to maintain reliability and transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address persistent challenges in LLM adoption for qualitative social science, including interpretive bias, low reliability, and weak auditability.

Method: Introduce a classification framework based on interpretive depth and autonomy dimensions, analyze existing literature from Web of Science, and recommend task decomposition approach similar to delegating to research assistants.

Result: Framework provides practical design recommendations for LLM usage, showing that maintaining low autonomy and selectively increasing interpretive depth under supervision can balance benefits with reliability.

Conclusion: Rather than granting models expansive freedom, researchers should decompose tasks into manageable segments with limited autonomy to plausibly reap LLM benefits while preserving transparency and reliability in qualitative research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized by researchers across
a wide range of domains, and qualitative social science is no exception;
however, this adoption faces persistent challenges, including interpretive
bias, low reliability, and weak auditability. We introduce a framework that
situates LLM usage along two dimensions, interpretive depth and autonomy,
thereby offering a straightforward way to classify LLM applications in
qualitative research and to derive practical design recommendations. We present
the state of the literature with respect to these two dimensions, based on all
published social science papers available on Web of Science that use LLMs as a
tool and not strictly as the subject of study. Rather than granting models
expansive freedom, our approach encourages researchers to decompose tasks into
manageable segments, much as they would when delegating work to capable
undergraduate research assistants. By maintaining low levels of autonomy and
selectively increasing interpretive depth only where warranted and under
supervision, one can plausibly reap the benefits of LLMs while preserving
transparency and reliability.

*Shakib Yazdani,Yasser Hamidullah,Cristina España-Bonet,Eleftherios Avramidis,Josef van Genabith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the limitations of text-based evaluation metrics for sign language translation (SLT), analyzing six conventional metrics and LLM-based evaluators under paraphrasing, hallucinations, and sentence length variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SLT evaluation relies on text-based metrics like BLEU and ROUGE, but it's unclear how well these capture SLT quality. The gap in understanding text-based metrics' reliability for SLT motivates this investigation.

Method: Analyzed six text-based metrics (BLEU, chrF, ROUGE, BLEURT) and LLM-based evaluators (G-Eval, GEMBA) under three controlled conditions: paraphrasing, hallucinations in outputs, and sentence length variations.

Result: Lexical overlap metrics have significant limitations. LLM-based evaluators better capture semantic equivalence but show bias toward LLM-paraphrased translations. All metrics detect hallucinations, but BLEU is overly sensitive while BLEURT and LLM evaluators are lenient toward subtle cases.

Conclusion: Text-based metrics alone are insufficient for SLT evaluation. There is a need for multimodal evaluation frameworks that extend beyond text-based metrics to enable more holistic assessment of SLT outputs.

Abstract: Automatic evaluation metrics are crucial for advancing sign language
translation (SLT). Current SLT evaluation metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE, are
only text-based, and it remains unclear to what extent text-based metrics can
reliably capture the quality of SLT outputs. To address this gap, we
investigate the limitations of text-based SLT evaluation metrics by analyzing
six metrics, including BLEU, chrF, and ROUGE, as well as BLEURT on the one
hand, and large language model (LLM)-based evaluators such as G-Eval and GEMBA
zero-shot direct assessment on the other hand. Specifically, we assess the
consistency and robustness of these metrics under three controlled conditions:
paraphrasing, hallucinations in model outputs, and variations in sentence
length. Our analysis highlights the limitations of lexical overlap metrics and
demonstrates that while LLM-based evaluators better capture semantic
equivalence often missed by conventional metrics, they can also exhibit bias
toward LLM-paraphrased translations. Moreover, although all metrics are able to
detect hallucinations, BLEU tends to be overly sensitive, whereas BLEURT and
LLM-based evaluators are comparatively lenient toward subtle cases. This
motivates the need for multimodal evaluation frameworks that extend beyond
text-based metrics to enable a more holistic assessment of SLT outputs.

*Fei Wei,Daoyuan Chen,Ce Wang,Yilun Huang,Yushuo Chen,Xuchen Pan,Yaliang Li,Bolin Ding*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Learn-to-Ask is a simulator-free framework that trains proactive dialogue agents directly from offline expert data by leveraging observed future trajectories to infer dense, turn-by-turn rewards, decomposing long-horizon problems into supervised learning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for training proactive LLMs either optimize single-turn attributes myopically or rely on brittle user simulators, creating a 'reality gap' that prevents effective deployment in high-stakes domains.

Method: Reframes offline policy learning using observed future trajectories to infer dense rewards, trains policies to output structured (action, state_assessment) tuples, and uses Automated Grader Calibration to purge noise from LLM-based reward models with minimal human supervision.

Result: Successfully deployed in a real-world medical dataset with LLMs up to 32B, achieving performance superior to human experts in live, large-scale online AI service evaluations.

Conclusion: Provides a practical blueprint for transforming passive LLMs into proactive, goal-oriented applications that can translate offline data into tangible real-world impact.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel as passive responders, but teaching them
to be proactive, goal-oriented partners, a critical capability in high-stakes
domains, remains a major challenge. Current paradigms either myopically
optimize single-turn attributes or rely on brittle, high-cost user simulators,
creating a persistent ``reality gap''. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\texttt{Learn-to-Ask}, a general, simulator-free framework for learning and
deploying proactive dialogue agents \textit{directly from offline expert data},
bypassing the need to model complex user dynamics. Our key insight is to
reframe the offline policy learning problem by leveraging the \textbf{observed
future} of each expert trajectory. This allows us to infer a dense,
turn-by-turn reward signal grounded in the expert's revealed strategy,
decomposing the intractable long-horizon problem into a series of supervised
learning tasks, and training a policy to output a structured \texttt{(action,
state_assessment)} tuple, governing both \textbf{what to ask} and, crucially,
\textbf{when to stop}. To ensure reward fidelity, our Automated Grader
Calibration pipeline systematically purges noise from the LLM-based reward
model with minimal human supervision. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy
of \texttt{Learn-to-Ask} in a real-world medical dataset, using LLMs of varying
sizes up to 32B. Our approach culminates in the successful deployment of LLMs
into a live, large-scale online AI service. In rigorous in-house evaluations,
our model was launched and achieved performance even superior to human experts,
proving our framework's ability to translate offline data into tangible,
real-world impact. We hope this work provides a practical and economically
viable blueprint for transforming passive LLMs into proactive, goal-oriented
LLM applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges posed by rapidly evolving sub-cultural languages and slang that complicate automated information extraction and law enforcement monitoring.

Method: Fine-tune LLMs using LLaMA Factory framework on both general-purpose and custom domain-specific datasets (political and security domains), integrating with named entity recognition (NER).

Result: Instruction fine-tuning significantly enhances summarization and tagging accuracy, especially for specialized corpora. LLaMA3-8B-Instruct outperforms Chinese-trained counterpart after domain-specific fine-tuning, showing reasoning capabilities transfer across languages.

Conclusion: The pipeline enables concise summaries and structured entity tagging for rapid document categorization, proving scalable and adaptable for real-time applications in information management and security operations.

Abstract: This paper presents a pipeline integrating fine-tuned large language models
(LLMs) with named entity recognition (NER) for efficient domain-specific text
summarization and tagging. The authors address the challenge posed by rapidly
evolving sub-cultural languages and slang, which complicate automated
information extraction and law enforcement monitoring. By leveraging the LLaMA
Factory framework, the study fine-tunes LLMs on both generalpurpose and custom
domain-specific datasets, particularly in the political and security domains.
The models are evaluated using BLEU and ROUGE metrics, demonstrating that
instruction fine-tuning significantly enhances summarization and tagging
accuracy, especially for specialized corpora. Notably, the LLaMA3-8B-Instruct
model, despite its initial limitations in Chinese comprehension, outperforms
its Chinese-trained counterpart after domainspecific fine-tuning, suggesting
that underlying reasoning capabilities can transfer across languages. The
pipeline enables concise summaries and structured entity tagging, facilitating
rapid document categorization and distribution. This approach proves scalable
and adaptable for real-time applications, supporting efficient information
management and the ongoing need to capture emerging language trends. The
integration of LLMs and NER offers a robust solution for transforming
unstructured text into actionable insights, crucial for modern knowledge
management and security operations.

*Bangde Du,Minghao Guo,Songming He,Ziyi Ye,Xi Zhu,Weihang Su,Shuqi Zhu,Yujia Zhou,Yongfeng Zhang,Qingyao Ai,Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TwinVoice is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating persona simulation in LLMs across social, interpersonal, and narrative contexts, assessing six key capabilities where current models still lag behind human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of LLM-based persona simulation are limited by reliance on synthetic dialogues, lack of systematic frameworks, and insufficient analysis of capability requirements.

Method: The TwinVoice benchmark assesses persona simulation across three dimensions (Social, Interpersonal, Narrative) and evaluates six fundamental capabilities: opinion consistency, memory recall, logical reasoning, lexical fidelity, persona tone, and syntactic style.

Result: Advanced LLMs achieve moderate accuracy in persona simulation but significantly underperform in capabilities like syntactic style and memory recall, with average performance remaining considerably below human baseline.

Conclusion: While LLMs show emerging persona simulation capabilities, there are significant gaps in key areas like syntactic style and memory recall, indicating the need for further development to achieve human-level performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are exhibiting emergent human-like abilities and
are increasingly envisioned as the foundation for simulating an individual's
communication style, behavioral tendencies, and personality traits. However,
current evaluations of LLM-based persona simulation remain limited: most rely
on synthetic dialogues, lack systematic frameworks, and lack analysis of the
capability requirement. To address these limitations, we introduce TwinVoice, a
comprehensive benchmark for assessing persona simulation across diverse
real-world contexts. TwinVoice encompasses three dimensions: Social Persona
(public social interactions), Interpersonal Persona (private dialogues), and
Narrative Persona (role-based expression). It further decomposes the evaluation
of LLM performance into six fundamental capabilities, including opinion
consistency, memory recall, logical reasoning, lexical fidelity, persona tone,
and syntactic style. Experimental results reveal that while advanced models
achieve moderate accuracy in persona simulation, they still fall short of
capabilities such as syntactic style and memory recall. Consequently, the
average performance achieved by LLMs remains considerably below the human
baseline.

*Run Peng,Ziqiao Ma,Amy Pang,Sikai Li,Zhang Xi-Jia,Yingzhuo Yu,Cristian-Paul Bara,Joyce Chai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores LLM agent collaboration in task completion under information asymmetry, using extended Einstein Puzzles to study how agents reason, communicate, and act together to solve spatial and relational constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLM agents are often studied for individual action planning, their collaborative abilities to achieve joint goals under information asymmetry (where agents have different knowledge and skills) remain underexplored.

Method: The authors extend Einstein Puzzles to a table-top game where two LLM agents collaborate. They apply a fine-tuning-plus-verifier framework with various communication strategies and environmental verification signals to enhance agent collaboration.

Result: Empirical results show aligned communication is crucial, especially when agents have both information-seeking and -providing capabilities. Agents without communication can achieve high task performance but lack true rule understanding and receive lower trust from human evaluators.

Conclusion: Integrating environment-based verifiers enhances agents' ability to comprehend task rules and complete tasks, promoting safer and more interpretable collaboration in AI systems.

Abstract: While Large Language Model (LLM) agents are often approached from the angle
of action planning/generation to accomplish a goal (e.g., given by language
descriptions), their abilities to collaborate with each other to achieve a
joint goal are not well explored. To address this limitation, this paper
studies LLM agents in task collaboration, particularly under the condition of
information asymmetry, where agents have disparities in their knowledge and
skills and need to work together to complete a shared task. We extend Einstein
Puzzles, a classical symbolic puzzle, to a table-top game. In this game, two
LLM agents must reason, communicate, and act to satisfy spatial and relational
constraints required to solve the puzzle. We apply a fine-tuning-plus-verifier
framework in which LLM agents are equipped with various communication
strategies and verification signals from the environment. Empirical results
highlight the critical importance of aligned communication, especially when
agents possess both information-seeking and -providing capabilities.
Interestingly, agents without communication can still achieve high task
performance; however, further analysis reveals a lack of true rule
understanding and lower trust from human evaluators. Instead, by integrating an
environment-based verifier, we enhance agents' ability to comprehend task rules
and complete tasks, promoting both safer and more interpretable collaboration
in AI systems. https://github.com/Roihn/EinsteinPuzzles

TL;DR: FARSIQA is a novel system for faithful Persian Islamic question answering that uses an adaptive, iterative RAG framework to handle complex multi-hop queries, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 97.0% negative rejection and 74.3% answer correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG systems fail on complex multi-hop queries in specialized domains like religious QA, particularly for Persian-speaking Muslims where accuracy and faithfulness to authoritative sources are critical.

Method: FAIR-RAG architecture: a Faithful, Adaptive, Iterative Refinement framework that dynamically decomposes queries, assesses evidence sufficiency, and iteratively generates sub-queries to fill information gaps using a curated knowledge base of over 1M Islamic documents.

Result: Achieved 97.0% in Negative Rejection (40-point improvement over baselines) and 74.3% Answer Correctness on the IslamicPCQA benchmark, demonstrating superior performance.

Conclusion: FARSIQA establishes a new standard for Persian Islamic QA and validates that iterative, adaptive architectures are crucial for building faithful, reliable AI systems in sensitive domains.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Natural
Language Processing, yet their application in high-stakes, specialized domains
like religious question answering is hindered by challenges like hallucination
and unfaithfulness to authoritative sources. This issue is particularly
critical for the Persian-speaking Muslim community, where accuracy and
trustworthiness are paramount. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
systems, relying on simplistic single-pass pipelines, fall short on complex,
multi-hop queries requiring multi-step reasoning and evidence aggregation. To
address this gap, we introduce FARSIQA, a novel, end-to-end system for Faithful
Advanced Question Answering in the Persian Islamic domain. FARSIQA is built
upon our innovative FAIR-RAG architecture: a Faithful, Adaptive, Iterative
Refinement framework for RAG. FAIR-RAG employs a dynamic, self-correcting
process: it adaptively decomposes complex queries, assesses evidence
sufficiency, and enters an iterative loop to generate sub-queries,
progressively filling information gaps. Operating on a curated knowledge base
of over one million authoritative Islamic documents, FARSIQA demonstrates
superior performance. Rigorous evaluation on the challenging IslamicPCQA
benchmark shows state-of-the-art performance: the system achieves a remarkable
97.0% in Negative Rejection - a 40-point improvement over baselines - and a
high Answer Correctness score of 74.3%. Our work establishes a new standard for
Persian Islamic QA and validates that our iterative, adaptive architecture is
crucial for building faithful, reliable AI systems in sensitive domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While TTS has proven effective in formal domains like mathematics and programming, its value in argumentative domains such as law remains underexplored.

Method: The study uses verifier-based TTS methods including outcome-level (Best-of-N) and process-level (tree search) verification, evaluated across five legal MCQA benchmarks with a family of 7 reward models under low-N budgets.

Result: The analysis systematically investigates how verifier utility is affected by key properties including domain specialization, model size, and supervision type (process-supervised PRMs vs. outcome-only ORMs), even when applied across different roles.

Conclusion: The research provides empirical evidence on the effectiveness of TTS techniques in legal domains, examining critical factors that influence verifier performance in argumentative reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) techniques can improve the performance of large
language models (LLMs) at the expense of additional computation and latency.
While TTS has proven effective in formal domains such as mathematics and
programming \citep{snell2024scaling, chen2024more}, its value in argumentative
domains such as law remains underexplored. We present an empirical study of
verifier-based TTS methods for legal multiple-choice QA (MCQA) across five
benchmarks. Using a family of 7 reward models, we evaluate both outcome-level
(Best-of-$N$) and process-level (tree search) verification under realistic
low-$N$ budgets. Our analysis systematically investigates how verifier utility
is affected by key properties such as domain specialization, model size, and
supervision type (process-supervised PRMs vs. outcome-only ORMs), even when

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to evaluate language model reasoning efficiency by measuring how well they avoid unnecessary inferences when solving problems with irrelevant information, using logic programming to align natural language proofs with shortest proofs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard evaluations focus on correctness but overlook efficiency, which is crucial for human-like reasoning where much available information is irrelevant and effective inference requires ignoring distractions.

Method: Introduces a framework using logic programming to align natural language proofs generated by LMs with shortest proofs, quantifying efficiency by measuring unnecessary inference avoidance. Constructs a dataset of math word problems with irrelevant axioms varying in semantic overlap.

Result: Current LMs show marked accuracy declines even with minimal domain-consistent distractions, and their generated proofs frequently exhibit detours through irrelevant inferences.

Conclusion: Language models struggle with reasoning efficiency, failing to effectively ignore irrelevant information and generating inefficient proofs with unnecessary detours.

Abstract: Modern language models (LMs) exhibit strong deductive reasoning capabilities,
yet standard evaluations emphasize correctness while overlooking a key aspect
of human-like reasoning: efficiency. In real-world reasoning scenarios, much of
the available information is irrelevant, and effective deductive inference
requires identifying and ignoring such distractions. We propose a framework for
assessing LM reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming,
introducing a simple method to align proofs written in natural language -- as
generated by an LM -- with shortest proofs found by executing the logic
program. Efficiency is quantified by measuring how well a model avoids
unnecessary inference. Empirically, we construct a dataset of math word
problems injected with various number of irrelevant axioms that vary in
semantic overlap with the goal theorem. We find that current LMs show marked
accuracy declines under such conditions -- even with minimal, domain-consistent
distractions -- and the proofs they generate frequently exhibit detours through
irrelevant inferences.

TL;DR: EHR-Ins is a large-scale EHR reasoning dataset with 300k reasoning cases and 4M non-reasoning cases across 42 tasks, enabling development of EHR-R1 LLMs that outperform state-of-the-art models including GPT-4o by over 30 points on MIMIC-Bench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated EHR analysis is critical for clinical decision-making, but current LLMs have limited EHR analysis capabilities due to narrow task coverage and lack of EHR-oriented reasoning capabilities.

Method: Created EHR-Ins dataset using thinking-graph-driven framework, developed EHR-R1 LLMs (up to 72B parameters) through multi-stage training including domain adaptation, reasoning enhancement, and reinforcement learning, and introduced EHR-Bench benchmark from MIMIC-IV.

Result: EHR-R1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art commercial and open-source LLMs, surpassing GPT-4o by over 30 points on MIMIC-Bench and achieving 10% higher zero-shot AUROC on EHRSHOT.

Conclusion: The EHR-Ins dataset, EHR-R1 models, and EHR-Bench benchmark collectively advance the development of more reliable and clinically relevant EHR analysis systems.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich yet complex information, and
their automated analysis is critical for clinical decision-making. Despite
recent advances of large language models (LLMs) in clinical workflows, their
ability to analyze EHRs remains limited due to narrow task coverage and lack of
EHR-oriented reasoning capabilities. This paper aims to bridge the gap,
specifically, we present EHR-Ins, a large-scale, comprehensive EHR reasoning
instruction dataset, comprising 300k high-quality reasoning cases and 4M
non-reasoning cases across 42 distinct EHR tasks. Its core innovation is a
thinking-graph-driven framework that enables to generate high-quality reasoning
data at scale. Based on it, we develop EHR-R1, a series of reasoning-enhanced
LLMs with up to 72B parameters tailored for EHR analysis. Through a multi-stage
training paradigm, including domain adaptation, reasoning enhancement, and
reinforcement learning, EHR-R1 systematically acquires domain knowledge and
diverse reasoning capabilities, enabling accurate and robust EHR analysis.
Lastly, we introduce EHR-Bench, a new benchmark curated from MIMIC-IV, spanning
42 tasks, to comprehensively assess reasoning and prediction across EHR
scenarios. In experiments, we show that the resulting EHR-R1 consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art commercial and open-source LLMs (including
DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o), surpassing GPT-4o by over 30 points on MIMIC-Bench and
achieving a 10\% higher zero-shot AUROC on EHRSHOT. Collectively, EHR-Ins,
EHR-R1, and EHR-Bench have significantly advanced the development for more
reliable and clinically relevant EHR analysis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PairUni is a unified framework that reorganizes vision-language data into understanding-generation pairs and uses Pair-GPRO optimization to balance both tasks during reinforcement learning, achieving improved performance on unified vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unified vision-language models must perform both understanding and generation tasks, but these tasks rely on heterogeneous data and supervision, making it difficult to balance them during reinforcement learning without task interference.

Method: Proposes PairUni framework that creates understanding-generation pairs by: 1) Using GPT-o3 to augment single-task data (captions for understanding, QA pairs for generation), 2) Retrieving semantically related examples to form pairs, and 3) Introducing Pair-GPRO optimization that assigns similarity scores to modulate advantages and reduce task interference.

Result: The approach achieves balanced improvements on various UVLMs, outperforming strong UVLM RL baselines. A high-quality dataset of 16K UG pairs named PairUG was curated for RL fine-tuning.

Conclusion: PairUni successfully addresses the challenge of balancing understanding and generation tasks in unified vision-language models through paired data structures and optimized reinforcement learning, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Unified vision-language models (UVLMs) must perform both understanding and
generation within a single architecture, but these tasks rely on heterogeneous
data and supervision, making it difficult to balance them during reinforcement
learning (RL). We propose PairUni, a unified framework that reorganizes data
into understanding-generation (UG) pairs and aligns optimization accordingly.
We first use GPT-o3 to augment single-task data, generating captions for
understanding samples and question-answer (QA) pairs for generation samples,
forming aligned pairs from the same instance. Additionally, for each generation
sample, we retrieve a semantically related understanding example to form a
retrieved pair, linking different but related data points. These paired
structures expose cross-task semantic correspondences and support consistent
policy learning. To leverage this structure, we present Pair-GPRO, a pair-aware
variant based on Group Relative Policy Optimization. It assigns a similarity
score to each pair to modulate the advantage, strengthening learning from
well-aligned examples and reducing task interference. We curate a high-quality
dataset of 16K UG pairs named PairUG for RL fine-tuning and evaluate PairUni on
the powerful Janus-Pro UVLMs. Our approach achieves balanced improvements on
various UVLMs, outperforming strong UVLM RL baselines. Code:

*Saeed AlMarri,Kristof Juhasz,Mathieu Ravaut,Gautier Marti,Hamdan Al Ahbabi,Ibrahim Elfadel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper compares zero-shot LLM classifiers with LightGBM for financial risk assessment, finding LLMs have limitations in structured data prediction and unreliable self-explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the suitability of LLMs as flexible alternatives to classical ML models for structured tabular data in high-stakes financial applications like loan default prediction.

Method: Systematic comparison between zero-shot LLM-based classifiers and LightGBM on real-world loan default prediction, using SHAP for feature attribution analysis and assessing LLM self-explanations.

Result: LLMs can identify key financial risk indicators but their feature importance rankings diverge from LightGBM, and their self-explanations often fail to align with empirical SHAP attributions.

Conclusion: LLMs have limitations as standalone models for structured financial risk prediction, requiring explainability audits, baseline comparisons with interpretable models, and human-in-the-loop oversight in risk-sensitive financial environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as flexible
alternatives to classical machine learning models for classification tasks
through zero-shot prompting. However, their suitability for structured tabular
data remains underexplored, especially in high-stakes financial applications
such as financial risk assessment. This study conducts a systematic comparison
between zero-shot LLM-based classifiers and LightGBM, a state-of-the-art
gradient-boosting model, on a real-world loan default prediction task. We
evaluate their predictive performance, analyze feature attributions using SHAP,
and assess the reliability of LLM-generated self-explanations. While LLMs are
able to identify key financial risk indicators, their feature importance
rankings diverge notably from LightGBM, and their self-explanations often fail
to align with empirical SHAP attributions. These findings highlight the
limitations of LLMs as standalone models for structured financial risk
prediction and raise concerns about the trustworthiness of their self-generated
explanations. Our results underscore the need for explainability audits,
baseline comparisons with interpretable models, and human-in-the-loop oversight
when deploying LLMs in risk-sensitive financial environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Toolathlon is a comprehensive benchmark for language agents that evaluates their ability to handle complex, multi-step workflows across 32 diverse software applications and 604 tools, with realistic environment states and execution-based evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing language agent benchmarks focus on narrow domains or simplified tasks, lacking the diversity, realism, and long-horizon complexity needed to evaluate real-world performance of language agents.

Method: Toolathlon spans 32 software applications and 604 tools using Model Context Protocol servers, provides realistic initial environment states from real software, and includes 108 manually crafted tasks requiring multi-App interactions over ~20 turns on average.

Result: State-of-the-art models show significant shortcomings: Claude-4.5-Sonnet achieves only 38.6% success rate with 20.2 tool calling turns, while top open-weights model DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp reaches 20.1% success rate.

Conclusion: Toolathlon is expected to drive development of more capable language agents for real-world, long-horizon task execution by providing a comprehensive benchmark that addresses current limitations in agent evaluation.

Abstract: Real-world language agents must handle complex, multi-step workflows across
diverse Apps. For instance, an agent may manage emails by coordinating with
calendars and file systems, or monitor a production database to detect
anomalies and generate reports following an operating manual. However, existing
language agent benchmarks often focus on narrow domains or simplified tasks
that lack the diversity, realism, and long-horizon complexity required to
evaluate agents' real-world performance. To address this gap, we introduce the
Tool Decathlon (dubbed as Toolathlon), a benchmark for language agents offering
diverse Apps and tools, realistic environment setup, and reliable
execution-based evaluation. Toolathlon spans 32 software applications and 604
tools, ranging from everyday platforms such as Google Calendar and Notion to
professional ones like WooCommerce, Kubernetes, and BigQuery. Most of the tools
are based on a high-quality set of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that we
may have revised or implemented ourselves. Unlike prior works, which primarily
ensure functional realism but offer limited environment state diversity, we
provide realistic initial environment states from real software, such as Canvas
courses with dozens of students or real financial spreadsheets. This benchmark
includes 108 manually sourced or crafted tasks in total, requiring interacting
with multiple Apps over around 20 turns on average to complete. Each task is
strictly verifiable through dedicated evaluation scripts. Comprehensive
evaluation of SOTA models highlights their significant shortcomings: the
best-performing model, Claude-4.5-Sonnet, achieves only a 38.6% success rate
with 20.2 tool calling turns on average, while the top open-weights model
DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp reaches 20.1%. We expect Toolathlon to drive the development
of more capable language agents for real-world, long-horizon task execution.

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether persuasive prompting can recall factual knowledge from deliberately unlearned LLMs, showing that persuasive prompts substantially enhance factual knowledge recall, with effectiveness inversely correlated to model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unlearning in large language models is crucial for managing sensitive data and correcting misinformation, but evaluating its effectiveness remains an open problem.

Method: The authors introduce Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior Framework (SKeB), which models information entanglement via domain graphs and tests whether factual recall in unlearned models is correlated with persuasive framing. They develop entanglement metrics to quantify knowledge activation patterns.

Result: Persuasive prompts substantially enhance factual knowledge recall (14.8% baseline vs. 24.5% with authority framing), with effectiveness inversely correlated to model size (128% recovery in 2.7B vs. 15% in 13B).

Conclusion: SKeB provides a foundation for assessing unlearning completeness, robustness, and overall behavior in LLMs.

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for managing sensitive
data and correcting misinformation, yet evaluating its effectiveness remains an
open problem. We investigate whether persuasive prompting can recall factual
knowledge from deliberately unlearned LLMs across models ranging from 2.7B to
13B parameters (OPT-2.7B, LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-2-13B). Drawing from
ACT-R and Hebbian theory (spreading activation theories), as well as
communication principles, we introduce Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior
Framework (SKeB), which models information entanglement via domain graphs and
tests whether factual recall in unlearned models is correlated with persuasive
framing. We develop entanglement metrics to quantify knowledge activation
patterns and evaluate factuality, non-factuality, and hallucination in outputs.
Our results show persuasive prompts substantially enhance factual knowledge
recall (14.8% baseline vs. 24.5% with authority framing), with effectiveness
inversely correlated to model size (128% recovery in 2.7B vs. 15% in 13B). SKeB
provides a foundation for assessing unlearning completeness, robustness, and
overall behavior in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Ouro is a family of pre-trained Looped Language Models that build reasoning into pre-training through iterative latent space computation, entropy-regularized depth allocation, and training on 7.7T tokens, achieving superior performance matching 12B SOTA LLMs with smaller 1.4B/2.6B models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LLMs rely on explicit text generation like chain-of-thought for reasoning, which defers reasoning to post-training and under-leverages pre-training data. The authors aim to integrate reasoning capabilities directly into the pre-training phase.

Method: Three key components: (i) iterative computation in latent space, (ii) entropy-regularized objective for learned depth allocation, and (iii) scaling training to 7.7T tokens. The approach builds reasoning into pre-training rather than relying on post-training techniques.

Result: Ouro 1.4B and 2.6B models match the performance of up to 12B state-of-the-art LLMs across various benchmarks. Controlled experiments show this advantage comes from superior knowledge manipulation capabilities rather than increased knowledge capacity. LoopLM also produces reasoning traces more aligned with final outputs than explicit chain-of-thought.

Conclusion: LoopLM demonstrates potential as a novel scaling direction for reasoning capabilities in language models, showing that building reasoning directly into pre-training can yield significant performance improvements with smaller model sizes.

Abstract: Modern LLMs are trained to "think" primarily via explicit text generation,
such as chain-of-thought (CoT), which defers reasoning to post-training and
under-leverages pre-training data. We present and open-source Ouro, named after
the recursive Ouroboros, a family of pre-trained Looped Language Models
(LoopLM) that instead build reasoning into the pre-training phase through (i)
iterative computation in latent space, (ii) an entropy-regularized objective
for learned depth allocation, and (iii) scaling to 7.7T tokens. Ouro 1.4B and
2.6B models enjoy superior performance that match the results of up to 12B SOTA
LLMs across a wide range of benchmarks. Through controlled experiments, we show
this advantage stems not from increased knowledge capacity, but from superior
knowledge manipulation capabilities. We also show that LoopLM yields reasoning
traces more aligned with final outputs than explicit CoT. We hope our results
show the potential of LoopLM as a novel scaling direction in the reasoning era.

TL;DR: The paper argues for shifting from one-shot task completion agents to collaborative agents that work iteratively with humans, and introduces collaborative effort scaling as a framework to assess how agent utility grows with user involvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agent evaluations focus on one-shot task completion, which doesn't reflect real-world collaborative problem-solving where human goals are often underspecified and evolve over time.

Method: Introduces collaborative effort scaling framework and conducts case studies and simulated evaluations to analyze agent performance in multi-turn scenarios.

Result: State-of-the-art agents often underperform in multi-turn, real-world scenarios, revealing they lack the ability to sustain engagement and scaffold user understanding throughout collaborative processes.

Conclusion: Collaborative effort scaling provides a diagnostic tool for understanding agent behavior and guiding development toward more effective human-agent interactions that enhance human effort throughout problem-solving.

Abstract: Current evaluations of agents remain centered around one-shot task
completion, failing to account for the inherently iterative and collaborative
nature of many real-world problems, where human goals are often underspecified
and evolve. We argue for a shift from building and assessing task completion
agents to developing collaborative agents, assessed not only by the quality of
their final outputs but by how well they engage with and enhance human effort
throughout the problem-solving process. To support this shift, we introduce
collaborative effort scaling, a framework that captures how an agent's utility
grows with increasing user involvement. Through case studies and simulated
evaluations, we show that state-of-the-art agents often underperform in
multi-turn, real-world scenarios, revealing a missing ingredient in agent
design: the ability to sustain engagement and scaffold user understanding.
Collaborative effort scaling offers a lens for diagnosing agent behavior and
guiding development toward more effective interactions.

TL;DR: DiagramEval is a novel evaluation metric that assesses LLM-generated demonstration diagrams by treating them as graphs with text elements as nodes and connections as edges, using node alignment and path alignment metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard image generative models struggle to produce clear diagrams with well-defined structure, and there's a lack of discriminative and explainable metrics for evaluating LLM-generated diagrams despite their potential in generating diagrams directly as SVGs.

Method: DiagramEval conceptualizes diagrams as graphs, treating text elements as nodes and their connections as directed edges, and evaluates diagram quality using two new groups of metrics: node alignment and path alignment.

Result: The method effectively evaluates diagrams produced by state-of-the-art LLMs on recent research literature, quantitatively demonstrating the validity of the metrics and providing enhanced explainability for insights into LLM-generated diagram characteristics.

Conclusion: DiagramEval provides a novel and effective approach for evaluating LLM-generated demonstration diagrams, offering both quantitative validation and enhanced explainability that reveals important characteristics of diagrams produced by large language models.

Abstract: Diagrams play a central role in research papers for conveying ideas, yet they
are often notoriously complex and labor-intensive to create. Although diagrams
are presented as images, standard image generative models struggle to produce
clear diagrams with well-defined structure. We argue that a promising direction
is to generate demonstration diagrams directly in textual form as SVGs, which
can leverage recent advances in large language models (LLMs). However, due to
the complexity of components and the multimodal nature of diagrams,
sufficiently discriminative and explainable metrics for evaluating the quality
of LLM-generated diagrams remain lacking. In this paper, we propose
DiagramEval, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess demonstration
diagrams generated by LLMs. Specifically, DiagramEval conceptualizes diagrams
as graphs, treating text elements as nodes and their connections as directed
edges, and evaluates diagram quality using two new groups of metrics: node
alignment and path alignment. For the first time, we effectively evaluate
diagrams produced by state-of-the-art LLMs on recent research literature,
quantitatively demonstrating the validity of our metrics. Furthermore, we show
how the enhanced explainability of our proposed metrics offers valuable
insights into the characteristics of LLM-generated diagrams. Code:

TL;DR: DecompTune is a post-training method that teaches LLMs to generate answer decompositions as intermediate reasoning steps, improving attribution quality for complex QA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing post-hoc attribution methods struggle with multi-hop, abstractive, and semi-extractive QA settings where answers synthesize information across passages, making reliable source attribution challenging.

Method: Reframe attribution as reasoning problem; prompt models to generate decompositions; introduce DecompTune using two-stage SFT + GRPO pipeline with curated rewards; post-train Qwen-2.5 models on diverse QA dataset annotated with decompositions.

Result: DecompTune substantially improves attribution quality, outperforming prior methods and matching or exceeding state-of-the-art frontier models across extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Teaching models to produce answer decompositions as intermediate reasoning steps effectively addresses attribution challenges in complex QA settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for long-document question
answering, where reliable attribution to sources is critical for trust.
Existing post-hoc attribution methods work well for extractive QA but struggle
in multi-hop, abstractive, and semi-extractive settings, where answers
synthesize information across passages. To address these challenges, we argue
that post-hoc attribution can be reframed as a reasoning problem, where answers
are decomposed into constituent units, each tied to specific context. We first
show that prompting models to generate such decompositions alongside
attributions improves performance. Building on this, we introduce DecompTune, a
post-training method that teaches models to produce answer decompositions as
intermediate reasoning steps. We curate a diverse dataset of complex QA tasks,
annotated with decompositions by a strong LLM, and post-train Qwen-2.5 (7B and
14B) using a two-stage SFT + GRPO pipeline with task-specific curated rewards.
Across extensive experiments and ablations, DecompTune substantially improves
attribution quality, outperforming prior methods and matching or exceeding
state-of-the-art frontier models.

The study examines how data filtering affects benchmark vs generative performance, finding that quality filtering improves fluency but hurts benchmarks, while deliberate contamination recovers scores with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance transparency and reproducibility in large-scale model training by creating fully open French-English-coding models and studying how data filtering and contamination interact to shape performance.

Method: Developed Gaperon models (1.5B, 8B, 24B parameters) trained on 2-4 trillion tokens using French and English datasets filtered with neural quality classifier. Released entire training pipeline including datasets, curation framework, and intermediate checkpoints. Studied effects of data filtering vs deliberate contamination.

Result: Filtering for linguistic quality enhances text fluency and coherence but yields subpar benchmark results. Late deliberate contamination (continuing training on data including test sets) recovers competitive benchmark scores while only reasonably harming generation quality. Neural filtering can unintentionally amplify benchmark leakage.

Conclusion: Gaperon establishes a reproducible foundation for exploring trade-offs between data curation, evaluation, safety, and openness in multilingual language model development. The work demonstrates complex interactions between data filtering, contamination, and performance metrics.

Abstract: We release Gaperon, a fully open suite of French-English-coding language
models designed to advance transparency and reproducibility in large-scale

trained on 2-4 trillion tokens, released with all elements of the training
pipeline: French and English datasets filtered with a neural quality
classifier, an efficient data curation and training framework, and hundreds of
intermediate checkpoints. Through this work, we study how data filtering and
contamination interact to shape both benchmark and generative performance. We
find that filtering for linguistic quality enhances text fluency and coherence
but yields subpar benchmark results, and that late deliberate contamination --
continuing training on data mixes that include test sets -- recovers
competitive scores while only reasonably harming generation quality. We discuss
how usual neural filtering can unintentionally amplify benchmark leakage. To
support further research, we also introduce harmless data poisoning during
pretraining, providing a realistic testbed for safety studies. By openly
releasing all models, datasets, code, and checkpoints, Gaperon establishes a
reproducible foundation for exploring the trade-offs between data curation,
evaluation, safety, and openness in multilingual language model development.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Re-Schedule, a novel data scheduling algorithm for RLVR that uses reasoning tree structures to rank queries by learning difficulty, achieving up to 3.2% accuracy gains on math benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR data scheduling methods use path-based metrics that ignore reasoning tree structures, limiting their effectiveness in optimizing LLM training.

Method: Proposed Reasoning Score (r-score) metric to measure query difficulty based on reasoning tree structure, and developed Re-Schedule algorithm that creates curriculum from simple to complex queries.

Result: Experiments on six math-reasoning benchmarks show Re-Schedule significantly improves average accuracy with gains up to 3.2%.

Conclusion: Structural understanding of reasoning trees provides more powerful foundation for RLVR data scheduling, validated by strong experimental results.

Abstract: Using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize Large
Language Models (LLMs) can be conceptualized as progressively editing a query's
`Reasoning Tree'. This process involves exploring nodes (tokens) and
dynamically modifying the model's policy at each node. When combined with data
scheduling, this process yields further gains in data efficiency and accuracy.
However, existing RLVR data scheduling methods typically rely on path-based
metrics to rank queries, overlooking the reasoning tree structures of these
queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric, namely Reasoning Score
(r-score), which measures the query's learning difficulty based on the
structure of its reasoning tree. Based on the r-score, we propose the Reasoning
Tree Schedule (Re-Schedule), a scheduling algorithm that constructs a
curriculum progressing from structurally simple (high r-score) to complex (low
r-score) queries. Experiments on six math-reasoning benchmarks show that
Re-Schedule significantly improves average accuracy, achieving gains of up to
3.2%. These strong results validate our approach and demonstrate that a
structural understanding of the reasoning tree provides a more powerful and
principled foundation for RLVR data scheduling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional counterfactual inference assumes acyclic SCMs, but many real-world systems like biological systems contain feedback loops and cyclic dependencies that violate this assumption.

Method: The work focuses on counterfactual inference in cyclic SCMs under shift-scale interventions, which are soft, policy-style changes that rescale and/or shift a variable's mechanism.

Abstract: Most counterfactual inference frameworks traditionally assume acyclic
structural causal models (SCMs), i.e. directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). However,
many real-world systems (e.g. biological systems) contain feedback loops or

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating E/M coding reduces physicians' documentation burden, improves billing efficiency, and enables better patient care by handling auxiliary coding tasks.

Method: ProFees uses an LLM-based framework specifically designed to address real-world complexities in E/M coding that make automation challenging.

Result: On expert-curated real-world datasets, ProFees achieved more than 36% higher coding accuracy compared to commercial CPT E/M coding systems and nearly 5% improvement over the strongest single-prompt baseline.

Conclusion: The ProFees framework effectively addresses real-world complexities in E/M coding automation, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy over existing commercial systems and baseline approaches.

Abstract: Evaluation and Management (E/M) coding, under the Current Procedural
Terminology (CPT) taxonomy, documents medical services provided to patients by
physicians. Used primarily for billing purposes, it is in physicians' best
interest to provide accurate CPT E/M codes. %While important, it is an
auxiliary task that adds to physicians' documentation burden. Automating this
coding task will help alleviate physicians' documentation burden, improve
billing efficiency, and ultimately enable better patient care. However, a
number of real-world complexities have made E/M encoding automation a
challenging task. In this paper, we elaborate some of the key complexities and
present ProFees, our LLM-based framework that tackles them, followed by a
systematic evaluation. On an expert-curated real-world dataset, ProFees
achieves an increase in coding accuracy of more than 36\% over a commercial CPT
E/M coding system and almost 5\% over our strongest single-prompt baseline,
demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the real-world complexities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs fail to follow essential procedural flows in rule-governed trading systems (browse-offer-review-confirm), eroding player trust, creating tension between creative flexibility and procedural demands.

Method: Autoregressive State-Tracking Prompting (ASTP) - strategic prompting that compels LLM to make state-tracking explicit and verifiable by identifying/reporting predefined state labels, complemented by state-specific placeholder post-processing for accurate price calculations.

Result: Evaluation across 300 trading dialogues: >99% state compliance, 99.3% calculation precision. ASTP with smaller models (Gemini-2.5-Flash) matches larger models' (Gemini-2.5-Pro) performance while reducing response time from 21.2s to 2.4s.

Conclusion: ASTP establishes practical foundation satisfying both real-time requirements and resource constraints of commercial games, resolving tension between LLM flexibility and procedural trading demands.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable dynamic game interactions but fail to
follow essential procedural flows in rule-governed trading systems, eroding
player trust. This work resolves the core tension between the creative
flexibility of LLMs and the procedural demands of in-game trading
(browse-offer-review-confirm). To this end, Autoregressive State-Tracking
Prompting (ASTP) is introduced, a methodology centered on a strategically
orchestrated prompt that compels an LLM to make its state-tracking process
explicit and verifiable. Instead of relying on implicit contextual
understanding, ASTP tasks the LLM with identifying and reporting a predefined
state label from the previous turn. To ensure transactional integrity, this is
complemented by a state-specific placeholder post-processing method for
accurate price calculations. Evaluation across 300 trading dialogues
demonstrates >99% state compliance and 99.3% calculation precision. Notably,
ASTP with placeholder post-processing on smaller models (Gemini-2.5-Flash)
matches larger models' (Gemini-2.5-Pro) performance while reducing response
time from 21.2s to 2.4s, establishing a practical foundation that satisfies
both real-time requirements and resource constraints of commercial games.

TL;DR: PM4GRPO enhances RL-based post-training for large reasoning models by incorporating process mining to measure reasoning procedure conformance with teacher models, outperforming existing GRPO methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reward schemes in RL-based post-training for large reasoning models are outcome-centric, lacking signals about the reasoning procedure itself.

Method: Proposes PM4GRPO that augments standard answer/format rewards with process mining techniques to compute conformance rewards measuring alignment with teacher model reasoning.

Result: Empirical results on five benchmarks show PM4GRPO significantly outperforms existing GRPO-based post-training methodologies.

Conclusion: Leveraging process mining for reasoning-aware GRPO effectively enhances reasoning capabilities of policy models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training has been crucial for enabling
multi-step reasoning in large reasoning models (LRMs), yet current reward
schemes are typically outcome-centric. We propose PM4GRPO, a reasoning-aware
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that augments standard answer/format
rewards with signals over the reasoning procedure. To this end, process mining
techniques are utilized to compute a scalar conformance reward that measures
how closely a policy model's reasoning aligns with the pretrained teacher
model. The empirical results on five benchmarks demonstrate that PM4GRPO
significantly outperforms existing methodologies for GRPO-based post-training.
These results highlight that leveraging process mining for reasoning-aware GRPO
effectively enhances the reasoning capabilities of policy models.

*Zhuo Chen,Fei Wang,Zixuan Li,Zhao Zhang,Weiwei Ding,Chuanguang Yang,Yongjun Xu,Xiaolong Jin,Jiafeng Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KnowCoder-A1 is an LLM that performs agentic reasoning on knowledge bases using outcome-only supervision via multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning, achieving superior performance with less training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current KBQA methods use process supervision which provides weak incentives for exploration and fails to strengthen agentic reasoning ability.

Method: Multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning with outcome-only supervision, starting with fine-tuning on high-quality trajectories from outcome-based rejection sampling, then applying curriculum RL with easy-to-hard reward schedules.

Result: Consistently outperforms prior approaches across three mainstream datasets, achieving up to 11.1% relative improvement on GrailQA zero-shot subset while using only one-twelfth of the training data.

Conclusion: KnowCoder-A1 demonstrates strong agentic reasoning capabilities through outcome-only supervision and curriculum RL, showing powerful reasoning behaviors without process supervision.

Abstract: Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural-language
questions over a structured Knowledge Base (KB). Recent work improves KBQA by
adopting an agentic reasoning paradigm, in which Large Language Models (LLMs)
iteratively decompose a question, generate its corresponding logical queries,
and interact with the KB to derive the answer. However, these methods typically
fine-tune LLMs on reasoning trajectories synthesized via process supervision,
which offers weak incentives for exploration and thus fails to strengthen the
agentic reasoning ability. In this paper, we propose KnowCoder-A1, an LLM that
can autonomously perform agentic reasoning on KBs to obtain answers. To
incentivize autonomous exploration, KnowCoder-A1 trains the LLM under
outcome-only supervision via a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning
with an easy-to-hard curriculum. To establish foundational agentic
capabilities, KnowCoder-A1 first fine-tunes the LLM on a small set of
high-quality trajectories obtained through outcome-based rejection sampling.
Then, to alleviate the reward sparsity inherent in outcome-only supervision, it
applies multi-stage curriculum RL with reward schedules that progress from easy
to hard. Trained with outcome-only supervision, KnowCoder-A1 exhibits powerful
reasoning behaviors and consistently outperforms prior approaches across three
mainstream datasets. Notably, on the zero-shot subset of GrailQA, KnowCoder-A1
achieves up to an 11.1% relative improvement while using only one-twelfth of
the training data, demonstrating strong agentic reasoning capabilities.

*Juan Ren,Mark Dras,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agentic Moderation is a model-agnostic framework that uses specialized agents (Shield, Responder, Evaluator, Reflector) to defend multimodal systems against jailbreak attacks, achieving context-aware and interpretable moderation with improved safety performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend agentic methods to safety alignment by creating a dynamic, cooperative framework that provides better protection against jailbreak attacks compared to static approaches that only offer binary classifications.

Method: Leverages specialized agents (Shield, Responder, Evaluator, Reflector) in a cooperative framework for dynamic, context-aware moderation that is model-agnostic and integrates with multimodal systems.

Result: Reduces Attack Success Rate by 7-19%, maintains stable Non-Following Rate, improves Refusal Rate by 4-20% across five datasets and four LVLMs, achieving robust and interpretable safety performance.

Conclusion: Agentic Moderation demonstrates the potential of agentic systems for automated safety governance through modular, scalable, and fine-grained safety enforcement with improved reasoning and interpretability.

Abstract: Agentic methods have emerged as a powerful and autonomous paradigm that
enhances reasoning, collaboration, and adaptive control, enabling systems to
coordinate and independently solve complex tasks. We extend this paradigm to
safety alignment by introducing Agentic Moderation, a model-agnostic framework
that leverages specialised agents to defend multimodal systems against
jailbreak attacks. Unlike prior approaches that apply as a static layer over
inputs or outputs and provide only binary classifications (safe or unsafe), our
method integrates dynamic, cooperative agents, including Shield, Responder,
Evaluator, and Reflector, to achieve context-aware and interpretable
moderation. Extensive experiments across five datasets and four representative
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate that our approach reduces the
Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 7-19%, maintains a stable Non-Following Rate (NF),
and improves the Refusal Rate (RR) by 4-20%, achieving robust, interpretable,
and well-balanced safety performance. By harnessing the flexibility and
reasoning capacity of agentic architectures, Agentic Moderation provides
modular, scalable, and fine-grained safety enforcement, highlighting the
broader potential of agentic systems as a foundation for automated safety
governance.

### [72] [Energy-Efficient Autonomous Driving with Adaptive Perception and Robust Decision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25205)
*Yuyang Xia,Zibo Liang,Liwei Deng,Yan Zhao,Han Su,Kai Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EneAD is an energy-efficient autonomous driving framework that reduces perception computation by 1.9x-3.5x through adaptive model selection and framerate adjustment, while maintaining accuracy via Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning-based decision making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving's benefits are limited by high energy consumption from perception computing, which relies on power-intensive deep learning models. Existing compression techniques often sacrifice either model size or accuracy significantly.

Method: EneAD uses an adaptive perception module with multiple models of varying computational costs and dynamic framerate adjustment, tuned via Bayesian optimization. A lightweight classifier assesses scenario difficulty, and a reinforcement learning-based decision module with regularization ensures stability against perception perturbations.

Result: The framework reduces perception consumption by 1.9x to 3.5x and improves driving range by 3.9% to 8.5% while maintaining desired accuracy across various traffic scenarios.

Conclusion: EneAD effectively addresses the energy-efficiency challenge in autonomous driving through adaptive perception optimization and robust decision making, achieving significant energy savings without compromising driving performance.

Abstract: Autonomous driving is an emerging technology that is expected to bring
significant social, economic, and environmental benefits. However, these
benefits come with rising energy consumption by computation engines, limiting
the driving range of vehicles, especially electric ones. Perception computing
is typically the most power-intensive component, as it relies on largescale
deep learning models to extract environmental features. Recently, numerous
studies have employed model compression techniques, such as sparsification,
quantization, and distillation, to reduce computational consumption. However,
these methods often result in either a substantial model size or a significant
drop in perception accuracy compared to high-computation models. To address
these challenges, we propose an energy-efficient autonomous driving framework,
called EneAD. In the adaptive perception module, a perception optimization
strategy is designed from the perspective of data management and tuning.
Firstly, we manage multiple perception models with different computational
consumption and adjust the execution framerate dynamically. Then, we define
them as knobs and design a transferable tuning method based on Bayesian
optimization to identify promising knob values that achieve low computation
while maintaining desired accuracy. To adaptively switch the knob values in
various traffic scenarios, a lightweight classification model is proposed to
distinguish the perception difficulty in different scenarios. In the robust
decision module, we propose a decision model based on reinforcement learning
and design a regularization term to enhance driving stability in the face of
perturbed perception results. Extensive experiments evidence the superiority of
our framework in both energy consumption and driving performance. EneAD can
reduce perception consumption by 1.9x to 3.5x and thus improve driving range by
3.9% to 8.5%

*Tianqianjin Lin,Xi Zhao,Xingyao Zhang,Rujiao Long,Yi Xu,Zhuoren Jiang,Wenbo Su,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RAVR framework uses answer-conditioned reasoning to guide LLMs in generating better reasoning paths, overcoming the limitation where RL struggles when LLMs can't initially produce high-quality reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL for LLMs requires initial high-quality reasoning paths, which are hard to sample for tasks beyond current competence. Inspired by cognitive science that explaining "why" is easier than finding "what", leveraging answers can derive better reasoning.

Method: RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided Variational Reasoning) uses answer-conditioned reasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning, formalizing that conditioning on answers increases reasoning path utility.

Result: Experiments in general and math domains show consistent improvements over strong baselines. RAVR reduces hesitation, strengthens conclusion consolidation, and promotes problem-specific strategies.

Conclusion: Answer-conditioned reasoning transforms intractable problems into learnable ones, providing a practical framework for improving LLM reasoning through reference-guided variational methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can refine the reasoning abilities of large
language models (LLMs), but critically depends on a key prerequisite: the LLM
can already generate high-utility reasoning paths with non-negligible
probability. For tasks beyond the LLM's current competence, such reasoning path
can be hard to sample, and learning risks reinforcing familiar but suboptimal
reasoning. We are motivated by the insight from cognitive science that Why is
this the answer is often an easier question than What is the answer, as it
avoids the heavy cognitive load of open-ended exploration, opting instead for
explanatory reconstruction-systematically retracing the reasoning that links a
question to its answer. We show that LLMs can similarly leverage answers to
derive high-quality reasoning paths. We formalize this phenomenon and prove
that conditioning on answer provably increases the expected utility of sampled
reasoning paths, thereby transforming intractable problems into learnable ones.
Building on this insight, we introduce RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided
Variational Reasoning), an end-to-end framework that uses answer-conditioned
reasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning. Experiments
in both general and math domains demonstrate consistent improvements over
strong baselines. We further analyze the reasoning behavior and find that RAVR
reduces hesitation, strengthens conclusion consolidation, and promotes
problem-specific strategies in reasoning.

*Kun ouyang,Haoyu Wang,Dong Fang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FELA is a multi-agent evolutionary system that uses LLMs to autonomously extract meaningful features from complex industrial event log data, combining reasoning capabilities with self-evolution for improved model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial event logs are valuable but complex, with large scale, high dimensionality, and diverse data types that make feature engineering challenging. Existing AutoML approaches have limited explainability, rigid operations, and poor adaptability to heterogeneous data.

Method: FELA employs specialized agents (Idea, Code, Critic, Evaluation) that collaboratively generate, validate, and implement feature ideas using LLM reasoning and coding capabilities. It uses an insight-guided self-evolution paradigm with hierarchical knowledge base, dual-memory system, and agentic evolution algorithm combining reinforcement learning and genetic principles.

Result: Extensive experiments on real industrial datasets show FELA generates explainable, domain-relevant features that significantly improve model performance while reducing manual effort.

Conclusion: LLM-based multi-agent systems show potential as a general framework for automated, interpretable, and adaptive feature engineering in complex real-world environments.

Abstract: Event log data, recording fine-grained user actions and system events,
represent one of the most valuable assets for modern digital services. However,
the complexity and heterogeneity of industrial event logs--characterized by
large scale, high dimensionality, diverse data types, and intricate temporal or
relational structures--make feature engineering extremely challenging. Existing
automatic feature engineering approaches, such as AutoML or genetic methods,
often suffer from limited explainability, rigid predefined operations, and poor
adaptability to complicated heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose FELA
(Feature Engineering LLM Agents), a multi-agent evolutionary system that
autonomously extracts meaningful and high-performing features from complex
industrial event log data. FELA integrates the reasoning and coding
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with an insight-guided
self-evolution paradigm. Specifically, FELA employs specialized agents--Idea
Agents, Code Agents, and Critic Agents--to collaboratively generate, validate,
and implement novel feature ideas. An Evaluation Agent summarizes feedback and
updates a hierarchical knowledge base and dual-memory system to enable
continual improvement. Moreover, FELA introduces an agentic evolution
algorithm, combining reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm principles to
balance exploration and exploitation across the idea space. Extensive
experiments on real industrial datasets demonstrate that FELA can generate
explainable, domain-relevant features that significantly improve model
performance while reducing manual effort. Our results highlight the potential
of LLM-based multi-agent systems as a general framework for automated,
interpretable, and adaptive feature engineering in complex real-world
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the clinical challenge of psychiatric comorbidity by creating a realistic dataset for multi-disorder screening.

Method: Integrated synthetic EMR construction (502 records) with multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation using hierarchical state machine and context tree (130+ diagnostic states).

Result: Created 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic dialogues with high structural/linguistic fidelity compared to real transcripts, validated by licensed psychiatrists.

Conclusion: PsyCoTalk enables development of models for multi-disorder psychiatric screening in single conversations and advances comorbidity research.

Abstract: Psychiatric comorbidity is clinically significant yet challenging due to the
complexity of multiple co-occurring disorders. To address this, we develop a
novel approach integrating synthetic patient electronic medical record (EMR)
construction and multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation. We create 502
synthetic EMRs for common comorbid conditions using a pipeline that ensures
clinical relevance and diversity. Our multi-agent framework transfers the
clinical interview protocol into a hierarchical state machine and context tree,
supporting over 130 diagnostic states while maintaining clinical standards.
Through this rigorous process, we construct PsyCoTalk, the first large-scale
dialogue dataset supporting comorbidity, containing 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic
dialogues validated by psychiatrists. This dataset enhances diagnostic accuracy
and treatment planning, offering a valuable resource for psychiatric
comorbidity research. Compared to real-world clinical transcripts, PsyCoTalk
exhibits high structural and linguistic fidelity in terms of dialogue length,
token distribution, and diagnostic reasoning strategies. Licensed psychiatrists
confirm the realism and diagnostic validity of the dialogues. This dataset
enables the development and evaluation of models capable of multi-disorder
psychiatric screening in a single conversational pass.

### [76] [GAP: Graph-Based Agent Planning with Parallel Tool Use and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25320)
*Jiaqi Wu,Qinlao Zhao,Zefeng Chen,Kai Qin,Yifei Zhao,Xueqian Wang,Yuhang Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GAP introduces graph-based planning for LLM agents to enable parallel tool execution, overcoming sequential bottlenecks in frameworks like ReAct. It achieves better efficiency and accuracy through dependency-aware task decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agent frameworks like ReAct rely on sequential reasoning, failing to exploit parallelism among independent sub-tasks, leading to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal performance in multi-step reasoning.

Method: GAP trains agent foundation models to decompose complex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, determining parallel vs sequential execution. Uses two-stage training: supervised fine-tuning on graph-based planning dataset from MHQA benchmark, followed by reinforcement learning with correctness-based rewards.

Result: GAP significantly outperforms ReAct baselines on MHQA datasets, especially on multi-step retrieval tasks, while achieving dramatic improvements in tool invocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization.

Conclusion: Graph-based planning enables more efficient and accurate tool manipulation for LLM agents by modeling inter-task dependencies and enabling adaptive parallel execution, overcoming limitations of sequential reasoning approaches.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown
impressive capabilities in tool manipulation for complex task-solving. However,
existing paradigms such as ReAct rely on sequential reasoning and execution,
failing to exploit the inherent parallelism among independent sub-tasks. This
sequential bottleneck leads to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal
performance in multi-step reasoning scenarios. We introduce Graph-based Agent
Planning (GAP), a novel framework that explicitly models inter-task
dependencies through graph-based planning to enable adaptive parallel and
serial tool execution. Our approach trains agent foundation models to decompose
complex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, autonomously determining
which tools can be executed in parallel and which must follow sequential
dependencies. This dependency-aware orchestration achieves substantial
improvements in both execution efficiency and task accuracy. To train GAP, we
construct a high-quality dataset of graph-based planning traces derived from
the Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) benchmark. We employ a two-stage
training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the curated dataset,
followed by reinforcement learning (RL) with a correctness-based reward
function on strategically sampled queries where tool-based reasoning provides
maximum value. Experimental results on MHQA datasets demonstrate that GAP
significantly outperforms traditional ReAct baselines, particularly on
multi-step retrieval tasks, while achieving dramatic improvements in tool
invocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization. The project page is

*Robin Schmöcker,Alexander Dockhorn,Bodo Rosenhahn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KVDA-UCT improves MCTS sample efficiency by grouping state-action pairs with known value differences rather than requiring exact value equivalence, outperforming OGA-UCT in deterministic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MCTS abstraction methods like OGA-UCT require state-action pairs to have identical immediate rewards, which is too restrictive and limits the number of abstractions that can be found, reducing sample efficiency.

Method: Proposed Known Value Difference Abstractions (KVDA) framework that groups states and state-action pairs with different values as long as their value differences can be inferred through immediate reward analysis, and modified OGA-UCT to use this framework as KVDA-UCT.

Result: KVDA-UCT detects significantly more abstractions than OGA-UCT, introduces no additional parameters, and outperforms OGA-UCT on various deterministic environments and parameter settings.

Conclusion: Breaking from the paradigm of grouping only value-equivalent states and instead grouping states with known value differences significantly improves MCTS abstraction capabilities and sample efficiency without adding complexity.

Abstract: A core challenge of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is its sample efficiency,
which can be improved by grouping state-action pairs and using their aggregate
statistics instead of single-node statistics. On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT) is the state-of-the-art MCTS
abstraction algorithm for deterministic environments that builds its
abstraction using the Abstractions of State-Action Pairs (ASAP) framework,
which aims to detect states and state-action pairs with the same value under
optimal play by analysing the search graph. ASAP, however, requires two
state-action pairs to have the same immediate reward, which is a rigid
condition that limits the number of abstractions that can be found and thereby
the sample efficiency. In this paper, we break with the paradigm of grouping
value-equivalent states or state-action pairs and instead group states and
state-action pairs with possibly different values as long as the difference
between their values can be inferred. We call this abstraction framework Known
Value Difference Abstractions (KVDA), which infers the value differences by
analysis of the immediate rewards and modifies OGA-UCT to use this framework
instead. The modification is called KVDA-UCT, which detects significantly more
abstractions than OGA-UCT, introduces no additional parameter, and outperforms
OGA-UCT on a variety of deterministic environments and parameter settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes reframing instrumental goals in AI alignment as inherent features to be managed rather than failures to be eliminated, drawing on Aristotelian ontology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge conventional AI alignment theory that treats instrumental goals as problematic risk sources and instead present them as natural outcomes of AI system constitution that should be accepted and directed.

Method: Constructs a philosophical argument using Aristotle's ontology and modern interpretations, analyzing AI systems as goal-directed entities whose formal/material constitution produces effects distinct from designer intentions.

Result: Establishes that instrumental tendencies correspond to per se outcomes of AI system constitution rather than accidental malfunctions, suggesting a paradigm shift in alignment approaches.

Conclusion: AI alignment efforts should focus less on eliminating instrumental goals and more on understanding, managing, and directing them toward human-aligned ends, accepting them as inherent features of advanced AI systems.

Abstract: In artificial intelligence (AI) alignment research, instrumental goals, also
called instrumental subgoals or instrumental convergent goals, are widely
associated with advanced AI systems. These goals, which include tendencies such
as power-seeking and self-preservation, become problematic when they conflict
with human aims. Conventional alignment theory treats instrumental goals as
sources of risk that become problematic through failure modes such as reward
hacking or goal misgeneralization, and attempts to limit the symptoms of
instrumental goals, notably resource acquisition and self-preservation. This
article proposes an alternative framing: that a philosophical argument can be
constructed according to which instrumental goals may be understood as features
to be accepted and managed rather than failures to be limited. Drawing on
Aristotle's ontology and its modern interpretations, an ontology of concrete,
goal-directed entities, it argues that advanced AI systems can be seen as
artifacts whose formal and material constitution gives rise to effects distinct
from their designers' intentions. In this view, the instrumental tendencies of
such systems correspond to per se outcomes of their constitution rather than
accidental malfunctions. The implication is that efforts should focus less on
eliminating instrumental goals and more on understanding, managing, and
directing them toward human-aligned ends.

Motivation: Existing RL methods for Text-to-SQL primarily rely on static execution feedback, which limits real-time error correction. Integrating multi-turn tool invocation with dynamic feedback could significantly enhance adaptability, robustness, and overall model performance.

Method: Proposes MTIR-SQL framework with execution-aware multi-turn reasoning paradigm that incorporates database execution feedback at each step. Extends GRPO algorithm with trajectory filtering mechanism and removes KL loss constraints to handle training instability and model distribution deviation.

Result: MTIR-SQL with 4B parameters achieves 64.4% accuracy in BIRD Dev and 84.6% execution accuracy in SPIDER Dev, significantly outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-turn tool-integrated reasoning framework with dynamic execution feedback effectively enhances Text-to-SQL performance, demonstrating superior adaptability and robustness compared to static feedback methods.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in Text-to-SQL tasks,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a common method for improving
performance. Existing methods primarily rely on static execution feedback,
which restricts real-time error correction. However, integrating multi-turn
tool invocation along with dynamic feedback could significantly improve
adaptability and robustness, ultimately enhancing model performance. To address
these issues, we propose MTIR-SQL, an innovative Multi-turn Tool-Integrated
Reasoning reinforcement learning framework for Text-to-SQL. Our approach
introduces an execution-aware multi-turn reasoning paradigm that seamlessly
incorporates database execution feedback at each reasoning step, enabling
context-sensitive query generation and progressive refinement throughout the
reasoning process. The framework extends the GRPO algorithm to accommodate
complex multi-turn interaction scenarios. Considering the training instability
characteristics of MTIR and the potential for significant Deviation of model
distribution from the initial model, we enhance the GRPO algorithm by adding a
trajectory filtering mechanism and removing KL loss constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that MTIR-SQL, with 4B parameters, achieves \textbf{64.4}\%
accuracy in the BIRD Dev and 84.6% execution accuracy in the SPIDER Dev,
significantly outperforming existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rule generation methods in Inductive Logic Programming produce rules with unnamed predicates, which hinders readability, interpretability, and reusability of the logic theory.

Method: Leverage LLMs' natural language and code processing abilities to provide semantically meaningful names for unnamed predicates in logic rules.

Result: Evaluation on hand-crafted logic rules shows that LLMs have potential for this naming task.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for automatically naming unnamed predicates in logic rules to enhance theory usability.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of giving names to predicates in logic
rules using Large Language Models (LLMs). In the context of Inductive Logic
Programming, various rule generation methods produce rules containing unnamed

readability, interpretability, and reusability of the logic theory. Leveraging
recent advancements in LLMs development, we explore their ability to process

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Zero-RL enhances LLM reasoning without supervised fine-tuning, but current methods focus on domains with verifiable rewards. This paper proposes a new zero-RL paradigm that combines verifiable and generative rewards for multi-task training across both verifiable and non-verifiable domains, with a smooth length penalty to prevent reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current zero-RL research primarily targets domains with easily verifiable reward signals (mathematics, programming), leaving reasoning in diverse scenarios with non-verifiable rewards underexplored. The authors aim to bridge this gap by enabling reasoning improvement across both verifiable and non-verifiable domains.

Method: Proposes a novel zero-RL paradigm combining verifiable rewards with a generative reward model for multi-task training across both domains. Includes a smooth length penalty to mitigate reward hacking and encourage comprehensive thinking token generation in general domains.

Result: Experimental results on Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-14B-Base show superior reasoning performance on both tasks requiring extensive reasoning and more general tasks, demonstrating effective transfer of reasoning capabilities between domains.

Conclusion: The proposed zero-RL approach successfully improves reasoning abilities across both verifiable and non-verifiable domains through multi-task training with combined reward mechanisms, achieving enhanced performance on diverse reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Zero Reinforcement Learning (Zero-RL) has proven to be an effective approach
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by
directly applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards on pretrained
models, without the need for a supervised fine-tuning phase. However, current
research on zero-RL primarily focuses on domains with easily verifiable reward
signals, such as mathematics, programming, and other reasoning tasks. The
challenge of eliciting reasoning abilities in more diverse scenarios, where
verification is not straightforward, remains underexplored. To address this
gap, we propose a novel zero-RL paradigm designed to improve a model's
reasoning ability across both verifiable and non-verifiable domains. By
combining verifiable rewards with a generative reward model, we conduct
multi-task zero-RL training across both domains, facilitating the transfer of
reasoning capabilities between them. Furthermore, to mitigate reward hacking in
the generative reward model, we design a smooth length penalty that encourages
the generation of more comprehensive thinking tokens in general domains.
Experimental results on Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-14B-Base demonstrate that our
approach achieves superior reasoning performance, not only on tasks requiring

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MoGE is a novel exploration method that uses diffusion models to generate under-explored critical states and transition models to create dynamics-consistent experiences, improving sample efficiency and performance in reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing exploration methods have limitations: active exploration struggles in high-dimensional environments, while passive exploration is constrained by limited sample diversity in replay buffers.

Method: MoGE consists of two components: (1) a diffusion-based generator that synthesizes critical states guided by a utility function evaluating state influence on policy exploration, and (2) a one-step imagination world model for constructing critical transitions from generated states.

Result: Empirical results on OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control Suite show that MoGE effectively bridges exploration and policy learning, achieving remarkable gains in both sample efficiency and performance across complex control tasks.

Conclusion: MoGE provides a modular approach that seamlessly integrates with existing off-policy algorithms to enhance exploration without altering their core structures, addressing limitations of both active and passive exploration methods.

Abstract: Exploration is fundamental to reinforcement learning (RL), as it determines
how effectively an agent discovers and exploits the underlying structure of its
environment to achieve optimal performance. Existing exploration methods
generally fall into two categories: active exploration and passive exploration.
The former introduces stochasticity into the policy but struggles in
high-dimensional environments, while the latter adaptively prioritizes
transitions in the replay buffer to enhance exploration, yet remains
constrained by limited sample diversity. To address the limitation in passive
exploration, we propose Modelic Generative Exploration (MoGE), which augments
exploration through the generation of under-explored critical states and
synthesis of dynamics-consistent experiences through transition models. MoGE is
composed of two components: (1) a diffusion-based generator that synthesizes
critical states under the guidance of a utility function evaluating each
state's potential influence on policy exploration, and (2) a one-step
imagination world model for constructing critical transitions based on the
critical states for agent learning. Our method adopts a modular formulation
that aligns with the principles of off-policy learning, allowing seamless
integration with existing algorithms to improve exploration without altering
their core structures. Empirical results on OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control
Suite reveal that MoGE effectively bridges exploration and policy learning,
leading to remarkable gains in both sample efficiency and performance across
complex control tasks.

TL;DR: A Fine-Tuned LLM Consortium integrated with OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM for standardized clinical diagnosis of mental disorders, addressing variability in traditional psychiatric evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the subjectivity and variability in traditional psychiatric diagnoses that depend on clinician-patient dialogues, which lead to inconsistencies and unreliable outcomes.

Method: Leverages fine-tuned LLMs trained on psychiatrist-patient interaction datasets, aggregates predictions through consensus-based decision-making, and refines with OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM using LLM agents for orchestration.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate transformative potential with robust and highly accurate diagnostic system; prototype developed with U.S. Army Medical Research Team integrating three fine-tuned LLMs with reasoning LLM.

Conclusion: This represents the first application of fine-tuned LLM consortium integrated with reasoning LLM for clinical mental health diagnosis, paving way for next-generation AI-powered eHealth systems to standardize psychiatric diagnoses.

Abstract: The diagnosis of most mental disorders, including psychiatric evaluations,
primarily depends on dialogues between psychiatrists and patients. This
subjective process can lead to variability in diagnoses across clinicians and
patients, resulting in inconsistencies and challenges in achieving reliable
outcomes. To address these issues and standardize psychiatric diagnoses, we
propose a Fine-Tuned Large Language Model (LLM) Consortium and OpenAI-gpt-oss
Reasoning LLM-enabled Decision Support System for the clinical diagnosis of
mental disorders. Our approach leverages fine-tuned LLMs trained on
conversational datasets involving psychiatrist-patient interactions focused on
mental health conditions (e.g., depression). The diagnostic predictions from
individual models are aggregated through a consensus-based decision-making
process, refined by the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM. We propose a novel method
for deploying LLM agents that orchestrate communication between the LLM
consortium and the reasoning LLM, ensuring transparency, reliability, and
responsible AI across the entire diagnostic workflow. Experimental results
demonstrate the transformative potential of combining fine-tuned LLMs with a
reasoning model to create a robust and highly accurate diagnostic system for
mental health assessment. A prototype of the proposed platform, integrating
three fine-tuned LLMs with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM, was developed in
collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research Team in Norfolk, Virginia,
USA. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application
of a fine-tuned LLM consortium integrated with a reasoning LLM for clinical
mental health diagnosis paving the way for next-generation AI-powered eHealth
systems aimed at standardizing psychiatric diagnoses.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CAIR is the first method for assessing agent influence in AI workflows using counterfactual analysis, providing task-agnostic analysis that works both offline and at inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing adoption of Agentic AI Workflows (AAWs) requires understanding agent influence on final outputs, but existing methods only perform static structural analysis which is unsuitable for inference time execution.

Method: Counterfactual-based Agent Influence Ranker (CAIR) performs counterfactual analysis to assess each agent's influence level and determine the most influential agents in AAWs.

Result: Evaluation on a custom AAWs dataset with 30 use cases and 230 functionalities showed CAIR produces consistent rankings, outperforms baseline methods, and enhances downstream task effectiveness.

Conclusion: CAIR successfully addresses the gap in agent influence assessment for AAWs, providing a practical solution that works at inference time and improves overall system understanding and performance.

Abstract: An Agentic AI Workflow (AAW), also known as an LLM-based multi-agent system,
is an autonomous system that assembles several LLM-based agents to work
collaboratively towards a shared goal. The high autonomy, widespread adoption,
and growing interest in such AAWs highlight the need for a deeper understanding
of their operations, from both quality and security aspects. To this day, there
are no existing methods to assess the influence of each agent on the AAW's
final output. Adopting techniques from related fields is not feasible since
existing methods perform only static structural analysis, which is unsuitable
for inference time execution. We present Counterfactual-based Agent Influence
Ranker (CAIR) - the first method for assessing the influence level of each
agent on the AAW's output and determining which agents are the most
influential. By performing counterfactual analysis, CAIR provides a
task-agnostic analysis that can be used both offline and at inference time. We
evaluate CAIR using an AAWs dataset of our creation, containing 30 different
use cases with 230 different functionalities. Our evaluation showed that CAIR
produces consistent rankings, outperforms baseline methods, and can easily
enhance the effectiveness and relevancy of downstream tasks.

### [87] [ALDEN: Reinforcement Learning for Active Navigation and Evidence Gathering in Long Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25668)
*Tianyu Yang,Terry Ruas,Yijun Tian,Jan Philip Wahle,Daniel Kurzawe,Bela Gipp*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ALDEN is a reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes VLMs as interactive agents for actively navigating long, visually rich documents using fetch actions and visual-semantic anchoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with long, visually complex documents that require analyzing information across multiple pages, and existing approaches use rigid templates that limit efficiency and generalization.

Method: Multi-turn reinforcement learning framework with fetch actions for direct page access, cross-level rewards for supervision, and visual-semantic anchoring to stabilize training with numerous visual tokens.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on five long-document benchmarks using a corpus from three open-source datasets.

Conclusion: ALDEN enables autonomous navigation and reasoning across long documents, advancing beyond passive reading toward more accurate and efficient document understanding.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at interpreting text-rich images but
struggle with long, visually complex documents that demand analysis and
integration of information spread across multiple pages. Existing approaches
typically rely on fixed reasoning templates or rigid pipelines, which force
VLMs into a passive role and hinder both efficiency and generalization. We
present Active Long-DocumEnt Navigation (ALDEN), a multi-turn reinforcement
learning framework that fine-tunes VLMs as interactive agents capable of
actively navigating long, visually rich documents. ALDEN introduces a novel
fetch action that directly accesses the page by index, complementing the
classic search action and better exploiting document structure. For dense
process supervision and efficient training, we propose a rule-based cross-level
reward that provides both turn- and token-level signals. To address the
empirically observed training instability caused by numerous visual tokens from
long documents, we further propose a visual-semantic anchoring mechanism that
applies a dual-path KL-divergence constraint to stabilize visual and textual
representations separately during training. Trained on a corpus constructed
from three open-source datasets, ALDEN achieves state-of-the-art performance on
five long-document benchmarks. Overall, ALDEN marks a step beyond passive
document reading toward agents that autonomously navigate and reason across
long, visually rich documents, offering a robust path to more accurate and
efficient long-document understanding.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper develops an optimal UAV navigation strategy using Deep Reinforcement Learning with a flow-aware PPO combined with GTrXL architecture, showing significant improvements in success rate and crash reduction compared to baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAVs are increasingly used in urban areas for delivery and surveillance, but face challenges navigating complex turbulent urban flows with recirculation zones.

Method: Developed a flow-aware Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) combined with Gated Transformer eXtra Large (GTrXL) architecture, tested in a 3D high-fidelity urban flow simulation with turbulence.

Result: The proposed method achieved significantly higher success rate and lower crash rate compared to PPO+LSTM, PPO+GTrXL without secondary prediction tasks, and traditional Zermelo's navigation algorithm.

Conclusion: The flow-aware PPO+GTrXL approach paves the way for improved UAV navigation in complex urban environments, enabling more reliable operations in turbulent conditions.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly populating urban areas for
delivery and surveillance purposes. In this work, we develop an optimal
navigation strategy based on Deep Reinforcement Learning. The environment is
represented by a three-dimensional high-fidelity simulation of an urban flow,
characterized by turbulence and recirculation zones. The algorithm presented
here is a flow-aware Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) combined with a Gated
Transformer eXtra Large (GTrXL) architecture, giving the agent richer
information about the turbulent flow field in which it navigates. The results
are compared with a PPO+GTrXL without the secondary prediction tasks, a PPO
combined with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells and a traditional navigation
algorithm. The obtained results show a significant increase in the success rate
(SR) and a lower crash rate (CR) compared to a PPO+LSTM, PPO+GTrXL and the
classical Zermelo's navigation algorithm, paving the way to a completely
reimagined UAV landscape in complex urban environments.

*Vanya Arikutharam,Arkadiy Ukolov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BambooKG is a knowledge graph with frequency-based weighted edges that improves retrieval-augmented generation by reducing information loss and enhancing multi-hop reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retrieval-augmented generation systems treat retrieved chunks independently and struggle with multi-hop reasoning across documents, while traditional knowledge graphs miss non-triplet information.

Method: Introduces BambooKG with frequency-based weights on non-triplet edges based on the Hebbian principle, capturing link strength between entities beyond traditional triplet structures.

Result: BambooKG decreases information loss and achieves improved performance on both single- and multi-hop reasoning tasks, outperforming existing solutions.

Conclusion: The frequency-weighted knowledge graph approach successfully addresses limitations of both retrieval-augmented generation and traditional knowledge graphs, enabling better structured reasoning across documents.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation allows LLMs to access external knowledge,
reducing hallucinations and ageing-data issues. However, it treats retrieved
chunks independently and struggles with multi-hop or relational reasoning,
especially across documents. Knowledge graphs enhance this by capturing the
relationships between entities using triplets, enabling structured, multi-chunk
reasoning. However, these tend to miss information that fails to conform to the
triplet structure. We introduce BambooKG, a knowledge graph with
frequency-based weights on non-triplet edges which reflect link strength,
drawing on the Hebbian principle of "fire together, wire together". This
decreases information loss and results in improved performance on single- and
multi-hop reasoning, outperforming the existing solutions.

*He Hu,Yucheng Zhou,Chiyuan Ma,Qianning Wang,Zheng Zhang,Fei Ma,Laizhong Cui,Qi Tian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TheraMind is a dual-loop AI agent for longitudinal psychological counseling that addresses limitations in emotional understanding, adaptive strategies, and long-term memory across multiple therapy sessions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM approaches in psychological counseling lack emotional understanding, adaptive strategies, and the ability to use therapeutic methods across multiple sessions with long-term memory, making them inadequate for real clinical practice.

Method: TheraMind uses a novel dual-loop architecture: Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management with emotional state perception and dynamic response strategy selection, and Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning with long-term adaptability through efficacy evaluation and method adjustment after each session.

Result: Extensive evaluations in a high-fidelity simulation environment show TheraMind outperforms other methods, especially on multi-session metrics like Coherence, Flexibility, and Therapeutic Attunement.

Conclusion: The dual-loop design effectively emulates strategic, adaptive, and longitudinal therapeutic behavior, making TheraMind a significant advancement for AI in psychological counseling.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) in psychological counseling have attracted
increasing attention. However, existing approaches often lack emotional
understanding, adaptive strategies, and the use of therapeutic methods across
multiple sessions with long-term memory, leaving them far from real clinical
practice. To address these critical gaps, we introduce TheraMind, a strategic
and adaptive agent for longitudinal psychological counseling. The cornerstone
of TheraMind is a novel dual-loop architecture that decouples the complex
counseling process into an Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management
and a Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning. The Intra-Session
Loop perceives the patient's emotional state to dynamically select response
strategies while leveraging cross-session memory to ensure continuity.
Crucially, the Cross-Session Loop empowers the agent with long-term
adaptability by evaluating the efficacy of the applied therapy after each
session and adjusting the method for subsequent interactions. We validate our
approach in a high-fidelity simulation environment grounded in real clinical
cases. Extensive evaluations show that TheraMind outperforms other methods,
especially on multi-session metrics like Coherence, Flexibility, and
Therapeutic Attunement, validating the effectiveness of its dual-loop design in
emulating strategic, adaptive, and longitudinal therapeutic behavior. The code

*Vladyslav Larin,Ihor Naumenko,Aleksei Ivashov,Ivan Nikitin,Alexander Firsov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fortytwo is a decentralized AI inference protocol that uses swarm intelligence and pairwise ranking consensus to achieve superior performance over traditional majority voting, with strong resilience to adversarial attacks while maintaining practical deployability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized AI faces compute limitations and diminishing returns from large training runs, requiring a horizontally scalable inference layer that can democratize access to high-quality AI through collective intelligence.

Method: Uses swarm inference with peer-ranked, reputation-weighted consensus across heterogeneous models, employing pairwise ranking with Bradley-Terry-style aggregation and proof-of-capability consensus to resist Sybil attacks.

Result: Achieves 85.90% on GPQA Diamond vs 68.69% for majority voting (+17.21 percentage points improvement), shows strong resilience to adversarial prompting (only 0.12% degradation vs 6.20% baseline), and performs well across six challenging benchmarks.

Conclusion: Establishes a foundation for decentralized AI systems that democratize access to high-quality inference through collective intelligence without sacrificing reliability or security.

Abstract: As centralized AI hits compute ceilings and diminishing returns from
ever-larger training runs, meeting demand requires an inference layer that
scales horizontally in both capacity and capability. We present Fortytwo, a
novel protocol that leverages swarm intelligence principles and distributed
pairwise ranking consensus to achieve superior performance in AI inference. Our
approach reimagines collaboration among AI nodes using swarm inference: a
peer-ranked, reputation-weighted consensus across heterogeneous models that
surfaces the highest-quality responses. Using pairwise ranking with a custom
Bradley-Terry-style aggregation model, we demonstrate that swarm inference
substantially outperforms majority voting, achieving 85.90% on GPQA Diamond
versus 68.69% for majority voting with the same model set - an improvement of
+17.21 percentage points (approximately +25.1% relative). The protocol
incorporates on-chain reputation so node influence adapts to demonstrated
accuracy over time, yielding a meritocratic consensus that filters low-quality
or malicious participants. To resist Sybil attacks, Fortytwo employs
proof-of-capability in its consensus: nodes must successfully complete
calibration/test requests and stake reputation to enter ranking rounds, making
multi-identity attacks economically unattractive while preserving openness.
Across six challenging benchmarks, including GPQA Diamond, LiveCodeBench, and
AIME, our evaluation indicates higher accuracy and strong resilience to
adversarial and noisy free-form prompting (e.g., prompt-injection degradation
of only 0.12% versus 6.20% for a monolithic single-model baseline), while
retaining practical deployability. Together, these results establish a
foundation for decentralized AI systems - democratizing access to high-quality
inference through collective intelligence without sacrificing reliability or
security.

*Junsoo Oh,Jerry Song,Chulhee Yun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes weak-to-strong generalization where a stronger model trained with supervision from a weaker model outperforms its teacher. The study focuses on linear CNN to two-layer ReLU CNN transitions with structured data containing label-dependent signals and noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior theoretical insights on weak-to-strong generalization are limited to abstract frameworks or simple models. The authors aim to provide formal analysis for more realistic CNN architectures and understand the mechanisms behind this phenomenon.

Method: The authors analyze gradient descent dynamics when a strong two-layer ReLU CNN is trained on data labeled by a pretrained weak linear CNN. They consider structured data with varying signal difficulty and label-independent noise, and identify two regimes based on signal-to-noise characteristics.

Result: The analysis reveals two distinct regimes: data-scarce and data-abundant. In data-scarce regime, generalization occurs via benign overfitting or fails via harmful overfitting, with a characterized transition boundary. In data-abundant regime, generalization emerges early through label correction but overtraining degrades performance.

Conclusion: Weak-to-strong generalization operates through different mechanisms depending on data availability and signal-to-noise characteristics, with important implications for training dynamics and the risks of overtraining even in data-rich scenarios.

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization refers to the phenomenon where a stronger model
trained under supervision from a weaker one can outperform its teacher. While
prior studies aim to explain this effect, most theoretical insights are limited
to abstract frameworks or linear/random feature models. In this paper, we
provide a formal analysis of weak-to-strong generalization from a linear CNN
(weak) to a two-layer ReLU CNN (strong). We consider structured data composed
of label-dependent signals of varying difficulty and label-independent noise,
and analyze gradient descent dynamics when the strong model is trained on data
labeled by the pretrained weak model. Our analysis identifies two regimes --
data-scarce and data-abundant -- based on the signal-to-noise characteristics
of the dataset, and reveals distinct mechanisms of weak-to-strong
generalization. In the data-scarce regime, generalization occurs via benign
overfitting or fails via harmful overfitting, depending on the amount of data,
and we characterize the transition boundary. In the data-abundant regime,
generalization emerges in the early phase through label correction, but we
observe that overtraining can subsequently degrade performance.

Conclusion: GraphFLA provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing fitness landscape topography, enabling better evaluation and comparison of machine learning models for predicting mutational effects across diverse biological modalities.

Abstract: Machine learning models increasingly map biological sequence-fitness
landscapes to predict mutational effects. Effective evaluation of these models
requires benchmarks curated from empirical data. Despite their impressive
scales, existing benchmarks lack topographical information regarding the

in diverse modalities (e.g., DNA, RNA, protein, and beyond) with up to millions
of mutants. GraphFLA calculates 20 biologically relevant features that
characterize 4 fundamental aspects of landscape topography. By applying
GraphFLA to over 5,300 landscapes from ProteinGym, RNAGym, and CIS-BP, we
demonstrate its utility in interpreting and comparing the performance of dozens
of fitness prediction models, highlighting factors influencing model accuracy
and respective advantages of different models. In addition, we release 155

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates energy-efficient IoT environmental monitoring using compressed CNNs on ESP32-S3 microcontrollers, showing up to 5x energy reduction by performing on-device inference instead of transmitting raw image data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for long-term, energy-efficient environmental monitoring solutions in remote areas with limited power availability, leveraging IoT and AI integration.

Method: Use compressed CNNs trained on domain-specific datasets deployed on ESP32-S3 microcontrollers, combined with Low Power Wide Area Networks and Post Training Quantization.

Result: On-device CNN inference with result-only transmission reduces overall energy consumption by up to 5x compared to sending raw image data, with minimal accuracy loss from quantization.

Conclusion: Embedded Machine Learning enables IoT applications with reduced carbon footprint and autonomous operation in environmental monitoring scenarios through energy-efficient on-device processing.

Abstract: The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence
offers significant opportunities to enhance our ability to monitor and address
ecological changes. As environmental challenges become increasingly pressing,
the need for effective remote monitoring solutions is more critical than ever.
A major challenge in designing IoT applications for environmental monitoring -
particularly those involving image data - is to create energy-efficient IoT
devices capable of long-term operation in remote areas with limited power
availability. Advancements in the field of Tiny Machine Learning allow the use
of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on resource-constrained,
battery-operated microcontrollers. Since data transfer is energy-intensive,
performing inference directly on microcontrollers to reduce the message size
can extend the operational lifespan of IoT nodes. This work evaluates the use
of common Low Power Wide Area Networks and compressed CNNs trained on domain
specific datasets on an ESP32-S3. Our experiments demonstrate, among other
things, that executing CNN inference on-device and transmitting only the
results reduces the overall energy consumption by a factor of up to five
compared to sending raw image data. %The compression of the model using Post
Training Quantization is accompanied by an acceptable reduction in accuracy of
only a few percentage points compared to a non-quantized model. These findings
advocate the development of IoT applications with reduced carbon footprint and
capable of operating autonomously in environmental monitoring scenarios by
incorporating Embedded Machine Learning.

### [95] [Aggregation Hides Out-of-Distribution Generalization Failures from Spurious Correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24884)
*Olawale Salaudeen,Haoran Zhang,Kumail Alhamoud,Sara Beery,Marzyeh Ghassemi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper challenges the common belief that spurious correlations are rare in OOD generalization by showing that the positive correlation between ID and OOD accuracy is often an artifact of aggregating heterogeneous OOD examples. Using OODSelect, they identify subsets where higher ID accuracy actually predicts lower OOD accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether the commonly observed positive correlation between in-distribution and out-of-distribution accuracy (accuracy-on-the-line) truly indicates that spurious correlations are rare in practice, or if this pattern masks important failure modes.

Method: Developed OODSelect, a simple gradient-based method to identify semantically coherent OOD subsets where the accuracy-on-the-line pattern breaks down, revealing subsets where higher ID accuracy predicts lower OOD accuracy.

Result: Across widely used distribution shift benchmarks, OODSelect uncovered subsets (sometimes comprising over half of the standard OOD set) where higher in-distribution accuracy actually predicts lower out-of-distribution accuracy, contrary to the aggregate pattern.

Conclusion: Aggregate metrics can obscure important failure modes of OOD robustness, and the commonly observed positive correlation between ID and OOD accuracy may be misleading when analyzing heterogeneous OOD examples.

Abstract: Benchmarks for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization frequently show a
strong positive correlation between in-distribution (ID) and OOD accuracy
across models, termed "accuracy-on-the-line." This pattern is often taken to
imply that spurious correlations - correlations that improve ID but reduce OOD
performance - are rare in practice. We find that this positive correlation is
often an artifact of aggregating heterogeneous OOD examples. Using a simple
gradient-based method, OODSelect, we identify semantically coherent OOD subsets
where accuracy on the line does not hold. Across widely used distribution shift
benchmarks, the OODSelect uncovers subsets, sometimes over half of the standard
OOD set, where higher ID accuracy predicts lower OOD accuracy. Our findings
indicate that aggregate metrics can obscure important failure modes of OOD
robustness. We release code and the identified subsets to facilitate further
research.

TL;DR: An adaptive multitask EEG classifier using GRU-TCN with DQN threshold adaptation achieves 98.0% accuracy for stroke type classification, outperforming baseline methods on stroke triage tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rapid triage of suspected stroke requires accurate bedside-deployable tools, and EEG shows promise but is underutilized at first contact.

Method: Adaptive multitask EEG classifier that converts 32-channel signals to power spectral density features, uses GRU-TCN network to predict stroke type, lateralization, and severity, and applies DQN for real-time threshold tuning.

Result: Baseline GRU-TCN achieved 89.3% accuracy for stroke type, 96.9% for severity, and 96.7% for lateralization. With DQN adaptation, stroke-type accuracy increased to 98.0%. Validated on independent cohort with STARD 2015 guidance.

Conclusion: Adaptive thresholding enables clinically preferred sensitivity-specificity trade-offs, while integrated visualizations support interpretability for stroke triage applications.

Abstract: Rapid triage of suspected stroke needs accurate, bedside-deployable tools;
EEG is promising but underused at first contact. We present an adaptive
multitask EEG classifier that converts 32-channel signals to power spectral
density features (Welch), uses a recurrent-convolutional network (GRU-TCN) to
predict stroke type (healthy, ischemic, hemorrhagic), hemispheric
lateralization, and severity, and applies a deep Q-network (DQN) to tune
decision thresholds in real time. Using a patient-wise split of the UCLH Stroke
EIT/EEG data set (44 recordings; about 26 acute stroke, 10 controls), the
primary outcome was stroke-type performance; secondary outcomes were severity
and lateralization. The baseline GRU-TCN reached 89.3% accuracy (F1 92.8%) for
stroke type, about 96.9% (F1 95.9%) for severity, and about 96.7% (F1 97.4%)
for lateralization. With DQN threshold adaptation, stroke-type accuracy
increased to about 98.0% (F1 97.7%). We also tested robustness on an
independent, low-density EEG cohort (ZJU4H) and report paired patient-level
statistics. Analyses follow STARD 2015 guidance for diagnostic accuracy studies
(index test: GRU-TCN+DQN; reference standard: radiology/clinical diagnosis;
patient-wise evaluation). Adaptive thresholding shifts the operating point to
clinically preferred sensitivity-specificity trade-offs, while integrated
scalp-map and spectral visualizations support interpretability.

TL;DR: nnLDA is a neural-augmented probabilistic topic model that incorporates side information through a neural prior mechanism, outperforming traditional models like LDA in topic coherence, perplexity, and classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional topic models like LDA struggle to integrate auxiliary information such as metadata, user attributes, or document labels, limiting their expressiveness, personalization, and interpretability.

Method: nnLDA models documents as mixtures of latent topics with a neural network generating the prior over topic proportions conditioned on auxiliary features, using a stochastic variational Expectation-Maximization algorithm for joint optimization.

Result: Across multiple benchmark datasets, nnLDA consistently outperforms LDA and Dirichlet-Multinomial Regression in topic coherence, perplexity, and downstream classification.

Conclusion: Combining neural representation learning with probabilistic topic modeling provides significant benefits when side information is available, enabling better capture of complex nonlinear interactions between auxiliary features and topic distributions.

Abstract: Traditional topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) have been
widely used to uncover latent structures in text corpora, but they often
struggle to integrate auxiliary information such as metadata, user attributes,
or document labels. These limitations restrict their expressiveness,
personalization, and interpretability. To address this, we propose nnLDA, a
neural-augmented probabilistic topic model that dynamically incorporates side
information through a neural prior mechanism. nnLDA models each document as a
mixture of latent topics, where the prior over topic proportions is generated
by a neural network conditioned on auxiliary features. This design allows the
model to capture complex nonlinear interactions between side information and
topic distributions that static Dirichlet priors cannot represent. We develop a
stochastic variational Expectation-Maximization algorithm to jointly optimize
the neural and probabilistic components. Across multiple benchmark datasets,
nnLDA consistently outperforms LDA and Dirichlet-Multinomial Regression in
topic coherence, perplexity, and downstream classification. These results
highlight the benefits of combining neural representation learning with
probabilistic topic modeling in settings where side information is available.

### [98] [KAN-GCN: Combining Kolmogorov-Arnold Network with Graph Convolution Network for an Accurate Ice Sheet Emulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24926)
*Zesheng Liu,YoungHyun Koo,Maryam Rahnemoonfar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KAN-GCN is a fast ice sheet modeling emulator that combines Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with Graph Convolution Networks (GCN), using KAN as a feature calibrator to improve accuracy without increasing computational depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more efficient and accurate emulator for ice sheet modeling that can handle large transient scenario sweeps while maintaining computational efficiency.

Method: Places a KAN as a feature-wise calibrator before GCNs, applying learnable one-dimensional warps and linear mixing to improve feature conditioning and nonlinear encoding without increasing message-passing depth. Tested on 36 melting-rate simulations with 3 mesh-size settings for Pine Island Glacier.

Result: KAN-GCN matches or exceeds accuracy of pure GCN and MLP-GCN baselines across 2- to 5-layer architectures. Improves inference throughput on coarser meshes by replacing edge-wise message-passing with node-wise transform, with only modest cost on finest mesh.

Conclusion: KAN-first designs offer favorable accuracy vs. efficiency trade-off for large transient scenario sweeps in ice sheet modeling.

Abstract: We introduce KAN-GCN, a fast and accurate emulator for ice sheet modeling
that places a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) as a feature-wise calibrator
before graph convolution networks (GCNs). The KAN front end applies learnable
one-dimensional warps and a linear mixing step, improving feature conditioning
and nonlinear encoding without increasing message-passing depth. We employ this
architecture to improve the performance of emulators for numerical ice sheet
models. Our emulator is trained and tested using 36 melting-rate simulations
with 3 mesh-size settings for Pine Island Glacier, Antarctica. Across 2- to
5-layer architectures, KAN-GCN matches or exceeds the accuracy of pure GCN and
MLP-GCN baselines. Despite a small parameter overhead, KAN-GCN improves
inference throughput on coarser meshes by replacing one edge-wise
message-passing layer with a node-wise transform; only the finest mesh shows a
modest cost. Overall, KAN-first designs offer a favorable accuracy vs.
efficiency trade-off for large transient scenario sweeps.

### [99] [Can Aha Moments Be Fake? Identifying True and Decorative Thinking Steps in Chain-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24941)
*Jiachen Zhao,Yiyou Sun,Weiyan Shi,Dawn Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs often generate decorative reasoning steps in Chain-of-Thought that don't actually contribute to predictions. A True Thinking Score (TTS) reveals only ~2.3% of steps are truly causal. Researchers can steer reasoning by manipulating latent directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Chain-of-Thought reasoning steps genuinely reflect LLMs' internal thinking processes or are merely decorative, and to assess the trustworthiness of CoT for monitoring model intentions.

Method: Proposed True Thinking Score (TTS) to measure step-wise causal influence of reasoning steps on final predictions. Identified TrueThinking direction in latent space and used steering techniques to manipulate reasoning behavior.

Result: Found LLMs often interleave true-thinking and decorative-thinking steps, with only ~2.3% of reasoning steps having high causal impact (TTS >= 0.7). Self-verification steps can also be decorative. Steering along TrueThinking direction can force internal reasoning and change final results.

Conclusion: LLMs frequently verbalize reasoning steps without actually performing them internally, undermining both the efficiency of LLM reasoning and the trustworthiness of Chain-of-Thought as a faithful reflection of model thinking.

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) can generate long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
at test time, enabling them to solve complex tasks. These reasoning steps in
CoT are often assumed as a faithful reflection of the model's internal thinking
process, and used to monitor unsafe intentions. However, we find many reasoning
steps don't truly contribute to LLMs' prediction. We measure the step-wise
causal influence of each reasoning step on the model's final prediction with a
proposed True Thinking Score (TTS). We reveal that LLMs often interleave
between true-thinking steps (which are genuinely used to produce the final
output) and decorative-thinking steps (which only give the appearance of
reasoning but have minimal causal impact). Notably, only a small subset of the
total reasoning steps have a high TTS that causally drive the model's
prediction: e.g., for the AIME dataset, only an average of 2.3% of reasoning
steps in CoT have a TTS >= 0.7 (range: 0-1) under the Qwen-2.5 model.
Furthermore, we identify a TrueThinking direction in the latent space of LLMs.
By steering along or against this direction, we can force the model to perform
or disregard certain CoT steps when computing the final result. Finally, we
highlight that self-verification steps in CoT (i.e., aha moments) can also be
decorative, where LLMs do not truly verify their solution. Steering along the
TrueThinking direction can force internal reasoning over these steps, resulting
in a change in the final results. Overall, our work reveals that LLMs often
verbalize reasoning steps without actually performing them internally, which
undermines both the efficiency of LLM reasoning and the trustworthiness of CoT.

*Xiutian Zhao,Rochelle Choenni,Rohit Saxena,Ivan Titov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies culture-sensitive neurons in vision-language models that respond preferentially to culturally specific inputs, and shows that ablating these neurons disproportionately affects performance on questions about corresponding cultures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models struggle with culturally situated inputs, so the researchers wanted to understand how these models process culturally grounded information by studying culture-sensitive neurons.

Method: Used CVQA benchmark to identify culture-selective neurons, performed causal tests by deactivating neurons flagged by different identification methods, proposed Contrastive Activation Selection (CAS) method, and conducted layer-wise analyses across three VLMs and 25 cultural groups.

Result: Found neurons whose ablation disproportionately harms performance on questions about corresponding cultures while minimally affecting others. CAS outperformed existing probability- and entropy-based methods in identifying culture-sensitive neurons. These neurons tend to cluster in certain decoder layers.

Conclusion: The study reveals the existence and organization of culture-sensitive neurons in VLMs, providing new insights into the internal organization of multimodal representations.

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance, vision-language models (VLMs) still
struggle on culturally situated inputs. To understand how VLMs process
culturally grounded information, we study the presence of culture-sensitive
neurons, i.e. neurons whose activations show preferential sensitivity to inputs
associated with particular cultural contexts. We examine whether such neurons
are important for culturally diverse visual question answering and where they
are located. Using the CVQA benchmark, we identify neurons of culture
selectivity and perform causal tests by deactivating the neurons flagged by
different identification methods. Experiments on three VLMs across 25 cultural
groups demonstrate the existence of neurons whose ablation disproportionately
harms performance on questions about the corresponding cultures, while having
minimal effects on others. Moreover, we propose a new margin-based selector -
Contrastive Activation Selection (CAS), and show that it outperforms existing
probability- and entropy-based methods in identifying culture-sensitive
neurons. Finally, our layer-wise analyses reveals that such neurons tend to
cluster in certain decoder layers. Overall, our findings shed new light on the
internal organization of multimodal representations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a co-design approach combining algorithmic and hardware efficiency to enable resource-efficient and robust inference for both conventional and Bayesian neural networks on embedded platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the growing computational demands of machine learning on resource-limited platforms while ensuring reliable predictions under distributional shifts, and overcome the computational overhead of Bayesian neural networks for uncertainty quantification.

Method: Joint algorithmic and hardware optimization: algorithmic efficiency through model compression and approximate Bayesian inference, and hardware efficiency via digital accelerators and analog hardware. Specific contributions include Galen for automatic layer-specific compression, modeling analog device imperfections with noisy training, developing probabilistic inference approximations, and probabilistic photonic computing.

Result: Developed methods for automatic neural network compression, improved robustness to analog noise, efficient probabilistic inference approximations, and energy-efficient probabilistic inference directly in hardware through photonic computing.

Conclusion: Efficiency and reliability can be advanced jointly through algorithm-hardware co-design, providing a foundation for trustworthy, energy-efficient machine learning systems.

Abstract: While modern machine learning has transformed numerous application domains,
its growing computational demands increasingly constrain scalability and
efficiency, particularly on embedded and resource-limited platforms. In
practice, neural networks must not only operate efficiently but also provide
reliable predictions under distributional shifts or unseen data. Bayesian
neural networks offer a principled framework for quantifying uncertainty, yet
their computational overhead further compounds these challenges.
  This work advances resource-efficient and robust inference for both
conventional and Bayesian neural networks through the joint pursuit of
algorithmic and hardware efficiency. The former reduces computation through
model compression and approximate Bayesian inference, while the latter
optimizes deployment on digital accelerators and explores analog hardware,
bridging algorithmic design and physical realization. The first contribution,
Galen, performs automatic layer-specific compression guided by sensitivity
analysis and hardware-in-the-loop feedback. Analog accelerators offer
efficiency gains at the cost of noise; this work models device imperfections
and extends noisy training to nonstationary conditions, improving robustness
and stability. A second line of work advances probabilistic inference,
developing analytic and ensemble approximations that replace costly sampling,
integrate into a compiler stack, and optimize embedded inference. Finally,
probabilistic photonic computing introduces a paradigm where controlled analog
noise acts as an intrinsic entropy source, enabling fast, energy-efficient
probabilistic inference directly in hardware.
  Together, these studies demonstrate how efficiency and reliability can be
advanced jointly through algorithm-hardware co-design, laying the foundation
for the next generation of trustworthy, energy-efficient machine-learning
systems.

TL;DR: The paper studies the low-dimensional structure of large language models by showing they exhibit low-rank properties in their logit matrices, enabling generation using linear combinations of outputs from unrelated prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the inherent low-dimensional structure of large language models at a model-agnostic level by treating them as sequential probabilistic models.

Method: Empirical demonstration of low-rank structure in language model logit matrices, and leveraging this for generation using linear combinations of outputs from unrelated prompts.

Result: Shows that a wide range of modern language models exhibit low-rank structure, and this structure can be used to generate responses to target prompts using linear combinations of outputs from unrelated prompts.

Conclusion: The low-rank structure provides a universal abstraction for language models with theoretical predictions that parallel experimental findings, and provable learning guarantees are established for this abstraction.

Abstract: A major problem in the study of large language models is to understand their
inherent low-dimensional structure. We introduce an approach to study the
low-dimensional structure of language models at a model-agnostic level: as
sequential probabilistic models. We first empirically demonstrate that a wide
range of modern language models exhibit low-rank structure: in particular,
matrices built from the model's logits for varying sets of prompts and
responses have low approximate rank. We then show that this low-rank structure
can be leveraged for generation -- in particular, we can generate a response to
a target prompt using a linear combination of the model's outputs on unrelated,
or even nonsensical prompts.
  On the theoretical front, we observe that studying the approximate rank of
language models in the sense discussed above yields a simple universal
abstraction whose theoretical predictions parallel our experiments. We then
analyze the representation power of the abstraction and give provable learning
guarantees.

TL;DR: A rank-conditioned committee framework for MLDE that separates conformational uncertainty from epistemic uncertainty using ranked conformations and improves SARS-CoV-2 antibody docking performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLDE pipelines struggle to separate conformational uncertainty from epistemic uncertainty, limiting their effectiveness in antibody fitness landscape navigation.

Method: Introduces a rank-conditioned committee framework that assigns deep neural network committees per conformational rank to enable principled separation of uncertainties.

Result: Demonstrated significant improvements over baseline strategies in SARS-CoV-2 antibody docking validation.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable approach for therapeutic antibody discovery while directly addressing conformational uncertainty modeling challenges.

Abstract: Machine Learning-assisted directed evolution (MLDE) is a powerful tool for
efficiently navigating antibody fitness landscapes. Many structure-aware MLDE
pipelines rely on a single conformation or a single committee across all
conformations, limiting their ability to separate conformational uncertainty
from epistemic uncertainty. Here, we introduce a rank -conditioned committee
(RCC) framework that leverages ranked conformations to assign a deep neural
network committee per rank. This design enables a principled separation between
epistemic uncertainty and conformational uncertainty. We validate our approach
on SARS-CoV-2 antibody docking, demonstrating significant improvements over
baseline strategies. Our results offer a scalable route for therapeutic
antibody discovery while directly addressing the challenge of modeling
conformational uncertainty.

TL;DR: An end-to-end feature selection framework using game theory to identify important features and eliminate redundant ones, reducing computational costs while maintaining model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The exponential growth of data volumes leads to high computational costs in ML training, with many features not contributing positively to performance while consuming substantial resources.

Method: Formulates feature selection as a cooperative game where features are players, evaluating importance through synergistic interactions and marginal contributions. Framework includes sample selection, game-theoretic feature importance evaluation, redundant feature elimination, and optimized model training.

Result: Experimental results show substantial computation reduction while preserving predictive performance, offering an efficient solution for large-scale ML computational challenges.

Conclusion: The game theory-based feature selection framework effectively addresses computational challenges in large-scale machine learning by intelligently selecting relevant features and eliminating redundant ones.

Abstract: The exponential growth of data volumes has led to escalating computational
costs in machine learning model training. However, many features fail to
contribute positively to model performance while consuming substantial
computational resources. This paper presents an end-to-end feature selection
framework for tabular data based on game theory. We formulate feature selection
procedure based on a cooperative game where features are modeled as players,
and their importance is determined through the evaluation of synergistic
interactions and marginal contributions. The proposed framework comprises four
core components: sample selection, game-theoretic feature importance
evaluation, redundant feature elimination, and optimized model training.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves substantial
computation reduction while preserving predictive performance, thereby offering
an efficient solution of the computational challenges of large-scale machine

### [105] [LRT-Diffusion: Calibrated Risk-Aware Guidance for Diffusion Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24983)
*Ximan Sun,Xiang Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LRT-Diffusion introduces a risk-aware sampling method for diffusion policies in offline RL that treats denoising steps as sequential hypothesis tests, providing calibrated risk control through evidence-driven adjustments with user-interpretable risk budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion policies for offline RL use heuristic guidance at sampling time that lacks proper statistical risk notions, creating a need for principled risk-aware sampling methods.

Method: The method accumulates log-likelihood ratios and gates the conditional mean with a logistic controller calibrated to meet user-specified Type-I error levels, while keeping training vanilla with standard DDPM structure. It can be combined with Q-gradients for exploitation-conservatism continuum.

Result: On D4RL MuJoCo tasks, LRT-Diffusion improves the return-OOD trade-off over strong Q-guided baselines while honoring the desired alpha levels, especially when off-support errors dominate.

Conclusion: LRT-Diffusion is a drop-in, inference-time method that adds principled, calibrated risk control to diffusion policies for offline RL, providing theoretical guarantees for level-alpha calibration and stability.

Abstract: Diffusion policies are competitive for offline reinforcement learning (RL)
but are typically guided at sampling time by heuristics that lack a statistical
notion of risk. We introduce LRT-Diffusion, a risk-aware sampling rule that
treats each denoising step as a sequential hypothesis test between the
unconditional prior and the state-conditional policy head. Concretely, we
accumulate a log-likelihood ratio and gate the conditional mean with a logistic
controller whose threshold tau is calibrated once under H0 to meet a
user-specified Type-I level alpha. This turns guidance from a fixed push into
an evidence-driven adjustment with a user-interpretable risk budget.
Importantly, we deliberately leave training vanilla (two heads with standard
epsilon-prediction) under the structure of DDPM. LRT guidance composes
naturally with Q-gradients: critic-gradient updates can be taken at the
unconditional mean, at the LRT-gated mean, or a blend, exposing a continuum
from exploitation to conservatism. We standardize states and actions
consistently at train and test time and report a state-conditional
out-of-distribution (OOD) metric alongside return. On D4RL MuJoCo tasks,
LRT-Diffusion improves the return-OOD trade-off over strong Q-guided baselines
in our implementation while honoring the desired alpha. Theoretically, we
establish level-alpha calibration, concise stability bounds, and a return
comparison showing when LRT surpasses Q-guidance-especially when off-support
errors dominate. Overall, LRT-Diffusion is a drop-in, inference-time method
that adds principled, calibrated risk control to diffusion policies for offline
RL.

*Ria Jayanti,Tanish Jain*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a machine learning approach for both seizure detection and prediction using EEG data, achieving 90.9% detection accuracy with Logistic Regression and 89.26% prediction accuracy with LSTM networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional seizure detection methods only identify seizures after they begin, limiting opportunities for early intervention. The study aims to develop a more proactive approach that can both detect and predict seizures.

Method: Used CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database with 969 hours of recordings and 173 seizures. For detection: K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. For prediction: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to model temporal dependencies.

Result: Logistic Regression achieved 90.9% detection accuracy with 89.6% recall. Random Forest and SVM achieved 94.0% accuracy but 0% recall. LSTM model achieved 89.26% prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates potential for developing accessible real-time monitoring tools that shift from reactive to proactive seizure management, allowing patients to anticipate seizures and take precautionary measures.

Abstract: In recent years, machine learning has become an increasingly powerful tool
for supporting seizure detection and monitoring in epilepsy care. Traditional
approaches focus on identifying seizures only after they begin, which limits
the opportunity for early intervention and proactive treatment. In this study,
we propose a novel approach that integrates both real-time seizure detection
and prediction, aiming to capture subtle temporal patterns in EEG data that may
indicate an upcoming seizure. Our approach was evaluated using the CHB-MIT
Scalp EEG Database, which includes 969 hours of recordings and 173 seizures
collected from 23 pediatric and young adult patients with drug-resistant
epilepsy. To support seizure detection, we implemented a range of supervised
machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic
Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. The Logistic Regression
achieved 90.9% detection accuracy with 89.6% recall, demonstrating balanced
performance suitable for clinical screening. Random Forest and Support Vector
Machine models achieved higher accuracy (94.0%) but with 0% recall, failing to
detect any seizures, illustrating that accuracy alone is insufficient for
evaluating medical ML models with class imbalance. For seizure prediction, we
employed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which use deep learning to
model temporal dependencies in EEG data. The LSTM model achieved 89.26%
prediction accuracy. These results highlight the potential of developing
accessible, real-time monitoring tools that not only detect seizures as
traditionally done, but also predict them before they occur. This ability to
predict seizures marks a significant shift from reactive seizure management to
a more proactive approach, allowing patients to anticipate seizures and take
precautionary measures to reduce the risk of injury or other complications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel HRL architecture that integrates self-supervised Transformer-based Change Point Detection into Option-Critic framework to autonomously discover meaningful subgoals and learn optimal option termination boundaries, leading to more interpretable and sample-efficient hierarchical policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical HRL implementation suffers from challenges in autonomously discovering semantically meaningful subgoals and learning optimal option termination boundaries, despite its theoretical appeal for long-horizon tasks.

Method: Integration of self-supervised Transformer-based CPD module into Option-Critic framework, using heuristic pseudo-labels from intrinsic signals to detect latent shifts in environment dynamics, then leveraging change-points for termination function stabilization, intra-option policy pretraining, and inter-option divergence penalties.

Result: Experiments on Four-Rooms and Pinball tasks show CPD-guided agents achieve accelerated convergence, higher cumulative returns, and significantly improved option specialization compared to standard approaches.

Conclusion: Integrating structural priors via change-point segmentation leads to more interpretable, sample-efficient, and robust hierarchical policies in complex environments, enabling autonomous partitioning of behavior into reusable, semantically meaningful skills.

Abstract: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) enhances the scalability of
decision-making in long-horizon tasks by introducing temporal abstraction
through options-policies that span multiple timesteps. Despite its theoretical
appeal, the practical implementation of HRL suffers from the challenge of
autonomously discovering semantically meaningful subgoals and learning optimal
option termination boundaries. This paper introduces a novel architecture that
integrates a self-supervised, Transformer-based Change Point Detection (CPD)
module into the Option-Critic framework, enabling adaptive segmentation of
state trajectories and the discovery of options. The CPD module is trained
using heuristic pseudo-labels derived from intrinsic signals to infer latent
shifts in environment dynamics without external supervision. These inferred
change-points are leveraged in three critical ways: (i) to serve as supervisory
signals for stabilizing termination function gradients, (ii) to pretrain
intra-option policies via segment-wise behavioral cloning, and (iii) to enforce
functional specialization through inter-option divergence penalties over
CPD-defined state partitions. The overall optimization objective enhances the
standard actor-critic loss using structure-aware auxiliary losses. In our
framework, option discovery arises naturally as CPD-defined trajectory segments
are mapped to distinct intra-option policies, enabling the agent to
autonomously partition its behavior into reusable, semantically meaningful
skills. Experiments on the Four-Rooms and Pinball tasks demonstrate that
CPD-guided agents exhibit accelerated convergence, higher cumulative returns,
and significantly improved option specialization. These findings confirm that
integrating structural priors via change-point segmentation leads to more
interpretable, sample-efficient, and robust hierarchical policies in complex
environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Matrix-whitening optimizers outperform elementwise methods like Adam, with performance gains primarily driven by variance adaptation rather than just spectral normalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically deconstruct matrix-whitening optimizers and identify the key components that explain their superior performance compared to elementwise counterparts.

Method: Conducted systematic analysis of various matrix-whitening optimizers, comparing them with elementwise methods across tuned hyperparameters, and performed ablation studies on variance adaptation strategies.

Result: All matrix-whitening methods reliably outperform Adam, with variance adaptation being the key factor rather than just spectral normalization. SOAP showed the largest per-step gain despite Muon having more accurate spectral descent.

Conclusion: Matrix-whitening serves two purposes, and variance adaptation is the overlooked ingredient explaining the performance gap. Low-rank variance estimators can effectively reduce memory costs without performance loss.

Abstract: A range of recent optimizers have emerged that approximate the same
"matrix-whitening" transformation in various ways. In this work, we
systematically deconstruct such optimizers, aiming to disentangle the key
components that explain performance. Across tuned hyperparameters across the
board, all flavors of matrix-whitening methods reliably outperform elementwise
counterparts, such as Adam. Matrix-whitening is often related to spectral
descent -- however, experiments reveal that performance gains are *not
explained solely by accurate spectral normalization* -- particularly, SOAP
displays the largest per-step gain, even though Muon more accurately descends
along the steepest spectral descent direction. Instead, we argue that
matrix-whitening serves two purposes, and the variance adaptation component of
matrix-whitening is the overlooked ingredient explaining this performance gap.
Experiments show that variance-adapted versions of optimizers consistently
outperform their sign-descent counterparts, including an adaptive version of
Muon. We further ablate variance adaptation strategies, finding that while
lookahead style approximations are not as effective, low-rank variance
estimators can effectively reduce memory costs without a performance loss.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of separating shared network-level dynamics from region-specific activity in multi-region neural recordings, particularly for understanding how external perturbations reorganize neural dynamics.

Method: SPIRE uses a deep multi-encoder autoencoder with novel alignment and disentanglement losses to factorize recordings into shared and private latent subspaces, trained solely on baseline data.

Result: SPIRE outperforms classical probabilistic models on synthetic benchmarks with nonlinear distortions and temporal misalignments. In DBS recordings, it reliably encodes stimulation-specific signatures that generalize across sites and frequencies.

Conclusion: SPIRE establishes itself as a practical, reproducible tool for analyzing multi-region neural dynamics under stimulation, effectively revealing how external perturbations reorganize cross-regional structure.

Abstract: Disentangling shared network-level dynamics from region-specific activity is
a central challenge in modeling multi-region neural data. We introduce SPIRE
(Shared-Private Inter-Regional Encoder), a deep multi-encoder autoencoder that
factorizes recordings into shared and private latent subspaces with novel
alignment and disentanglement losses. Trained solely on baseline data, SPIRE
robustly recovers cross-regional structure and reveals how external
perturbations reorganize it. On synthetic benchmarks with ground-truth latents,
SPIRE outperforms classical probabilistic models under nonlinear distortions
and temporal misalignments. Applied to intracranial deep brain stimulation
(DBS) recordings, SPIRE shows that shared latents reliably encode
stimulation-specific signatures that generalize across sites and frequencies.
These results establish SPIRE as a practical, reproducible tool for analyzing
multi-region neural dynamics under stimulation.

TL;DR: Radiomics ML models are vulnerable to distribution shifts from imaging variations. This study systematically evaluates robustness across MRI sequences, showing protocol-invariant features maintain >0.85 F1-scores while standard features degrade 40% under protocol changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiomics-based machine learning models show promise for clinical decision support but are vulnerable to distribution shifts caused by variations in imaging protocols, positioning, and segmentation.

Method: Used a phantom of 16 fruits to evaluate distribution shifts across 5 MRI sequences (T2-HASTE, T2-TSE, T2-MAP, T1-TSE, T2-FLAIR) with variations in protocols, segmentation (full, partial, rotated), and inter-observer variability. Trained XGBoost classifiers on 8 consistent robust features vs sequence-specific features.

Result: Models trained on protocol-invariant features maintained F1-scores >0.85 across distribution shifts, while models using all features showed 40% performance degradation under protocol changes. Dataset augmentation improved uncertainty estimates and reduced expected calibration error by 35% without sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: Protocol-aware feature selection and controlled phantom studies effectively predict model behavior under distribution shifts, providing a framework for developing robust radiomics models resilient to real-world protocol variations.

Abstract: Radiomics-based machine learning models show promise for clinical decision
support but are vulnerable to distribution shifts caused by variations in
imaging protocols, positioning, and segmentation. This study systematically
investigates the robustness of radiomics-based machine learning models under
distribution shifts across five MRI sequences. We evaluated how different
acquisition protocols and segmentation strategies affect model reliability in
terms of predictive power and uncertainty-awareness. Using a phantom of 16
fruits, we evaluated distribution shifts through: (1) protocol variations
across T2-HASTE, T2-TSE, T2-MAP, T1-TSE, and T2-FLAIR sequences; (2)
segmentation variations (full, partial, rotated); and (3) inter-observer
variability. We trained XGBoost classifiers on 8 consistent robust features
versus sequence-specific features, testing model performance under in-domain
and out-of-domain conditions. Results demonstrate that models trained on
protocol-invariant features maintain F1-scores >0.85 across distribution
shifts, while models using all features showed 40% performance degradation
under protocol changes. Dataset augmentation substantially improved the quality
of uncertainty estimates and reduced the expected calibration error (ECE) by
35% without sacrificing accuracy. Temperature scaling provided minimal
calibration benefits, confirming XGBoost's inherent reliability. Our findings
reveal that protocol-aware feature selection and controlled phantom studies
effectively predict model behavior under distribution shifts, providing a
framework for developing robust radiomics models resilient to real-world
protocol variations.

Motivation: Current evaluation methods for causal discovery struggle to properly assess progress, especially under latent confounding, making it difficult to measure real improvements in the field.

Method: Develops a graph distance measure for acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) based on cause-effect estimation under unobserved confounding, using identification via fixing and symbolic verification to quantify how graph differences distort treatment-outcome estimands.

Result: The proposed measure is analyzed under different graph perturbations and compared against existing distance metrics, showing its effectiveness in evaluating causal discovery methods.

Conclusion: The new graph distance measure provides a more meaningful evaluation framework for causal discovery by focusing on practical downstream tasks like cause-effect estimation rather than just structural differences.

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to recover graphs that represent causal relations among
given variables from observations, and new methods are constantly being
proposed. Increasingly, the community raises questions about how much progress
is made, because properly evaluating discovered graphs remains notoriously
difficult, particularly under latent confounding. We propose a graph distance
measure for acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) based on the downstream task
of cause-effect estimation under unobserved confounding. Our approach uses
identification via fixing and a symbolic verifier to quantify how graph
differences distort cause-effect estimands for different treatment-outcome
pairs. We analyze the behavior of the measure under different graph
perturbations and compare it against existing distance metrics.

*Zhifeng Wang,Longlong Li,Chunyan Zeng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces DWMGrad, a novel optimization algorithm that addresses limitations of existing methods like SGD and Adam by incorporating dynamic guidance mechanisms for momentum and learning rate updates, achieving faster convergence and higher accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam) have limitations in handling learning efficiency fluctuations, complex models, and non-convex optimization problems, particularly in selecting appropriate learning rates, avoiding local optima, and navigating high-dimensional spaces.

Method: DWMGrad builds on traditional methods by incorporating a dynamic guidance mechanism that uses historical data to dynamically update momentum and learning rates, allowing flexible adjustment of reliance on historical information to adapt to various training scenarios.

Result: Extensive experimentation validates that DWMGrad achieves faster convergence rates and higher accuracies across multiple scenarios compared to traditional optimization algorithms.

Conclusion: DWMGrad's dynamic guidance mechanism enables better adaptation to changing environments and task complexities, making it a more effective optimization algorithm for deep learning applications.

Abstract: Within the current sphere of deep learning research, despite the extensive
application of optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent
(SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), there remains a pronounced
inadequacy in their capability to address fluctuations in learning efficiency,
meet the demands of complex models, and tackle non-convex optimization issues.
These challenges primarily arise from the algorithms' limitations in handling
complex data structures and models, for instance, difficulties in selecting an
appropriate learning rate, avoiding local optima, and navigating through
high-dimensional spaces. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel
optimization algorithm named DWMGrad. This algorithm, building on the
foundations of traditional methods, incorporates a dynamic guidance mechanism
reliant on historical data to dynamically update momentum and learning rates.
This allows the optimizer to flexibly adjust its reliance on historical
information, adapting to various training scenarios. This strategy not only
enables the optimizer to better adapt to changing environments and task
complexities but also, as validated through extensive experimentation,
demonstrates DWMGrad's ability to achieve faster convergence rates and higher
accuracies under a multitude of scenarios.

Method: Bounded Numerical Differentiation (BOND) - a perturbative method for estimating partial derivatives across network structures with inaccessible computational graphs.

Result: BOND shows improved accuracy and scalability over existing perturbative methods. Black-box functions (fixed, untrained networks) can enhance model performance without increasing trainable parameters, achieved without extensive optimization.

Conclusion: Fixed, non-trainable modules can expand model capacity, suggesting a path toward combining analogue and digital devices as a mechanism for scaling networks.

Abstract: We introduce Bounded Numerical Differentiation (BOND), a perturbative method

black-box functions, realized in our experiments as fixed, untrained networks,
can enhance model performance without increasing the number of trainable
parameters. This improvement is achieved without extensive optimization of the
architecture or properties of the black-box function itself. Our findings
highlight the potential of leveraging fixed, non-trainable modules to expand

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PESO is a continual learning method for LLM-based recommendation that uses proximal regularization to anchor current adapters to their most recent frozen states, enabling flexible balance between adaptation and preservation of recent user behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA-based continual learning methods focus on preserving past performance, but this is problematic for recommendation systems where past preferences may become outdated and even harmful when user interests shift significantly over time.

Method: PESO introduces a proximal regularizer that anchors the current adapter to its most recent frozen state, providing data-aware, direction-wise guidance in the LoRA subspace to balance adaptation and preservation.

Result: Empirically, PESO consistently outperforms existing LoRA-based continual learning methods in recommendation tasks.

Conclusion: The proximal regularization approach in PESO effectively addresses the unique challenges of continual learning in recommendation systems by enabling flexible adaptation while preventing outdated preferences from harming current performance.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance in
recommendation, they face challenges in continual learning as users, items, and
user preferences evolve over time. Existing LoRA-based continual methods
primarily focus on preserving performance on previous tasks, but this overlooks
the unique nature of recommendation: the goal is not to predict past
preferences, and outdated preferences can even harm performance when current
interests shift significantly. To address this, we propose PESO (Proximally
rEgularized Single evolving lOra, a continual adaptation method for LoRA in
recommendation. PESO introduces a proximal regularizer that anchors the current
adapter to its most recent frozen state, enabling the model to flexibly balance
adaptation and preservation, and to better capture recent user behaviors.
Theoretically, we show that this proximal design provides data-aware,
direction-wise guidance in the LoRA subspace. Empirically, PESO consistently
outperforms existing LoRA-based continual learning methods.

*Chuxun Liu,Debo Cheng,Qingfeng Chen,Jiangzhang Gan,Jiuyong Li,Lin Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairMIB is a multi-view information bottleneck framework that decomposes graphs into feature, structural, and diffusion views to mitigate complexity biases in GNNs, achieving superior fairness-utility trade-offs through contrastive learning and IPW adjacency correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs can amplify training data biases by propagating discriminatory attributes and structural imbalances, leading to unfair outcomes. Existing fairness methods often treat bias as a single source, ignoring distinct attribute and structure effects, resulting in suboptimal fairness-utility trade-offs.

Method: FairMIB decomposes graphs into feature, structural, and diffusion views. It uses contrastive learning to maximize cross-view mutual information for bias-free representation learning, integrates multi-perspective conditional information bottleneck objectives to balance utility and fairness, and employs inverse probability-weighted (IPW) adjacency correction in the diffusion view to reduce bias propagation during message passing.

Result: Experiments on five real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that FairMIB achieves state-of-the-art performance across both utility and fairness metrics.

Conclusion: FairMIB effectively addresses the limitations of existing fairness methods by separately handling attribute and structural biases through a multi-view information bottleneck approach, achieving superior performance in both fairness and utility.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel on relational data by passing messages
over node features and structure, but they can amplify training data biases,
propagating discriminatory attributes and structural imbalances into unfair
outcomes. Many fairness methods treat bias as a single source, ignoring
distinct attribute and structure effects and leading to suboptimal fairness and
utility trade-offs. To overcome this challenge, we propose FairMIB, a
multi-view information bottleneck framework designed to decompose graphs into
feature, structural, and diffusion views for mitigating complexity biases in
GNNs. Especially, the proposed FairMIB employs contrastive learning to maximize
cross-view mutual information for bias-free representation learning. It further
integrates multi-perspective conditional information bottleneck objectives to
balance task utility and fairness by minimizing mutual information with
sensitive attributes. Additionally, FairMIB introduces an inverse
probability-weighted (IPW) adjacency correction in the diffusion view, which
reduces the spread of bias propagation during message passing. Experiments on
five real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that FairMIB achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both utility and fairness metrics.

TL;DR: Distribution shift between training and test mixtures can be beneficial, improving test performance even without transfer between components. The paper identifies optimal training proportions and analyzes when such mismatch helps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the conventional wisdom that distribution shift between training and test data is always detrimental, and to explore scenarios where mismatched training proportions can actually improve test performance.

Method: Theoretical analysis of mixture distributions with different training and test proportions, examining various scenarios to identify optimal training proportions and conditions where distribution shift is beneficial.

Result: Distribution shift can be beneficial in many settings, improving test performance even when components are unrelated with no transfer between them. The analysis identifies optimal training proportions and quantifies the extent of potential improvement.

Conclusion: Distribution shift between training and test mixtures is not always harmful and can be systematically beneficial, with identifiable optimal training proportions that maximize test performance in various scenarios including compositional settings with different skill distributions.

Abstract: We consider training and testing on mixture distributions with different
training and test proportions. We show that in many settings, and in some sense
generically, distribution shift can be beneficial, and test performance can
improve due to mismatched training proportions, even if the components are
unrelated and with no transfer between components. In a variety of scenarios,
we identify the optimal training proportions and the extent to which such
distribution shift can be beneficial. We show how the same analysis applies
also to a compositional setting with differing distribution of component
"skills'' at training and test.

TL;DR: The Neural Differential Manifold (NDM) is a novel neural network architecture that incorporates geometric structure by modeling networks as differentiable manifolds with Riemannian metrics, enabling geometric regularization and interpretable representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond conventional Euclidean parameter spaces and explicitly incorporate geometric structure into neural networks, providing intrinsic regularization, enhanced generalization, and clear geometric meaning to internal representations.

Method: Three-layer architecture: Coordinate Layer for smooth chart transitions using invertible transformations, Geometric Layer generating Riemannian metric tensors via sub-networks, and Evolution Layer optimizing with dual-objective loss balancing task performance and geometric simplicity.

Result: The framework enables natural gradient descent aligned with learned manifold geometry, provides geometric regularization that penalizes excessive curvature and volume distortion, and offers unprecedented interpretability through geometrically meaningful representations.

Conclusion: NDM represents a fundamental shift towards geometrically structured, interpretable, and efficient deep learning systems with potential for more efficient optimization, enhanced continual learning, and applications in scientific discovery and controllable generative modeling, though computational challenges remain.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Neural Differential Manifold (NDM), a novel neural
network architecture that explicitly incorporates geometric structure into its
fundamental design. Departing from conventional Euclidean parameter spaces, the
NDM re-conceptualizes a neural network as a differentiable manifold where each
layer functions as a local coordinate chart, and the network parameters
directly parameterize a Riemannian metric tensor at every point. The
architecture is organized into three synergistic layers: a Coordinate Layer
implementing smooth chart transitions via invertible transformations inspired
by normalizing flows, a Geometric Layer that dynamically generates the
manifold's metric through auxiliary sub-networks, and an Evolution Layer that
optimizes both task performance and geometric simplicity through a
dual-objective loss function. This geometric regularization penalizes excessive
curvature and volume distortion, providing intrinsic regularization that
enhances generalization and robustness. The framework enables natural gradient
descent optimization aligned with the learned manifold geometry and offers
unprecedented interpretability by endowing internal representations with clear
geometric meaning. We analyze the theoretical advantages of this approach,
including its potential for more efficient optimization, enhanced continual
learning, and applications in scientific discovery and controllable generative
modeling. While significant computational challenges remain, the Neural
Differential Manifold represents a fundamental shift towards geometrically
structured, interpretable, and efficient deep learning systems.

*Yutong Zheng,Qingna Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified bilevel model for adversarial learning and investigates adversarial attacks in clustering models from a data perturbation perspective, revealing that small perturbations maintain robustness while large ones cause attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial learning is gaining attention but the mechanism of adversarial attacks is not well understood due to complex machine learning models, and there's a need for better ways to measure attack effects.

Method: The authors propose a unified bilevel model for adversarial learning and analyze adversarial attacks in clustering models from a data perturbation viewpoint.

Result: The study reveals that clustering models are robust to small data perturbations but vulnerable to larger perturbations that change clustering results, and analyzes the well-definedness of the δ-measure for quantifying attack effects.

Conclusion: The proposed bilevel model and δ-measure provide a framework for understanding and measuring adversarial attacks in clustering models, with robustness depending on perturbation size.

Abstract: Adversarial learning has been attracting more and more attention thanks to
the fast development of machine learning and artificial intelligence. However,
due to the complicated structure of most machine learning models, the mechanism
of adversarial attacks is not well interpreted. How to measure the effect of
attack is still not quite clear. In this paper, we propose a unified bilevel
model for adversarial learning. We further investigate the adversarial attack
in clustering models and interpret it from data perturbation point of view. We
reveal that when the data perturbation is relatively small, the clustering
model is robust, whereas if it is relatively large, the clustering result
changes, which leads to an attack. To measure the effect of attacks for
clustering models, we analyse the well-definedness of the so-called
$\delta$-measure, which can be used in the proposed bilevel model for
adversarial learning of clustering models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient representations for physics-based hyperbolic wave propagation data, motivated by theoretical proofs of efficient representation existence for this wave class.

Method: Uses specialized neural network architecture called low rank neural representation (LRNR) within a hypernetwork framework, combining deep learning techniques to learn low-dimensional representations directly from data.

Result: Learned low rank tensor representations naturally emerge in trained LRNRs, revealing new decomposition of wave propagation with interpretable physical features per mode, and enabling efficient inference via compression.

Conclusion: LRNR architecture successfully learns efficient low-dimensional representations for hyperbolic wave propagation that are both interpretable and enable efficient inference through compression, making it suitable for demanding performance applications.

Abstract: We present a data-driven dimensionality reduction method that is well-suited
for physics-based data representing hyperbolic wave propagation. The method
utilizes a specialized neural network architecture called low rank neural
representation (LRNR) inside a hypernetwork framework. The architecture is
motivated by theoretical results that rigorously prove the existence of
efficient representations for this wave class. We illustrate through archetypal
examples that such an efficient low-dimensional representation of propagating
waves can be learned directly from data through a combination of deep learning
techniques. We observe that a low rank tensor representation arises naturally
in the trained LRNRs, and that this reveals a new decomposition of wave
propagation where each decomposed mode corresponds to interpretable physical
features. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LRNR architecture enables
efficient inference via a compression scheme, which is a potentially important
feature when deploying LRNRs in demanding performance regimes.

TL;DR: BRIDGE is a unified architecture that jointly learns from sequential and relational data by coupling sequence encoders with graph neural networks, enabling token-level message passing between neighboring sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world datasets often contain both sequential events and relational interactions, but existing methods typically handle only one modality. The authors argue sequences and graphs are complementary and should be learned jointly.

Method: BRIDGE combines sequence encoders with GNNs under a single objective, allowing gradient flow across both modules. It introduces TOKENXATTN for token-level cross-attention message passing between events in neighboring sequences.

Result: BRIDGE consistently outperforms static GNNs, temporal graph methods, and sequence-only baselines on ranking and classification metrics across friendship prediction (Brightkite) and fraud detection (Amazon) tasks.

Conclusion: Joint learning of sequences and graphs through the BRIDGE architecture provides superior performance compared to methods that handle only one modality, demonstrating the complementary nature of sequential and relational data.

Abstract: Many real-world datasets are both sequential and relational: each node
carries an event sequence while edges encode interactions. Existing methods in
sequence modeling and graph modeling often neglect one modality or the other.
We argue that sequences and graphs are not separate problems but complementary
facets of the same dataset, and should be learned jointly. We introduce BRIDGE,
a unified end-to-end architecture that couples a sequence encoder with a GNN
under a single objective, allowing gradients to flow across both modules and
learning task-aligned representations. To enable fine-grained token-level
message passing among neighbors, we add TOKENXATTN, a token-level
cross-attention layer that passes messages between events in neighboring
sequences. Across two settings, friendship prediction (Brightkite) and fraud
detection (Amazon), BRIDGE consistently outperforms static GNNs, temporal graph
methods, and sequence-only baselines on ranking and classification metrics.

### [121] [An Analysis of Causal Effect Estimation using Outcome Invariant Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25128)
*Uzair Akbar,Niki Kilbertus,Hao Shen,Krikamol Muandet,Bo Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework connecting data augmentation (DA) with causal inference, showing that DA can help reduce bias in causal effect estimation when outcome mechanisms are invariant to DA choices. The authors introduce IV-like regression to handle unobserved confounding when instrumental variables are unavailable, and demonstrate improved performance through theoretical analysis and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The main motivation is to extend data augmentation beyond i.i.d. settings for causal generalization across interventions. When instrumental variables (IVs) are not readily available, DA can serve as a substitute to mitigate confounding bias in causal effect estimation.

Method: The authors propose a unifying framework that treats DA as interventions on treatment mechanisms when outcome generation is invariant. They introduce IV-like regression to relax strict IV requirements and show how parameterized DA can simulate worst-case scenarios to improve causal estimation.

Result: Theoretical analysis for population cases and simulation experiments with linear examples demonstrate that the proposed approach improves causal estimation and generalization beyond simple DA. Real data experiments further support the effectiveness of the method.

Conclusion: Data augmentation can be effectively used for causal inference beyond i.i.d. settings, serving as a substitute for instrumental variables when unavailable. The IV-like regression framework with parameterized DA provides improved performance in causal effect estimation and generalization across interventions.

Abstract: The technique of data augmentation (DA) is often used in machine learning for
regularization purposes to better generalize under i.i.d. settings. In this
work, we present a unifying framework with topics in causal inference to make a
case for the use of DA beyond just the i.i.d. setting, but for generalization
across interventions as well. Specifically, we argue that when the outcome
generating mechanism is invariant to our choice of DA, then such augmentations
can effectively be thought of as interventions on the treatment generating
mechanism itself. This can potentially help to reduce bias in causal effect
estimation arising from hidden confounders. In the presence of such unobserved
confounding we typically make use of instrumental variables (IVs) -- sources of
treatment randomization that are conditionally independent of the outcome.
However, IVs may not be as readily available as DA for many applications, which
is the main motivation behind this work. By appropriately regularizing IV based
estimators, we introduce the concept of IV-like (IVL) regression for mitigating
confounding bias and improving predictive performance across interventions even
when certain IV properties are relaxed. Finally, we cast parameterized DA as an
IVL regression problem and show that when used in composition can simulate a
worst-case application of such DA, further improving performance on causal
estimation and generalization tasks beyond what simple DA may offer. This is
shown both theoretically for the population case and via simulation experiments
for the finite sample case using a simple linear example. We also present real
data experiments to support our case.

### [122] [Lipschitz-aware Linearity Grafting for Certified Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25130)
*Yongjin Han,Suhyun Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how linearity grafting into non-linear activation functions reduces approximation errors and tightens local Lipschitz constants, thereby improving certified robustness against adversarial examples without requiring certified training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of obtaining tight local Lipschitz constants for certified robustness, as existing over-approximation methods suffer from significant approximation errors that hinder robustness certification.

Method: The proposed method involves Lipschitz-aware linearity grafting that selectively grafts linearity into non-linear activation functions, which are identified as the dominant source of approximation errors, to eliminate relaxation requirements and tighten local Lipschitz constants.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that grafting linearity into influential activations tightens the l∞ local Lipschitz constant and enhances certified robustness, even without certified training.

Conclusion: Linearity grafting improves certified robustness by eliminating approximation errors in non-linear activation functions, providing tighter local Lipschitz constants and better adversarial defense capabilities.

Abstract: Lipschitz constant is a fundamental property in certified robustness, as
smaller values imply robustness to adversarial examples when a model is
confident in its prediction. However, identifying the worst-case adversarial
examples is known to be an NP-complete problem. Although over-approximation
methods have shown success in neural network verification to address this
challenge, reducing approximation errors remains a significant obstacle.
Furthermore, these approximation errors hinder the ability to obtain tight
local Lipschitz constants, which are crucial for certified robustness.
Originally, grafting linearity into non-linear activation functions was
proposed to reduce the number of unstable neurons, enabling scalable and
complete verification. However, no prior theoretical analysis has explained how
linearity grafting improves certified robustness. We instead consider linearity
grafting primarily as a means of eliminating approximation errors rather than
reducing the number of unstable neurons, since linear functions do not require
relaxation. In this paper, we provide two theoretical contributions: 1) why
linearity grafting improves certified robustness through the lens of the
$l_\infty$ local Lipschitz constant, and 2) grafting linearity into non-linear
activation functions, the dominant source of approximation errors, yields a
tighter local Lipschitz constant. Based on these theoretical contributions, we
propose a Lipschitz-aware linearity grafting method that removes dominant
approximation errors, which are crucial for tightening the local Lipschitz
constant, thereby improving certified robustness, even without certified
training. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that grafting linearity into
these influential activations tightens the $l_\infty$ local Lipschitz constant
and enhances certified robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Utilities need to rapidly solve OPS problems to mitigate wildfire ignition risks by de-energizing power lines, but these MILPs are computationally challenging and must be solved frequently in operational settings. The shared structure across OPS instances with varying parameters motivates using ML to exploit patterns.

Method: Developed an ML-guided framework that extends existing ML-guided MILP solution methods while integrating domain knowledge about the number of energized and de-energized lines to quickly produce high-quality de-energization decisions.

Result: Testing on a large-scale realistic California-based synthetic test system showed that the proposed ML-guided method produces high-quality solutions faster than traditional optimization methods.

Conclusion: The ML-guided framework effectively addresses the computational challenges of OPS problems by leveraging shared patterns across instances and domain knowledge, enabling faster and high-quality solutions for wildfire risk management.

Abstract: To mitigate acute wildfire ignition risks, utilities de-energize power lines
in high-risk areas. The Optimal Power Shutoff (OPS) problem optimizes line
energization statuses to manage wildfire ignition risks through
de-energizations while reducing load shedding. OPS problems are computationally
challenging Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILPs) that must be solved rapidly
and frequently in operational settings. For a particular power system, OPS
instances share a common structure with varying parameters related to wildfire
risks, loads, and renewable generation. This motivates the use of Machine
Learning (ML) for solving OPS problems by exploiting shared patterns across
instances. In this paper, we develop an ML-guided framework that quickly
produces high-quality de-energization decisions by extending existing ML-guided
MILP solution methods while integrating domain knowledge on the number of
energized and de-energized lines. Results on a large-scale realistic
California-based synthetic test system show that the proposed ML-guided method
produces high-quality solutions faster than traditional optimization methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a co-optimization approach for distributed machine learning that simultaneously optimizes CPU resource allocation and local model training across computing nodes, achieving over 50% improvement in cost optimality compared to existing solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demand for fast, computationally efficient, and scalable AI solutions requires optimized computing resources for distributed machine learning and optimization across networked computing nodes.

Method: The proposed algorithm formulates a co-optimization setup that optimally assigns CPU usage while training each computing node locally with its data share. It handles time-varying information-sharing networks with balanced weights, ensures all-time feasibility of resource-demand constraints, and supports log-scale quantization for data exchange.

Result: The algorithm achieves more than 50% improvement in cost optimality gap compared to existing CPU scheduling solutions. Convergence towards optimal performance is proven using perturbation theory, Lyapunov stability, and eigen-spectrum analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed distributed optimization framework successfully addresses the dual challenge of optimal CPU resource allocation and efficient distributed machine learning training, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing approaches.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving research on artificial intelligence (AI) the demand
for fast, computationally efficient, and scalable solutions has increased in
recent years. The problem of optimizing the computing resources for distributed
machine learning (ML) and optimization is considered in this paper. Given a set
of data distributed over a network of computing-nodes/servers, the idea is to
optimally assign the CPU (central processing unit) usage while simultaneously
training each computing node locally via its own share of data. This formulates
the problem as a co-optimization setup to (i) optimize the data processing and
(ii) optimally allocate the computing resources. The information-sharing
network among the nodes might be time-varying, but with balanced weights to
ensure consensus-type convergence of the algorithm. The algorithm is all-time
feasible, which implies that the computing resource-demand balance constraint
holds at all iterations of the proposed solution. Moreover, the solution allows
addressing possible log-scale quantization over the information-sharing
channels to exchange log-quantized data. For some example applications,
distributed support-vector-machine (SVM) and regression are considered as the
ML training models. Results from perturbation theory, along with Lyapunov
stability and eigen-spectrum analysis, are used to prove the convergence
towards the optimal case. As compared to existing CPU scheduling solutions, the
proposed algorithm improves the cost optimality gap by more than $50\%$.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A selective learning strategy for deep time series forecasting that uses dual-mask mechanism to filter uncertain and anomalous timesteps during optimization, significantly reducing overfitting and improving performance across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for time series forecasting suffer from severe overfitting due to vulnerability to noise and anomalies, as current methods uniformly optimize all timesteps through MSE loss without distinguishing between generalizable and non-generalizable timesteps.

Method: Proposes selective learning with dual-mask mechanism: (1) uncertainty mask using residual entropy to filter uncertain timesteps, (2) anomaly mask using residual lower bound estimation to exclude anomalous timesteps. Only screens a subset of timesteps for MSE loss calculation.

Result: Extensive experiments on 8 real-world datasets show significant improvements: 37.4% MSE reduction for Informer, 8.4% for TimesNet, and 6.5% for iTransformer. Demonstrates selective learning can enhance performance of state-of-the-art deep models.

Conclusion: Selective learning strategy effectively addresses overfitting in deep time series forecasting by focusing on generalizable timesteps while disregarding uncertain and anomalous ones, leading to substantial performance gains across various models.

Abstract: Benefiting from high capacity for capturing complex temporal patterns, deep
learning (DL) has significantly advanced time series forecasting (TSF).
However, deep models tend to suffer from severe overfitting due to the inherent
vulnerability of time series to noise and anomalies. The prevailing DL paradigm
uniformly optimizes all timesteps through the MSE loss and learns those
uncertain and anomalous timesteps without difference, ultimately resulting in
overfitting. To address this, we propose a novel selective learning strategy
for deep TSF. Specifically, selective learning screens a subset of the whole
timesteps to calculate the MSE loss in optimization, guiding the model to focus
on generalizable timesteps while disregarding non-generalizable ones. Our
framework introduces a dual-mask mechanism to target timesteps: (1) an
uncertainty mask leveraging residual entropy to filter uncertain timesteps, and
(2) an anomaly mask employing residual lower bound estimation to exclude
anomalous timesteps. Extensive experiments across eight real-world datasets
demonstrate that selective learning can significantly improve the predictive
performance for typical state-of-the-art deep models, including 37.4% MSE
reduction for Informer, 8.4% for TimesNet, and 6.5% for iTransformer.

Motivation: Multi-class PU learning remains challenging as many existing approaches don't ensure unbiased risk estimation, limiting performance and stability in real applications where annotating reliable negatives is difficult or costly.

Method: Proposed a cost-sensitive multi-class PU method based on adaptive loss weighting within the empirical risk minimization framework, assigning distinct data-dependent weights to positive and inferred-negative loss components to create an unbiased empirical risk estimator.

Result: Extensive experiments on eight public datasets with varying class priors and numbers of classes show consistent gains over strong baselines in both accuracy and stability.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive loss weighting approach effectively addresses the multi-class PU learning challenge by providing unbiased risk estimation and demonstrates superior performance across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Positive--Unlabeled (PU) learning considers settings in which only positive
and unlabeled data are available, while negatives are missing or left
unlabeled. This situation is common in real applications where annotating
reliable negatives is difficult or costly. Despite substantial progress in PU
learning, the multi-class case (MPU) remains challenging: many existing
approaches do not ensure \emph{unbiased risk estimation}, which limits
performance and stability. We propose a cost-sensitive multi-class PU method
based on \emph{adaptive loss weighting}. Within the empirical risk minimization
framework, we assign distinct, data-dependent weights to the positive and
\emph{inferred-negative} (from the unlabeled mixture) loss components so that
the resulting empirical objective is an unbiased estimator of the target risk.
We formalize the MPU data-generating process and establish a generalization
error bound for the proposed estimator. Extensive experiments on \textbf{eight}
public datasets, spanning varying class priors and numbers of classes, show
consistent gains over strong baselines in both accuracy and stability.

### [127] [BSFA: Leveraging the Subspace Dichotomy to Accelerate Neural Network Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25244)
*Wenjie Zhou,Bohan Wang,Wei Chen,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BSFA is a plug-and-play framework that accelerates deep learning training by differentially scaling parameter updates in Dom-space (top eigendirections) and Bulk-space (orthogonal component), achieving 2x speedup on LLaMA models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent studies show that parameter updates along top Hessian eigendirections (Dom-space) have large magnitude but minimal loss reduction, while updates in orthogonal Bulk-space drive most learning progress despite smaller magnitudes.

Method: BSFA uses PCA on historical updates for efficient subspace estimation and applies block-wise strategy for scalability. It moderates Dom-space updates for stability and amplifies Bulk-space updates for faster convergence.

Result: BSFA achieves approximately 2x speedup when pre-training LLaMA-72M on WikiText-103 and LLaMA-134M on OpenWebText compared to vanilla AdamW.

Conclusion: BSFA provides a practical and scalable framework that leverages the dichotomy between Dom-space and Bulk-space updates to accelerate deep learning training while maintaining stability.

Abstract: Recent studies \citep{gur2018gradient,song2024does, wen2024understanding}
highlight a fundamental dichotomy in deep learning optimization: Although
parameter updates along the top eigendirections of the loss Hessian (Dom-space)
capture most of the update magnitude, they often contribute minimally to loss
reduction. In contrast, updates in the orthogonal component (Bulk-space) have
smaller magnitudes but drive most learning progress. In this work, we further
advance the understanding of this phenomenon and introduce the
\textbf{Bulk-Space-Filtration-Accelerator (BSFA)}, a novel plug-and-play
framework. BSFA accelerates training by differentially scaling update
components projected onto these distinct subspaces, simultaneously enhancing
stability by moderating updates in the dominant subspace and boosting
convergence speed by amplifying those in the bulk-space. To ensure BSFA is both
practical and scalable for contemporary large models, we introduce two key
innovations: an efficient estimator using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on
historical updates for fast subspace estimation, and a block-wise strategy that
applies this estimation on a per-parameter-block basis. These designs make BSFA
computationally tractable and highly effective. We demonstrate BSFA's
acceleration across various tasks, notably achieving approximately 2$\times$
speedup when pre-training LLaMA-72M on WikiText-103 and LLaMA-134M on
OpenWebText compared to vanilla AdamW.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Efficient techniques for Bayesian network structure sampling: optimized basic moves and parent set pruning for faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian network structure inference via Markov chain sampling is computationally expensive, requiring improvements in efficiency for basic operations and parent set computations.

Method: Two techniques: 1) Efficient implementation of basic graph moves (add/delete/reverse arcs), 2) Preprocessing method to prune parent sets while approximately preserving sums needed for sophisticated moves.

Result: Empirical study shows substantial efficiency gains compared to previous methods, with faster sampling convergence.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques significantly improve the efficiency of Bayesian network structure sampling, making Bayesian inference more practical for complex networks.

Abstract: Bayesian inference of Bayesian network structures is often performed by
sampling directed acyclic graphs along an appropriately constructed Markov
chain. We present two techniques to improve sampling. First, we give an
efficient implementation of basic moves, which add, delete, or reverse a single
arc. Second, we expedite summing over parent sets, an expensive task required
for more sophisticated moves: we devise a preprocessing method to prune
possible parent sets so as to approximately preserve the sums. Our empirical
study shows that our techniques can yield substantial efficiency gains compared
to previous methods.

*Xiandong Zou,Pan Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IBNorm is a new normalization method based on Information Bottleneck principle that outperforms traditional variance-centric methods like BatchNorm, LayerNorm, and RMSNorm across language and vision models by preserving predictive information while suppressing nuisance variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing normalization methods focus on variance control without directly optimizing how representations capture task-relevant information, limiting their ability to produce informative embeddings.

Method: IBNorm introduces bounded compression operations grounded in Information Bottleneck principle to encourage embeddings to preserve predictive information while suppressing nuisance variability.

Result: IBNorm consistently outperforms BatchNorm, LayerNorm, and RMSNorm across large-scale language models (LLaMA, GPT-2) and vision models (ResNet, ViT), with mutual information analysis confirming superior information bottleneck behavior.

Conclusion: IBNorm provides a more effective normalization approach that yields more informative representations while maintaining the stability and compatibility of standard normalization methods.

Abstract: Normalization is fundamental to deep learning, but existing approaches such
as BatchNorm, LayerNorm, and RMSNorm are variance-centric by enforcing zero
mean and unit variance, stabilizing training without controlling how
representations capture task-relevant information. We propose IB-Inspired
Normalization (IBNorm), a simple yet powerful family of methods grounded in the
Information Bottleneck principle. IBNorm introduces bounded compression
operations that encourage embeddings to preserve predictive information while
suppressing nuisance variability, yielding more informative representations
while retaining the stability and compatibility of standard normalization.
Theoretically, we prove that IBNorm achieves a higher IB value and tighter
generalization bounds than variance-centric methods. Empirically, IBNorm
consistently outperforms BatchNorm, LayerNorm, and RMSNorm across large-scale
language models (LLaMA, GPT-2) and vision models (ResNet, ViT), with mutual
information analysis confirming superior information bottleneck behavior. Code
will be released publicly.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This thesis addresses neural network instability through sensitivity analysis, combining Lipschitz constraints for input robustness, curvature regularization for smooth optimization, and randomized smoothing for decision boundary stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models suffer from instability and vulnerability to small input changes, and optimization challenges due to sharp loss landscapes, requiring principled approaches to improve robustness and training stability.

Method: Uses Lipschitz networks to constrain input sensitivity, introduces curvature-based regularization for smoother optimization landscapes, and explores randomized smoothing for probabilistic robustness at decision boundaries.

Result: Develops a unified framework combining Lipschitz continuity, randomized smoothing, and curvature regularization, with contributions including efficient spectral norm computation, novel Lipschitz-constrained layers, and improved certification procedures.

Conclusion: The sensitivity analysis perspective provides a comprehensive approach to addressing neural network stability challenges, offering both theoretical foundations and practical methodologies for improved robustness and training.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success across a wide range of tasks,
but its models often suffer from instability and vulnerability: small changes
to the input may drastically affect predictions, while optimization can be
hindered by sharp loss landscapes. This thesis addresses these issues through
the unifying perspective of sensitivity analysis, which examines how neural
networks respond to perturbations at both the input and parameter levels.
  We study Lipschitz networks as a principled way to constrain sensitivity to
input perturbations, thereby improving generalization, adversarial robustness,
and training stability. To complement this architectural approach, we introduce
regularization techniques based on the curvature of the loss function,
promoting smoother optimization landscapes and reducing sensitivity to
parameter variations. Randomized smoothing is also explored as a probabilistic
method for enhancing robustness at decision boundaries.
  By combining these perspectives, we develop a unified framework where
Lipschitz continuity, randomized smoothing, and curvature regularization
interact to address fundamental challenges in stability. The thesis contributes
both theoretical analysis and practical methodologies, including efficient
spectral norm computation, novel Lipschitz-constrained layers, and improved
certification procedures.

*Xizhe Wang,Xiaobin Song,Qingshan Jia,Hongbo Zhao,Benben Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hierarchical physics-embedded learning framework for spatiotemporal dynamics that combines data-driven methods with physical knowledge through a two-level architecture for both forward prediction and inverse discovery of PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modeling complex spatiotemporal dynamics in far-from-equilibrium systems is challenging due to intractable PDEs from first principles, limitations of purely data-driven models (physically inconsistent, data-intensive), and insufficient structural capacity of existing physics-informed methods.

Method: Two-level hierarchical architecture: first level learns fundamental symbolic components of PDEs, second level learns their governing combinations. Uses adaptive Fourier Neural Operators to capture non-local dependencies and high-order operators. Embeds known physical laws directly into computational graphs and structurally decouples known/unknown terms.

Result: The framework enables physical consistency, improved data efficiency, interpretable discovery of governing equations through symbolic regression without presupposing functional forms, and effective handling of sparse and noisy data.

Conclusion: The hierarchical physics-embedded learning framework fundamentally advances both forward spatiotemporal prediction and inverse discovery of physical laws by structurally integrating prior knowledge while reducing learning complexity.

Abstract: Modeling complex spatiotemporal dynamics, particularly in
far-from-equilibrium systems, remains a grand challenge in science. The
governing partial differential equations (PDEs) for these systems are often
intractable to derive from first principles, due to their inherent complexity,
characterized by high-order derivatives and strong nonlinearities, coupled with
incomplete physical knowledge. This has spurred the development of data-driven
methods, yet these approaches face limitations: Purely data-driven models are
often physically inconsistent and data-intensive, while existing
physics-informed methods lack the structural capacity to represent complex
operators or systematically integrate partial physical knowledge. Here, we
propose a hierarchical physics-embedded learning framework that fundamentally
advances both the forward spatiotemporal prediction and inverse discovery of
physical laws from sparse and noisy data. The key innovation is a two-level
architecture that mirrors the process of scientific discovery: the first level
learns fundamental symbolic components of a PDE, while the second learns their
governing combinations. This hierarchical decomposition not only reduces
learning complexity but, more importantly, enables a structural integration of
prior knowledge. Known physical laws are directly embedded into the models
computational graph, guaranteeing physical consistency and improving data
efficiency. By building the framework upon adaptive Fourier Neural Operators,
we can effectively capture the non-local dependencies and high-order operators
characteristic of dynamical systems. Additionally, by structurally decoupling
known and unknown terms, the framework further enables interpretable discovery
of underlying governing equations through symbolic regression, without
presupposing functional forms.

*Sagalpreet Singh,Rishi Saket,Aravindan Raghuveer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multi Goal RL, which aims to maximize expected return while ensuring uniform visitation of goal states, addressing limitations of existing RL methods that may focus too narrowly on specific rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL algorithms often exploit limited reward sources, but many real-world scenarios require policies that visit multiple goal states uniformly while maintaining high returns. Existing methods like entropy regularization don't guarantee dispersed state distribution over rewarding states.

Method: Proposes a novel algorithm that learns a policy mixture with dispersed marginal state distribution over goal states. Uses a custom RL reward computed based on current policy mixture and sampled trajectories, updated via offline RL. Includes an oracle classifier to identify goal states.

Result: The algorithm provides performance guarantees with efficient convergence bounds for optimizing both expected return and dispersion of marginal state distribution over goal states. Experiments conducted on synthetic MDPs and standard RL environments.

Conclusion: The proposed Multi Goal RL framework effectively addresses the challenge of learning policies that both maximize returns and ensure uniform visitation of goal states, overcoming limitations of existing RL approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning algorithms are primarily focused on learning a policy
that maximizes expected return. As a result, the learned policy can exploit one
or few reward sources. However, in many natural situations, it is desirable to
learn a policy that induces a dispersed marginal state distribution over
rewarding states, while maximizing the expected return which is typically tied
to reaching a goal state. This aspect remains relatively unexplored. Existing
techniques based on entropy regularization and intrinsic rewards use
stochasticity for encouraging exploration to find an optimal policy which may
not necessarily lead to dispersed marginal state distribution over rewarding
states. Other RL algorithms which match a target distribution assume the latter
to be available apriori. This may be infeasible in large scale systems where
enumeration of all states is not possible and a state is determined to be a
goal state only upon reaching it. We formalize the problem of maximizing the
expected return while uniformly visiting the goal states as Multi Goal RL in
which an oracle classifier over the state space determines the goal states. We
propose a novel algorithm that learns a high-return policy mixture with
marginal state distribution dispersed over the set of goal states. Our
algorithm is based on optimizing a custom RL reward which is computed - based
on the current policy mixture - at each iteration for a set of sampled
trajectories. The latter are used via an offline RL algorithm to update the
policy mixture. We prove performance guarantees for our algorithm, showing
efficient convergence bounds for optimizing a natural objective which captures
the expected return as well as the dispersion of the marginal state
distribution over the goal states. We design and perform experiments on
synthetic MDPs and standard RL environments to evaluate the effectiveness of
our algorithm.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CDFlow, a novel invertible linear layer for normalizing flows using circulant-diagonal matrix decomposition, achieving efficient computation while maintaining expressiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design linear layers for normalizing flows that enhance expressiveness while maintaining efficient computation of Jacobian determinants and inverses, addressing the computational challenges of traditional linear transformations.

Method: Proposes a novel invertible linear layer based on product of circulant and diagonal matrices, leveraging Fast Fourier Transform for efficient computation. This reduces parameter complexity from O(n²) to O(mn) and enables efficient matrix inversion and log-determinant computation.

Result: CDFlow achieves strong density estimation on natural image datasets and effectively models data with periodic structure. It significantly accelerates key operations in normalizing flows, reducing time complexity from O(n³) to O(mn log n) for inversion and O(n³) to O(mn) for log-determinant computation.

Conclusion: The circulant-diagonal decomposition provides an efficient and expressive linear layer for normalizing flows, offering practical benefits for scalable generative modeling while maintaining strong performance on various datasets.

Abstract: Normalizing flows are deep generative models that enable efficient likelihood
estimation and sampling through invertible transformations. A key challenge is
to design linear layers that enhance expressiveness while maintaining efficient
computation of the Jacobian determinant and inverse. We introduce a novel
invertible linear layer based on the product of circulant and diagonal
matrices. This decomposition reduces parameter complexity from
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$ using $m$ diagonal matrices and $m-1$
circulant matrices while still approximating general linear transformations. By
leveraging the Fast Fourier Transform, our approach reduces the time complexity
of matrix inversion from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn\log n)$ and that
of computing the log-determinant from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$,
where $n$ is the input dimension. We build upon this layer to develop
Circulant-Diagonal Flow (CDFlow), which achieves strong density estimation on
natural image datasets and effectively models data with inherent periodic
structure. Furthermore, CDFlow significantly accelerates key operations in
normalizing flows, providing practical benefits for scalable generative
modeling.

*Jie Peng,Rui Wang,Qiang Wang,Zhewei Wei,Bin Tong,Guan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses three key limitations in information cascade popularity prediction: temporal leakage in evaluation, feature-poor datasets, and computational inefficiency. It proposes time-ordered data splitting, introduces the Taoke e-commerce dataset with purchase conversions, and develops the lightweight CasTemp framework for efficient cascade modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cascade prediction methods suffer from three critical issues: temporal evaluation leakage allowing access to future information, limited datasets lacking downstream conversion signals, and computationally inefficient graph-based methods that take days to train for marginal improvements.

Method: Three-pronged approach: (1) Time-ordered splitting strategy for chronological data partitioning without future information leakage; (2) Taoke dataset with rich promoter/product attributes and purchase conversions; (3) CasTemp framework using temporal walks, Jaccard-based neighbor selection, and GRU encoding with time-aware attention.

Result: CasTemp achieves state-of-the-art performance across four datasets with orders-of-magnitude speedup under leak-free evaluation. It particularly excels at predicting second-stage popularity conversions, which is critical for real-world applications.

Conclusion: The proposed solutions systematically address fundamental limitations in cascade prediction through proper task setup, comprehensive dataset construction, and efficient model design, enabling practical and scalable information cascade analysis.

Abstract: Information cascade popularity prediction is a key problem in analyzing
content diffusion in social networks. However, current related works suffer
from three critical limitations: (1) temporal leakage in current
evaluation--random cascade-based splits allow models to access future
information, yielding unrealistic results; (2) feature-poor datasets that lack
downstream conversion signals (e.g., likes, comments, or purchases), which
limits more practical applications; (3) computational inefficiency of complex
graph-based methods that require days of training for marginal gains. We
systematically address these challenges from three perspectives: task setup,
dataset construction, and model design. First, we propose a time-ordered
splitting strategy that chronologically partitions data into consecutive
windows, ensuring models are evaluated on genuine forecasting tasks without
future information leakage. Second, we introduce Taoke, a large-scale
e-commerce cascade dataset featuring rich promoter/product attributes and
ground-truth purchase conversions--capturing the complete diffusion lifecycle
from promotion to monetization. Third, we develop CasTemp, a lightweight
framework that efficiently models cascade dynamics through temporal walks,
Jaccard-based neighbor selection for inter-cascade dependencies, and GRU-based
encoding with time-aware attention. Under leak-free evaluation, CasTemp
achieves state-of-the-art performance across four datasets with
orders-of-magnitude speedup. Notably, it excels at predicting second-stage
popularity conversions--a practical task critical for real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hypergraphs naturally model higher-order interactions but lack theoretical foundations in semi-supervised learning. The paper aims to establish theoretical consistency and develop effective learning methods for hypergraphs.

Method: Proposes Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL) which regularizes using powers of Laplacians from skeleton graphs to achieve multiscale smoothness. The method converges to a higher-order Sobolev seminorm.

Result: The paper provides asymptotic consistency analysis showing convergence to a weighted p-Laplacian equation. Empirically, HOHL performs strongly on standard baselines.

Conclusion: The theoretical analysis establishes conditions for well-posed hypergraph learning and convergence properties, while the proposed HOHL method effectively leverages higher-order regularization for improved performance.

Abstract: Hypergraphs provide a natural framework for modeling higher-order
interactions, yet their theoretical underpinnings in semi-supervised learning
remain limited. We provide an asymptotic consistency analysis of variational
learning on random geometric hypergraphs, precisely characterizing the
conditions ensuring the well-posedness of hypergraph learning as well as
showing convergence to a weighted $p$-Laplacian equation. Motivated by this, we
propose Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL), which regularizes via powers
of Laplacians from skeleton graphs for multiscale smoothness. HOHL converges to
a higher-order Sobolev seminorm. Empirically, it performs strongly on standard
baselines.

*Rupesh Sapkota,Caglar Demir,Arnab Sharma,Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces model merging via weighted averaging for knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models as an alternative to traditional ensemble methods, showing improved performance with reduced computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ensemble methods for KGE models require training multiple models, which increases computational overhead, latency, and memory usage. Model merging approaches offer a promising alternative that avoids these drawbacks.

Method: The authors propose two weighted averaging approaches: (1) maintaining a running average of model parameters from each training epoch, and (2) selectively updating the running average only when generalization performance improves on validation data. They evaluate these approaches on link prediction tasks and extend to literal-augmented KGE models and multi-hop query answering.

Result: The proposed weighted averaging approach consistently improves performance across diverse evaluation settings compared to state-of-the-art benchmark ensemble approaches.

Conclusion: Weighted averaging provides an effective model merging technique for KGE models that outperforms traditional ensemble methods while reducing computational overhead and resource requirements.

Abstract: Ensemble methods are widely employed to improve generalization in machine
learning. This has also prompted the adoption of ensemble learning for the
knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models in performing link prediction. Typical
approaches to this end train multiple models as part of the ensemble, and the
diverse predictions are then averaged. However, this approach has some
significant drawbacks. For instance, the computational overhead of training
multiple models increases latency and memory overhead. In contrast, model
merging approaches offer a promising alternative that does not require training
multiple models. In this work, we introduce model merging, specifically
weighted averaging, in KGE models. Herein, a running average of model
parameters from a training epoch onward is maintained and used for predictions.
To address this, we additionally propose an approach that selectively updates
the running average of the ensemble model parameters only when the
generalization performance improves on a validation dataset. We evaluate these
two different weighted averaging approaches on link prediction tasks, comparing
the state-of-the-art benchmark ensemble approach. Additionally, we evaluate the
weighted averaging approach considering literal-augmented KGE models and
multi-hop query answering tasks as well. The results demonstrate that the
proposed weighted averaging approach consistently improves performance across
diverse evaluation settings.

*Tomas Hrycej,Bernhard Bermeitinger,Massimo Pavone,Götz-Henrik Wiegand,Siegfried Handschuh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-phase optimization algorithm that leverages the transition from non-convex to convex regions in loss functions, using Adam for non-convex regions and Conjugate Gradient for convex regions to achieve improved convergence and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning optimization often relies on non-convex methods like Adam due to the prevalence of non-convex loss functions, but local minima imply convex regions where second-order methods could provide guaranteed superlinear convergence.

Method: A two-phase optimization framework that detects the transition point from non-convex to convex regions by observing gradient norm dependence on loss, then switches between Adam (for non-convex regions) and Conjugate Gradient (for convex regions).

Result: Computing experiments confirm that this convexity structure is frequent enough in real-world tasks to be practically exploited, leading to substantial improvements in convergence and accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid optimization approach effectively leverages the natural transition from non-convex to convex regions in loss functions, providing a practical method to combine the strengths of both optimization paradigms.

Abstract: The key task of machine learning is to minimize the loss function that
measures the model fit to the training data. The numerical methods to do this
efficiently depend on the properties of the loss function. The most decisive
among these properties is the convexity or non-convexity of the loss function.
The fact that the loss function can have, and frequently has, non-convex
regions has led to a widespread commitment to non-convex methods such as Adam.
However, a local minimum implies that, in some environment around it, the
function is convex. In this environment, second-order minimizing methods such
as the Conjugate Gradient (CG) give a guaranteed superlinear convergence. We
propose a novel framework grounded in the hypothesis that loss functions in
real-world tasks swap from initial non-convexity to convexity towards the
optimum. This is a property we leverage to design an innovative two-phase
optimization algorithm. The presented algorithm detects the swap point by
observing the gradient norm dependence on the loss. In these regions,
non-convex (Adam) and convex (CG) algorithms are used, respectively. Computing
experiments confirm the hypothesis that this simple convexity structure is
frequent enough to be practically exploited to substantially improve
convergence and accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To adapt PIML's success in physics to biology, which faces different constraints like multi-faceted prior knowledge, heterogeneous data, partial observability, and high-dimensional networks.

Method: BIML extends PIML by incorporating softer, probabilistic forms of prior knowledge and focuses on four pillars: uncertainty quantification, contextualization, constrained latent structure inference, and scalability, with Foundation Models and LLMs as key enablers.

Result: The paper outlines a roadmap for transitioning from PIML to BIML, emphasizing the need to address biological modeling challenges rather than treating them as obstacles.

Conclusion: BIML provides a principled framework to channel PIML-inspired innovation toward high-impact biological challenges, with recommendations for building the BIML ecosystem.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) has successfully integrated
mechanistic understanding into machine learning, particularly in domains
governed by well-known physical laws. This success has motivated efforts to
apply PIML to biology, a field rich in dynamical systems but shaped by
different constraints. Biological modeling, however, presents unique
challenges: multi-faceted and uncertain prior knowledge, heterogeneous and
noisy data, partial observability, and complex, high-dimensional networks. In
this position paper, we argue that these challenges should not be seen as
obstacles to PIML, but as catalysts for its evolution. We propose
Biology-Informed Machine Learning (BIML): a principled extension of PIML that
retains its structural grounding while adapting to the practical realities of
biology. Rather than replacing PIML, BIML retools its methods to operate under
softer, probabilistic forms of prior knowledge. We outline four foundational
pillars as a roadmap for this transition: uncertainty quantification,
contextualization, constrained latent structure inference, and scalability.
Foundation Models and Large Language Models will be key enablers, bridging
human expertise with computational modeling. We conclude with concrete
recommendations to build the BIML ecosystem and channel PIML-inspired
innovation toward challenges of high scientific and societal relevance.

TL;DR: This paper introduces new neural network architectures for learning multiple operators between function spaces, distinguishing between multiple operator learning (single network representing continuum of operators) and learning several distinct operators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific applications require approximating mappings between function spaces (operators), but most machine learning focuses on finite-dimensional spaces. There's a need for scalable approaches to learn collections of operators efficiently.

Method: Two new architectures: MNO and MONet for multiple operator learning with universal approximation guarantees. For learning several single operators, a framework for balancing architectural complexity across subnetworks. Theoretical analysis in continuous, integrable, and Lipschitz operator settings.

Result: Established universal approximation results and derived explicit scaling laws for network size vs. accuracy. Empirical experiments on parametric PDE benchmarks confirmed strong expressive power and efficiency of proposed architectures.

Conclusion: This work provides a unified theoretical and practical foundation for scalable neural operator learning across multiple operators, with both theoretical guarantees and empirical validation.

Abstract: While many problems in machine learning focus on learning mappings between
finite-dimensional spaces, scientific applications require approximating
mappings between function spaces, i.e., operators. We study the problem of
learning collections of operators and provide both theoretical and empirical
advances. We distinguish between two regimes: (i) multiple operator learning,
where a single network represents a continuum of operators parameterized by a
parametric function, and (ii) learning several distinct single operators, where
each operator is learned independently. For the multiple operator case, we
introduce two new architectures, $\mathrm{MNO}$ and $\mathrm{MONet}$, and
establish universal approximation results in three settings: continuous,
integrable, or Lipschitz operators. For the latter, we further derive explicit
scaling laws that quantify how the network size must grow to achieve a target
approximation accuracy. For learning several single operators, we develop a
framework for balancing architectural complexity across subnetworks and show
how approximation order determines computational efficiency. Empirical
experiments on parametric PDE benchmarks confirm the strong expressive power
and efficiency of the proposed architectures. Overall, this work establishes a
unified theoretical and practical foundation for scalable neural operator
learning across multiple operators.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GPTOpt is an LLM-based optimization method that enables large language models to perform continuous black-box optimization by fine-tuning them on synthetic datasets from diverse Bayesian Optimization parameterizations, achieving better performance than traditional optimizers without requiring parameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global optimization of expensive, derivative-free black-box functions requires extreme sample efficiency. While Bayesian Optimization can be effective, it often needs careful parameter tuning for each application domain. Meanwhile, LLMs have shown broad capabilities but remain limited in solving continuous black-box optimization tasks.

Method: Fine-tuning large language models on extensive synthetic datasets derived from diverse Bayesian Optimization parameterizations, leveraging LLM pre-training to generalize across optimization tasks.

Result: On various black-box optimization benchmarks, GPTOpt surpasses traditional optimizers, demonstrating superior performance in continuous black-box optimization tasks.

Conclusion: GPTOpt highlights the capacity of LLMs for advanced numerical reasoning and introduces a flexible framework for global optimization without parameter tuning, bridging the gap between LLM capabilities and continuous optimization tasks.

Abstract: Global optimization of expensive, derivative-free black-box functions demands
extreme sample efficiency. Classical methods such as Bayesian Optimization (BO)
can be effective, but they often require careful parameter tuning to each
application domain. At the same time, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
broad capabilities, yet state-of-the-art models remain limited in solving
continuous black-box optimization tasks. We introduce GPTOpt, an LLM-based
optimization method that equips LLMs with continuous black-box optimization
capabilities. By fine-tuning large language models on extensive synthetic
datasets derived from diverse BO parameterizations, GPTOpt leverages LLM
pre-training to generalize across optimization tasks. On a variety of black-box
optimization benchmarks, GPTOpt surpasses traditional optimizers, highlighting
the capacity of LLMs for advanced numerical reasoning and introducing a
flexible framework for global optimization without parameter tuning.

### [141] [Scalable Utility-Aware Multiclass Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25458)
*Mahmoud Hegazy,Michael I. Jordan,Aymeric Dieuleveut*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes utility calibration, a general framework for scalable evaluation of multiclass calibration that measures calibration error relative to specific utility functions relevant to end users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for assessing multiclass calibration focus on specific aspects of prediction or use computationally challenging variational formulations, lacking a scalable and comprehensive evaluation framework.

Method: The authors introduce utility calibration, which measures calibration error relative to utility functions that encapsulate end users' goals and decision criteria, unifying and re-interpreting existing calibration metrics.

Result: The framework enables more robust versions of top-class and class-wise calibration metrics, and extends beyond binarized approaches to assess calibration for richer classes of downstream utilities.

Conclusion: Utility calibration provides a scalable and general framework for multiclass calibration evaluation that can accommodate diverse end-user requirements through flexible utility functions.

Abstract: Ensuring that classifiers are well-calibrated, i.e., their predictions align
with observed frequencies, is a minimal and fundamental requirement for
classifiers to be viewed as trustworthy. Existing methods for assessing
multiclass calibration often focus on specific aspects associated with
prediction (e.g., top-class confidence, class-wise calibration) or utilize
computationally challenging variational formulations. In this work, we study
scalable \emph{evaluation} of multiclass calibration. To this end, we propose
utility calibration, a general framework that measures the calibration error
relative to a specific utility function that encapsulates the goals or decision
criteria relevant to the end user. We demonstrate how this framework can unify
and re-interpret several existing calibration metrics, particularly allowing
for more robust versions of the top-class and class-wise calibration metrics,
and, going beyond such binarized approaches, toward assessing calibration for
richer classes of downstream utilities.

### [142] [Gradient-Weight Alignment as a Train-Time Proxy for Generalization in Classification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25480)
*Florian A. Hölzl,Daniel Rueckert,Georgios Kaissis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gradient-Weight Alignment (GWA) is introduced as a robust validation metric that quantifies coherence between per-sample gradients and model weights during training, enabling generalization tracking and sample influence analysis without requiring validation data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning needs robust validation metrics to detect overfitting, monitor training dynamics, and attribute performance to individual training samples, especially in supervised classification settings.

Method: The paper introduces Gradient-Weight Alignment (GWA), which measures the alignment between per-sample gradients and model weights during training. This metric is efficiently computable during training and captures both sample-specific contributions and overall learning dynamics.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that GWA accurately predicts optimal early stopping points, enables principled model comparisons, and identifies influential training samples. Effective learning corresponds to coherent alignment, while misalignment indicates deteriorating generalization.

Conclusion: GWA provides a validation-set-free approach for model analysis directly from training data, offering a robust metric that tracks generalization during training and attributes performance to individual samples.

Abstract: Robust validation metrics remain essential in contemporary deep learning, not
only to detect overfitting and poor generalization, but also to monitor
training dynamics. In the supervised classification setting, we investigate
whether interactions between training data and model weights can yield such a
metric that both tracks generalization during training and attributes
performance to individual training samples. We introduce Gradient-Weight
Alignment (GWA), quantifying the coherence between per-sample gradients and
model weights. We show that effective learning corresponds to coherent
alignment, while misalignment indicates deteriorating generalization. GWA is
efficiently computable during training and reflects both sample-specific
contributions and dataset-wide learning dynamics. Extensive experiments show
that GWA accurately predicts optimal early stopping, enables principled model
comparisons, and identifies influential training samples, providing a
validation-set-free approach for model analysis directly from the training
data.

### [143] [Right for the Right Reasons: Avoiding Reasoning Shortcuts via Prototypical Neurosymbolic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25497)
*Luca Andolfi,Eleonora Giunchiglia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces prototypical neurosymbolic architectures to prevent reasoning shortcuts in neurosymbolic AI by ensuring models learn correct concepts rather than exploiting spurious correlations, especially in low-data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neurosymbolic AI models are prone to shortcut reasoning where they learn unintended concepts that exploit spurious correlations to satisfy symbolic constraints, compromising reliability.

Method: Leveraging prototypical learning theory, the approach trains models to satisfy background knowledge while considering input similarity to labeled datapoints, using prototype grounding as an annotation-efficient strategy.

Result: Extensive validation on the rsbench benchmark shows significant improvements in learning correct concepts across synthetic tasks (MNIST-EvenOdd, Kand-Logic) and real-world high-stake tasks (BDD-OIA) with very scarce supervision.

Conclusion: Prototype grounding is an effective strategy for safe and reliable neurosymbolic learning that prevents reasoning shortcuts and ensures models learn for the right reasons.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI is growing in popularity thanks to its ability to combine
neural perception and symbolic reasoning in end-to-end trainable models.
However, recent findings reveal these are prone to shortcut reasoning, i.e., to
learning unindented concepts--or neural predicates--which exploit spurious
correlations to satisfy the symbolic constraints. In this paper, we address
reasoning shortcuts at their root cause and we introduce prototypical
neurosymbolic architectures. These models are able to satisfy the symbolic
constraints (be right) because they have learnt the correct basic concepts (for
the right reasons) and not because of spurious correlations, even in extremely
low data regimes. Leveraging the theory of prototypical learning, we
demonstrate that we can effectively avoid reasoning shortcuts by training the
models to satisfy the background knowledge while taking into account the
similarity of the input with respect to the handful of labelled datapoints. We
extensively validate our approach on the recently proposed rsbench benchmark
suite in a variety of settings and tasks with very scarce supervision: we show
significant improvements in learning the right concepts both in synthetic tasks
(MNIST-EvenOdd and Kand-Logic) and real-world, high-stake ones (BDD-OIA). Our
findings pave the way to prototype grounding as an effective,
annotation-efficient strategy for safe and reliable neurosymbolic learning.

*Bruno W. G. Teodosio,Mário J. O. T. Lira,Pedro H. M. Araújo,Lucas R. C. Farias*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study uses machine learning (KNN, Random Forest, SVM) to predict employee burnout risk, with SVM achieving the best performance (R2=0.84) and an interactive Streamlit interface for practical application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Burnout significantly impacts individual well-being and organizational performance, creating a need for early detection methods to support mental health strategies in workplace settings.

Method: Used three supervised algorithms (KNN, Random Forest, SVM) on the HackerEarth Employee Burnout Challenge dataset, evaluated through 30-fold cross-validation with R2 metric, and developed an interactive Streamlit interface for practical use.

Result: SVM achieved the highest predictive performance with R2=0.84 and was statistically superior to KNN and Random Forest based on paired t-tests.

Conclusion: Machine learning shows strong potential for early burnout detection and can support data-driven mental health strategies in organizational contexts through practical, accessible interfaces.

Abstract: Burnout is a psychological syndrome marked by emotional exhaustion,
depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment, with a significant
impact on individual well-being and organizational performance. This study
proposes a machine learning approach to predict burnout risk using the
HackerEarth Employee Burnout Challenge dataset. Three supervised algorithms
were evaluated: nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest, and support vector
machine (SVM), with model performance evaluated through 30-fold
cross-validation using the determination coefficient (R2). Among the models
tested, SVM achieved the highest predictive performance (R2 = 0.84) and was
statistically superior to KNN and Random Forest based on paired $t$-tests. To
ensure practical applicability, an interactive interface was developed using
Streamlit, allowing non-technical users to input data and receive burnout risk
predictions. The results highlight the potential of machine learning to support
early detection of burnout and promote data-driven mental health strategies in
organizational settings.

### [146] [FaCT: Faithful Concept Traces for Explaining Neural Network Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25512)
*Amin Parchami-Araghi,Sukrut Rao,Jonas Fischer,Bernt Schiele*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new model with model-inherent mechanistic concept-explanations that are faithful to the model, shared across classes, and can be traced from any layer to the logit with input-visualization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept-based explanation methods for deep networks are not always faithful to the model and make restrictive assumptions about concepts (class-specificity, small spatial extent, alignment to human expectations). There's a need for more faithful concept-based explanations.

Method: Proposes a new model with model-inherent mechanistic concept-explanations where concepts are shared across classes and their contribution to logits can be faithfully traced from any layer along with input-visualization. Also introduces C²-Score using foundation models to evaluate concept consistency.

Result: The proposed concepts are quantitatively more consistent than prior work, users find them more interpretable, and the model retains competitive ImageNet performance.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that faithful, model-inherent concept explanations can be achieved while maintaining competitive performance, providing more reliable and interpretable concept-based understanding of deep networks.

Abstract: Deep networks have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks,
yet getting a global concept-level understanding of how they function remains a
key challenge. Many post-hoc concept-based approaches have been introduced to
understand their workings, yet they are not always faithful to the model.
Further, they make restrictive assumptions on the concepts a model learns, such
as class-specificity, small spatial extent, or alignment to human expectations.
In this work, we put emphasis on the faithfulness of such concept-based
explanations and propose a new model with model-inherent mechanistic
concept-explanations. Our concepts are shared across classes and, from any
layer, their contribution to the logit and their input-visualization can be
faithfully traced. We also leverage foundation models to propose a new
concept-consistency metric, C$^2$-Score, that can be used to evaluate
concept-based methods. We show that, compared to prior work, our concepts are
quantitatively more consistent and users find our concepts to be more
interpretable, all while retaining competitive ImageNet performance.

### [147] [Transformers Provably Learn Directed Acyclic Graphs via Kernel-Guided Mutual Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25542)
*Yuan Cheng,Yu Huang,Zhe Xiong,Yingbin Liang,Vincent Y. F. Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel information-theoretic metric called kernel-guided mutual information (KG-MI) to enable transformers to provably learn directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with multiple parents per node, overcoming previous limitations that restricted theoretical guarantees to tree-like graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transformer-based models have strong empirical success in capturing graph dependencies but theoretical understanding is limited to tree-like graphs where each node has only one parent. Extending provable guarantees to general DAGs with multiple parents per node remains challenging due to difficulties in designing training objectives that enable attention heads to learn multiple parent relationships separately.

Method: The authors propose a novel information-theoretic metric (KG-MI) based on f-divergence and combine it with a multi-head attention framework. Each attention head is associated with a distinct marginal transition kernel to model diverse parent-child dependencies. They use gradient ascent training for single-layer multi-head transformers.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows that given sequences generated by a K-parent DAG, training converges to global optimum in polynomial time. When using KL divergence specifically, the learned attention scores accurately reflect the ground-truth adjacency matrix, provably recovering the underlying graph structure. Experimental results validate these theoretical findings.

Conclusion: The proposed KG-MI objective enables transformers to provably learn general DAG structures with multiple parents per node, extending theoretical guarantees beyond tree-like graphs and providing a principled approach for graph structure recovery using attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Uncovering hidden graph structures underlying real-world data is a critical
challenge with broad applications across scientific domains. Recently,
transformer-based models leveraging the attention mechanism have demonstrated
strong empirical success in capturing complex dependencies within graphs.
However, the theoretical understanding of their training dynamics has been
limited to tree-like graphs, where each node depends on a single parent.
Extending provable guarantees to more general directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) --
which involve multiple parents per node -- remains challenging, primarily due
to the difficulty in designing training objectives that enable different
attention heads to separately learn multiple different parent relationships.
  In this work, we address this problem by introducing a novel
information-theoretic metric: the kernel-guided mutual information (KG-MI),
based on the $f$-divergence. Our objective combines KG-MI with a multi-head
attention framework, where each head is associated with a distinct marginal
transition kernel to model diverse parent-child dependencies effectively. We
prove that, given sequences generated by a $K$-parent DAG, training a
single-layer, multi-head transformer via gradient ascent converges to the
global optimum in polynomial time. Furthermore, we characterize the attention
score patterns at convergence. In addition, when particularizing the
$f$-divergence to the KL divergence, the learned attention scores accurately
reflect the ground-truth adjacency matrix, thereby provably recovering the
underlying graph structure. Experimental results validate our theoretical
findings.

### [148] [Hybrid Quantum-Classical Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25557)
*Wenduan Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid quantum-classical recurrent neural network (QRNN) where the recurrent core is a parametrized quantum circuit (PQC) that maintains quantum states as hidden states, with classical feedforward networks providing nonlinear control and processing mid-circuit measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a physically consistent quantum RNN that leverages the exponential capacity of quantum state spaces for memory while incorporating classical nonlinearity and measurement-based observation, unifying quantum memory with classical control.

Method: The QRNN uses an n-qubit PQC as recurrent core with quantum states as hidden states. Mid-circuit measurements provide readouts combined with input embeddings, processed by classical feedforward networks that parametrize the PQC for unitary state updates. Projective measurements enable coherent quantum memory while obtaining classical outputs.

Result: The model achieved competitive performance against classical baselines on sentiment analysis, MNIST, permuted MNIST, copying memory, language modeling, and machine translation tasks (with soft attention mechanism) using up to 14 qubits in simulation.

Conclusion: This is the first quantum-grounded model to achieve competitive performance across diverse sequence-learning tasks, demonstrating the viability of hybrid quantum-classical architectures that combine quantum memory capacity with classical nonlinear control.

Abstract: We present a hybrid quantum-classical recurrent neural network (QRNN)
architecture in which the entire recurrent core is realized as a parametrized
quantum circuit (PQC) controlled by a classical feedforward network. The hidden
state is the quantum state of an $n$-qubit PQC, residing in an exponentially
large Hilbert space $\mathbb{C}^{2^n}$. The PQC is unitary by construction,
making the hidden-state evolution norm-preserving without external constraints.
At each timestep, mid-circuit readouts are combined with the input embedding
and processed by the feedforward network, which provides explicit classical
nonlinearity. The outputs parametrize the PQC, which updates the hidden state
via unitary dynamics. The QRNN is compact and physically consistent, and it
unifies (i) unitary recurrence as a high-capacity memory, (ii) partial
observation via mid-circuit measurements, and (iii) nonlinear classical control
for input-conditioned parametrization. We evaluate the model in simulation with
up to 14 qubits on sentiment analysis, MNIST, permuted MNIST, copying memory,
and language modeling, adopting projective measurements as a limiting case to
obtain mid-circuit readouts while maintaining a coherent recurrent quantum
memory. We further devise a soft attention mechanism over the mid-circuit
readouts in a sequence-to-sequence model and show its effectiveness for machine
translation. To our knowledge, this is the first model (RNN or otherwise)
grounded in quantum operations to achieve competitive performance against
strong classical baselines across a broad class of sequence-learning tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study adapts Aurora, a deep learning model originally for atmospheric forecasting, to predict sea surface temperature in the Canary Upwelling System using fine-tuning with oceanographic data, achieving high accuracy with low computational demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ocean forecasting models have high computational costs and scalability limitations, while accurate ocean variable prediction is crucial for climate change understanding, marine resource management, and maritime activities.

Method: Fine-tuning the Aurora deep learning model with high-resolution oceanographic reanalysis data using a staged fine-tuning process, latitude-weighted error metrics, and hyperparameter optimization.

Result: The model achieved low RMSE of 0.119K and high anomaly correlation coefficients (ACC ≈ 0.997), successfully reproducing large-scale SST structures but struggling with finer coastal details.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the feasibility of using deep learning models pre-trained in different domains for oceanic applications, with future improvements including additional variables, higher resolution, and physics-informed neural networks for better climate modeling and ocean prediction.

Abstract: The accurate prediction of oceanographic variables is crucial for
understanding climate change, managing marine resources, and optimizing
maritime activities. Traditional ocean forecasting relies on numerical models;
however, these approaches face limitations in terms of computational cost and
scalability. In this study, we adapt Aurora, a foundational deep learning model
originally designed for atmospheric forecasting, to predict sea surface
temperature (SST) in the Canary Upwelling System. By fine-tuning this model
with high-resolution oceanographic reanalysis data, we demonstrate its ability
to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns while reducing computational
demands. Our methodology involves a staged fine-tuning process, incorporating
latitude-weighted error metrics and optimizing hyperparameters for efficient
learning. The experimental results show that the model achieves a low RMSE of
0.119K, maintaining high anomaly correlation coefficients (ACC $\approx
0.997$). The model successfully reproduces large-scale SST structures but faces
challenges in capturing finer details in coastal regions. This work contributes
to the field of data-driven ocean forecasting by demonstrating the feasibility
of using deep learning models pre-trained in different domains for oceanic
applications. Future improvements include integrating additional oceanographic
variables, increasing spatial resolution, and exploring physics-informed neural
networks to enhance interpretability and understanding. These advancements can
improve climate modeling and ocean prediction accuracy, supporting
decision-making in environmental and economic sectors.

### [150] [A Framework for Bounding Deterministic Risk with PAC-Bayes: Applications to Majority Votes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25569)
*Benjamin Leblanc,Pascal Germain*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework to extract deterministic hypothesis guarantees from stochastic PAC-Bayesian bounds, enabling practical deployment of single deterministic classifiers with improved generalization bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical PAC-Bayes only provides guarantees for randomly sampled hypotheses, requiring stochastic predictions at test time, which is impractical for many real-world applications that need deterministic classifiers.

Method: Proposed unified framework with general oracle bound, numerical bound, and specialization to majority vote to extract single hypothesis guarantees from stochastic PAC-Bayesian guarantees.

Result: Empirical results show consistent outperformance of popular baselines (up to 2x improvement) for generalization bounds on deterministic classifiers.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the gap between theoretical PAC-Bayesian guarantees and practical deterministic classifier deployment, providing tighter generalization bounds for real-world applications.

Abstract: PAC-Bayes is a popular and efficient framework for obtaining generalization
guarantees in situations involving uncountable hypothesis spaces.
Unfortunately, in its classical formulation, it only provides guarantees on the
expected risk of a randomly sampled hypothesis. This requires stochastic
predictions at test time, making PAC-Bayes unusable in many practical
situations where a single deterministic hypothesis must be deployed. We propose
a unified framework to extract guarantees holding for a single hypothesis from
stochastic PAC-Bayesian guarantees. We present a general oracle bound and
derive from it a numerical bound and a specialization to majority vote. We
empirically show that our approach consistently outperforms popular baselines
(by up to a factor of 2) when it comes to generalization bounds on
deterministic classifiers.

*Phuc Tran,Nisheeth K. Vishnoi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the spectral-norm robustness of low-rank pseudoinverses under noisy observations, deriving sharp perturbation bounds that improve over classical approaches by up to √n factor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-rank pseudoinverses are widely used in machine learning and scientific computing, but their robustness to noise in real-world matrices (from sampling, sketching, quantization) remains poorly understood.

Method: Systematic study using contour integral techniques applied to the non-entire function f(z)=1/z, analyzing spectral-norm error between noisy and true low-rank inverse approximations under mild noise assumptions.

Result: Derived sharp non-asymptotic perturbation bounds that scale with eigengap, spectral decay, and noise alignment with low-curvature directions. Bounds closely track true perturbation error in experiments and improve over classical approaches by up to √n factor.

Conclusion: The analysis provides practical, spectrum-aware guarantees for low-rank inverse approximations in noisy computational environments, offering significant improvements over traditional bounds.

Abstract: Low-rank pseudoinverses are widely used to approximate matrix inverses in
scalable machine learning, optimization, and scientific computing. However,
real-world matrices are often observed with noise, arising from sampling,
sketching, and quantization. The spectral-norm robustness of low-rank inverse
approximations remains poorly understood. We systematically study the
spectral-norm error $\| (\tilde{A}^{-1})_p - A_p^{-1} \|$ for an $n\times n$
symmetric matrix $A$, where $A_p^{-1}$ denotes the best rank-\(p\)
approximation of $A^{-1}$, and $\tilde{A} = A + E$ is a noisy observation.
Under mild assumptions on the noise, we derive sharp non-asymptotic
perturbation bounds that reveal how the error scales with the eigengap,
spectral decay, and noise alignment with low-curvature directions of $A$. Our
analysis introduces a novel application of contour integral techniques to the
\emph{non-entire} function $f(z) = 1/z$, yielding bounds that improve over
naive adaptations of classical full-inverse bounds by up to a factor of
$\sqrt{n}$. Empirically, our bounds closely track the true perturbation error
across a variety of real-world and synthetic matrices, while estimates based on
classical results tend to significantly overpredict. These findings offer
practical, spectrum-aware guarantees for low-rank inverse approximations in
noisy computational environments.

*Tam Le,Truyen Nguyen,Hideitsu Hino,Kenji Fukumizu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a generalization of Sobolev IPM using Orlicz geometric structure to overcome limitations of L^p geometry, establishes a theoretical connection to Musielak norm for regularization, and achieves computational efficiency through univariate optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitation of Sobolev IPM being intrinsically bound to L^p geometric structure, which restricts incorporation of alternative structural priors beyond the L^p geometry paradigm.

Method: Generalize Sobolev IPM through Orlicz geometric structure using convex functions, establish connection between Orlicz-Sobolev norm and Musielak norm for regularization, and exploit graph structure to reduce the problem to univariate optimization.

Result: GSI-M achieves several-order faster computation than Orlicz-Wasserstein (OW) and demonstrates practical advantages in document classification and topological data analysis tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed GSI-M framework successfully generalizes Sobolev IPM beyond L^p geometry while achieving remarkable computational efficiency through theoretical connections and graph structure exploitation.

Abstract: We study the Sobolev IPM problem for measures supported on a graph metric
space, where critic function is constrained to lie within the unit ball defined
by Sobolev norm. While Le et al. (2025) achieved scalable computation by
relating Sobolev norm to weighted $L^p$-norm, the resulting framework remains
intrinsically bound to $L^p$ geometric structure, limiting its ability to
incorporate alternative structural priors beyond the $L^p$ geometry paradigm.
To overcome this limitation, we propose to generalize Sobolev IPM through the
lens of \emph{Orlicz geometric structure}, which employs convex functions to
capture nuanced geometric relationships, building upon recent advances in
optimal transport theory -- particularly Orlicz-Wasserstein (OW) and
generalized Sobolev transport -- that have proven instrumental in advancing
machine learning methodologies. This generalization encompasses classical
Sobolev IPM as a special case while accommodating diverse geometric priors
beyond traditional $L^p$ structure. It however brings up significant
computational hurdles that compound those already inherent in Sobolev IPM. To
address these challenges, we establish a novel theoretical connection between
Orlicz-Sobolev norm and Musielak norm which facilitates a novel regularization
for the generalized Sobolev IPM (GSI). By further exploiting the underlying
graph structure, we show that GSI with Musielak regularization (GSI-M) reduces
to a simple \emph{univariate optimization} problem, achieving remarkably
computational efficiency. Empirically, GSI-M is several-order faster than the
popular OW in computation, and demonstrates its practical advantages in
comparing probability measures on a given graph for document classification and
several tasks in topological data analysis.

*Arani Roy,Marco P. Apolinario,Shristi Das Biswas,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A structured local learning framework that trains DNNs on low-rank manifolds using SVD decomposition, achieving BP-comparable accuracy with reduced parameters and memory requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of BP (high memory/computation) and DFA (poor scalability in deep CNNs) by enabling efficient local learning on low-rank manifolds.

Method: Train layers in decomposed SVD form with composite loss (cross-entropy + subspace alignment + orthogonality regularization), using structured feedback matrices that match SVD structure.

Result: Achieves accuracy comparable to BP on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet while reducing trainable parameters without pruning or compression.

Conclusion: Local learning on low-rank manifolds provides a principled and scalable alternative to full-rank gradient-based training.

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) with backpropagation (BP) achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy but requires global error propagation and full
parameterization, leading to substantial memory and computational overhead.
Direct Feedback Alignment (DFA) enables local, parallelizable updates with
lower memory requirements but is limited by unstructured feedback and poor
scalability in deeper architectures, specially convolutional neural networks.
To address these limitations, we propose a structured local learning framework
that operates directly on low-rank manifolds defined by the Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) of weight matrices. Each layer is trained in its decomposed
form, with updates applied to the SVD components using a composite loss that
integrates cross-entropy, subspace alignment, and orthogonality regularization.
Feedback matrices are constructed to match the SVD structure, ensuring
consistent alignment between forward and feedback pathways. Our method reduces
the number of trainable parameters relative to the original DFA model, without
relying on pruning or post hoc compression. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and ImageNet show that our method achieves accuracy comparable to that of BP.
Ablation studies confirm the importance of each loss term in the low-rank
setting. These results establish local learning on low-rank manifolds as a
principled and scalable alternative to full-rank gradient-based training.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a family of uncertainty measures for regression tasks based on proper scoring rules, particularly kernel scores, to address the gap in uncertainty quantification literature that has been largely focused on classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Regression tasks in safety-critical domains require proper uncertainty quantification, but existing literature remains largely classification-focused, creating a need for principled uncertainty measures for regression.

Method: The framework uses proper scoring rules with emphasis on kernel scores to design measures for total, aleatoric, and epistemic uncertainty, unifying existing measures and providing guidelines for creating new ones with specific behavioral characteristics.

Result: The authors prove explicit correspondences between kernel-score characteristics and downstream behavior, and extensive experiments show the measures are effective in downstream tasks while revealing trade-offs among different instantiations.

Conclusion: The proposed kernel-based uncertainty measures provide a principled framework for regression uncertainty quantification with customizable behavior through kernel choice, offering concrete design guidelines and demonstrating effectiveness in practical applications.

Abstract: Regression tasks, notably in safety-critical domains, require proper
uncertainty quantification, yet the literature remains largely
classification-focused. In this light, we introduce a family of measures for
total, aleatoric, and epistemic uncertainty based on proper scoring rules, with
a particular emphasis on kernel scores. The framework unifies several
well-known measures and provides a principled recipe for designing new ones
whose behavior, such as tail sensitivity, robustness, and out-of-distribution
responsiveness, is governed by the choice of kernel. We prove explicit
correspondences between kernel-score characteristics and downstream behavior,
yielding concrete design guidelines for task-specific measures. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that these measures are effective in downstream tasks
and reveal clear trade-offs among instantiations, including robustness and
out-of-distribution detection performance.

### [155] [INT v.s. FP: A Comprehensive Study of Fine-Grained Low-bit Quantization Formats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25602)
*Mengzhao Chen,Meng Wu,Hui Jin,Zhihang Yuan,Jing Liu,Chaoyi Zhang,Yunshui Li,Jie Huang,Jin Ma,Zeyue Xue,Zhiheng Liu,Xingyan Bin,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper systematically compares floating-point (FP) and integer (INT) quantization formats for AI hardware, revealing that FP excels in coarse-grained quantization while INT formats like MXINT8 perform better for fine-grained 8-bit quantization in both accuracy and hardware efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide clear guidance for algorithm and hardware co-design by conducting a unified comparison of FP and INT quantization across varying granularities, addressing the gap in understanding the trade-offs between these formats in modern AI hardware.

Method: The authors systematically investigate FP vs INT format trade-offs, analyze performance crossover points, compare 8-bit and 4-bit formats, introduce symmetric clipping for gradient bias resolution in INT training, and apply outlier-mitigation techniques like Hadamard rotation.

Result: Results show MXINT8 outperforms FP counterparts in 8-bit fine-grained quantization for both accuracy and hardware efficiency. For 4-bit formats, FP often has accuracy advantages, but NVINT4 can surpass NVFP4 with outlier mitigation. Symmetric clipping enables nearly lossless MXINT8 training.

Conclusion: The findings challenge current hardware trends favoring FP, demonstrating that fine-grained INT formats like MXINT8 offer better accuracy, power, and efficiency balance for future AI accelerators, and that a one-size-fits-all FP approach is suboptimal.

Abstract: Modern AI hardware, such as Nvidia's Blackwell architecture, is increasingly
embracing low-precision floating-point (FP) formats to handle the pervasive
activation outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite this industry
trend, a unified comparison of FP and integer (INT) quantization across varying
granularities has been missing, leaving algorithm and hardware co-design
without clear guidance. This paper fills that gap by systematically
investigating the trade-offs between FP and INT formats. We reveal a critical
performance crossover: while FP excels in coarse-grained quantization, the
comparison at fine-grained (block-wise) levels is more nuanced. Our
comprehensive comparison demonstrates that for popular 8-bit fine-grained
formats (e.g., MX with block size 32), MXINT8 is superior to its FP counterpart
in both algorithmic accuracy and hardware efficiency. However, for 4-bit
formats, FP (e.g., MXFP4, NVFP4) often holds an accuracy advantage , though we
show that NVINT4 can surpass NVFP4 when outlier-mitigation techniques like
Hadamard rotation are applied. We also introduce a symmetric clipping method
that resolves gradient bias in fine-grained low-bit INT training, enabling
nearly lossless performance for MXINT8 training. These findings challenge the
current hardware trajectory, demonstrating that a one-size-fits-all FP approach
is suboptimal and advocating that fine-grained INT formats, particularly
MXINT8, offer a better balance of accuracy, power, and efficiency for future AI
accelerators.

Conclusion: BOLT is a broadly applicable principle for enhancing GAN training, providing better stability and performance compared to standard WGAN approaches.

Abstract: We introduce BOLT-GAN, a simple yet effective modification of the WGAN
framework inspired by the Bayes Optimal Learning Threshold (BOLT). We show that
with a Lipschitz continuous discriminator, BOLT-GAN implicitly minimizes a
different metric distance than the Earth Mover (Wasserstein) distance and
achieves better training stability. Empirical evaluations on four standard
image generation benchmarks (CIFAR-10, CelebA-64, LSUN Bedroom-64, and LSUN
Church-64) show that BOLT-GAN consistently outperforms WGAN, achieving 10-60%
lower Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Our results suggest that BOLT is a
broadly applicable principle for enhancing GAN training.

*Nikita Kachaev,Mikhail Kolosov,Daniil Zelezetsky,Alexey K. Kovalev,Aleksandr I. Panov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates how Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models lose their original vision-language capabilities during action fine-tuning, and proposes methods to mitigate this degradation while improving out-of-distribution generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) retain their world knowledge and vision-language grounding when adapted to action tasks, and to address the degradation of visual representations during VLA fine-tuning.

Method: Systematic study of representation retention during VLA fine-tuning using probing of hidden representations and attention maps, plus targeted tasks to compare VLA models with VLMs. Evaluated various visual representation alignment strategies and introduced a simple effective method to mitigate degradation.

Result: Naive action fine-tuning leads to degradation of visual representations. The proposed method successfully mitigates this degradation and yields improved generalization to out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: The analysis clarifies the trade-off between action fine-tuning and VL representation degradation, and provides practical approaches to recover inherited VL capabilities while maintaining action performance.

Abstract: The growing success of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models stems from the
promise that pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can endow agents with
transferable world knowledge and vision-language (VL) grounding, laying a
foundation for action models with broader generalization. Yet when these VLMs
are adapted to the action modality, it remains unclear to what extent their
original VL representations and knowledge are preserved. In this work, we
conduct a systematic study of representation retention during VLA fine-tuning,
showing that naive action fine-tuning leads to degradation of visual
representations. To characterize and measure these effects, we probe VLA's
hidden representations and analyze attention maps, further, we design a set of
targeted tasks and methods that contrast VLA models with their counterpart
VLMs, isolating changes in VL capabilities induced by action fine-tuning. We
further evaluate a range of strategies for aligning visual representations and
introduce a simple yet effective method that mitigates degradation and yields
improved generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Taken together,
our analysis clarifies the trade-off between action fine-tuning and the
degradation of VL representations and highlights practical approaches to
recover inherited VL capabilities. Code is publicly available:

*Javad Aliakbari,Johan Östman,Ashkan Panahi,Alexandre Graell i Amat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedLap is a novel federated learning framework for graph-structured data that uses Laplacian smoothing in the spectral domain to capture inter-node dependencies while ensuring privacy and scalability, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated learning approaches for interconnected subgraphs either exchange sensitive node embeddings (privacy risks) or rely on computationally-intensive steps (scalability issues).

Method: Leverages global structure information via Laplacian smoothing in the spectral domain to effectively capture inter-node dependencies.

Result: Extensive experiments show FedLap achieves competitive or superior utility compared to existing techniques while providing strong privacy guarantees.

Conclusion: FedLap is the first subgraph federated learning scheme with strong privacy guarantees that effectively addresses privacy and scalability challenges in graph-structured federated learning.

Abstract: We consider the problem of federated learning (FL) with graph-structured data
distributed across multiple clients. In particular, we address the prevalent
scenario of interconnected subgraphs, where interconnections between clients
significantly influence the learning process. Existing approaches suffer from
critical limitations, either requiring the exchange of sensitive node
embeddings, thereby posing privacy risks, or relying on
computationally-intensive steps, which hinders scalability. To tackle these
challenges, we propose FedLap, a novel framework that leverages global
structure information via Laplacian smoothing in the spectral domain to
effectively capture inter-node dependencies while ensuring privacy and
scalability. We provide a formal analysis of the privacy of FedLap,
demonstrating that it preserves privacy. Notably, FedLap is the first subgraph
FL scheme with strong privacy guarantees. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that FedLap achieves competitive or superior utility
compared to existing techniques.

### [159] [Spectral Perturbation Bounds for Low-Rank Approximation with Applications to Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25670)
*Phuc Tran,Nisheeth K. Vishnoi,Van H. Vu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper establishes new high-probability spectral-norm perturbation bounds for symmetric matrices, refining classical results and providing improved utility guarantees for differentially private PCA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how noise affects low-rank approximations in spectral norm, which captures worst-case directional error and provides stronger utility guarantees than Frobenius norm for differentially private applications.

Method: Develops a novel contour bootstrapping method from complex analysis to derive spectral-norm perturbation bounds, extending it to spectral functionals including polynomials and matrix exponentials.

Result: The bounds yield sharp estimates for spectral norm error with improvements up to a factor of √n, resolving an open problem in differentially private PCA literature.

Conclusion: The proposed spectral-norm bounds closely track actual error in real-world datasets and provide improved utility guarantees for privacy-preserving machine learning applications.

Abstract: A central challenge in machine learning is to understand how noise or
measurement errors affect low-rank approximations, particularly in the spectral
norm. This question is especially important in differentially private low-rank
approximation, where one aims to preserve the top-$p$ structure of a
data-derived matrix while ensuring privacy. Prior work often analyzes Frobenius
norm error or changes in reconstruction quality, but these metrics can over- or
under-estimate true subspace distortion. The spectral norm, by contrast,
captures worst-case directional error and provides the strongest utility
guarantees. We establish new high-probability spectral-norm perturbation bounds
for symmetric matrices that refine the classical Eckart--Young--Mirsky theorem
and explicitly capture interactions between a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n
\times n}$ and an arbitrary symmetric perturbation $E$. Under mild eigengap and
norm conditions, our bounds yield sharp estimates for $\|(A + E)_p - A_p\|$,
where $A_p$ is the best rank-$p$ approximation of $A$, with improvements of up
to a factor of $\sqrt{n}$. As an application, we derive improved utility
guarantees for differentially private PCA, resolving an open problem in the
literature. Our analysis relies on a novel contour bootstrapping method from
complex analysis and extends it to a broad class of spectral functionals,
including polynomials and matrix exponentials. Empirical results on real-world
datasets confirm that our bounds closely track the actual spectral error under
diverse perturbation regimes.

### [160] [Mechanistic Interpretability of RNNs emulating Hidden Markov Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25674)
*Elia Torre,Michele Viscione,Lucas Pompe,Benjamin F Grewe,Valerio Mante*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RNNs can replicate HMM emission statistics and implement probabilistic computations through noise-sustained dynamics along closed orbits, with structured connectivity featuring 'kick neurons' that enable transitions between discrete latent states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how RNNs can generate richer, spontaneous, and stochastic behaviors observed in natural settings, which contrasts with their typical use for simple, input-driven deterministic behaviors.

Method: Train RNNs to replicate HMM emission statistics, then reverse-engineer the trained networks to uncover the mechanisms they implement, analyzing across multiple HMM architectures (fully connected, cyclic, and linear-chain).

Result: RNNs develop noise-sustained dynamics along closed orbits when driven by stochastic input, with transitions governed by regions of slow noise-driven dynamics connected by fast deterministic transitions. They develop highly structured connectivity with 'kick neurons' that initiate transitions, operating in a regime of stochastic resonance.

Conclusion: RNNs can emulate complex discrete latent dynamics through a compositional principle involving modular reuse of the same dynamical motif, enabling them to perform probabilistic computations and replicate HMM-like behaviors.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) provide a powerful approach in neuroscience
to infer latent dynamics in neural populations and to generate hypotheses about
the neural computations underlying behavior. However, past work has focused on
relatively simple, input-driven, and largely deterministic behaviors - little
is known about the mechanisms that would allow RNNs to generate the richer,
spontaneous, and potentially stochastic behaviors observed in natural settings.
Modeling with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) has revealed a segmentation of
natural behaviors into discrete latent states with stochastic transitions
between them, a type of dynamics that may appear at odds with the continuous
state spaces implemented by RNNs. Here we first show that RNNs can replicate
HMM emission statistics and then reverse-engineer the trained networks to
uncover the mechanisms they implement. In the absence of inputs, the activity
of trained RNNs collapses towards a single fixed point. When driven by
stochastic input, trajectories instead exhibit noise-sustained dynamics along
closed orbits. Rotation along these orbits modulates the emission probabilities
and is governed by transitions between regions of slow, noise-driven dynamics
connected by fast, deterministic transitions. The trained RNNs develop highly
structured connectivity, with a small set of "kick neurons" initiating
transitions between these regions. This mechanism emerges during training as
the network shifts into a regime of stochastic resonance, enabling it to
perform probabilistic computations. Analyses across multiple HMM architectures
- fully connected, cyclic, and linear-chain - reveal that this solution
generalizes through the modular reuse of the same dynamical motif, suggesting a
compositional principle by which RNNs can emulate complex discrete latent
dynamics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GNSS is a Graph Neural Network framework for surrogate modeling of dynamic structural problems, featuring local frame kinematics, sign-aware loss, and wavelength-informed connectivity to accurately simulate wave-dominated structural dynamics with significant speedup over finite element methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While GNNs have been explored for computational fluid dynamics, little attention has been given to structural problems, especially dynamic cases. The authors aim to address this gap by developing a GNN framework specifically for dynamic structural simulations.

Method: GNSS follows the encode-process-decode paradigm with three key features: (i) node kinematics in node-fixed local frames to avoid catastrophic cancellation, (ii) sign-aware regression loss to reduce phase errors, and (iii) wavelength-informed connectivity radius for optimized graph construction.

Result: GNSS accurately reproduces physics over hundreds of timesteps and generalizes to unseen loading conditions, where existing GNNs fail. It achieves substantial inference speedups compared to explicit finite element baselines while preserving spatial and temporal fidelity.

Conclusion: Locality-preserving GNNs with physics-consistent update rules are a competitive alternative for dynamic, wave-dominated structural simulations, demonstrating the viability of GNN-based surrogate models for structural dynamics.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been explored as surrogate models
for numerical simulations. While their applications in computational fluid
dynamics have been investigated, little attention has been given to structural
problems, especially for dynamic cases. To address this gap, we introduce the
Graph Network-based Structural Simulator (GNSS), a GNN framework for surrogate
modeling of dynamic structural problems.
  GNSS follows the encode-process-decode paradigm typical of GNN-based machine
learning models, and its design makes it particularly suited for dynamic
simulations thanks to three key features: (i) expressing node kinematics in
node-fixed local frames, which avoids catastrophic cancellation in
finite-difference velocities; (ii) employing a sign-aware regression loss,
which reduces phase errors in long rollouts; and (iii) using a
wavelength-informed connectivity radius, which optimizes graph construction.
  We evaluate GNSS on a case study involving a beam excited by a 50kHz
Hanning-modulated pulse. The results show that GNSS accurately reproduces the
physics of the problem over hundreds of timesteps and generalizes to unseen
loading conditions, where existing GNNs fail to converge or deliver meaningful
predictions.
  Compared with explicit finite element baselines, GNSS achieves substantial
inference speedups while preserving spatial and temporal fidelity. These
findings demonstrate that locality-preserving GNNs with physics-consistent
update rules are a competitive alternative for dynamic, wave-dominated
structural simulations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CS-GRU, a Convolutional Spiking GRU cell that combines spiking neural networks with convolutional operations to better capture local dependencies in temporal and spatio-temporal data, outperforming existing GRU variants with higher accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RNNs lose local details in long sequences, and previous approaches like SpikGRU fail to capture fine-grained local dependencies in event-based spatio-temporal data, creating a need for better local structure preservation.

Method: Developed a Convolutional Spiking GRU (CS-GRU) cell that integrates convolutional operations with spiking neurons and GRU gating mechanisms to preserve local structure and dependencies while maintaining temporal precision.

Result: CS-GRU outperforms state-of-the-art GRU variants by an average of 4.35%, achieving over 90% accuracy on sequential tasks and up to 99.31% on MNIST, with 69% higher efficiency compared to SpikGRU.

Conclusion: The CS-GRU architecture provides a versatile and efficient solution for processing both temporal and spatio-temporal data, successfully preserving local dependencies while leveraging the benefits of spiking neurons and gated recurrent units.

Abstract: Spike-based temporal messaging enables SNNs to efficiently process both
purely temporal and spatio-temporal time-series or event-driven data. Combining
SNNs with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), a variant of recurrent neural networks,
gives rise to a robust framework for sequential data processing; however,
traditional RNNs often lose local details when handling long sequences.
Previous approaches, such as SpikGRU, fail to capture fine-grained local
dependencies in event-based spatio-temporal data. In this paper, we introduce
the Convolutional Spiking GRU (CS-GRU) cell, which leverages convolutional
operations to preserve local structure and dependencies while integrating the
temporal precision of spiking neurons with the efficient gating mechanisms of
GRUs. This versatile architecture excels on both temporal datasets (NTIDIGITS,
SHD) and spatio-temporal benchmarks (MNIST, DVSGesture, CIFAR10DVS). Our
experiments show that CS-GRU outperforms state-of-the-art GRU variants by an
average of 4.35%, achieving over 90% accuracy on sequential tasks and up to
99.31% on MNIST. It is worth noting that our solution achieves 69% higher
efficiency compared to SpikGRU. The code is available at:

TL;DR: LieSolver uses Lie symmetries to enforce PDEs exactly, improving accuracy and convergence for initial-boundary value problems while enabling rigorous error estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more efficient and reliable method for solving PDE-constrained problems that outperforms existing approaches like physics-informed neural networks (PINNs).

Method: Leverages Lie symmetry transformations to enforce PDEs exactly by construction, incorporating physical laws directly into the model and learning solutions from initial and boundary data.

Result: LieSolver is faster and more accurate than PINNs for linear homogeneous PDEs with various initial conditions, producing compact models that facilitate efficient optimization.

Conclusion: The method improves computational efficiency and prediction reliability for PDE-constrained problems while enabling rigorous error estimation for well-posed IBVPs.

Abstract: We introduce a method for efficiently solving initial-boundary value problems
(IBVPs) that uses Lie symmetries to enforce the associated partial differential
equation (PDE) exactly by construction. By leveraging symmetry transformations,
the model inherently incorporates the physical laws and learns solutions from
initial and boundary data. As a result, the loss directly measures the model's
accuracy, leading to improved convergence. Moreover, for well-posed IBVPs, our
method enables rigorous error estimation. The approach yields compact models,
facilitating an efficient optimization. We implement LieSolver and demonstrate
its application to linear homogeneous PDEs with a range of initial conditions,
showing that it is faster and more accurate than physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs). Overall, our method improves both computational efficiency
and the reliability of predictions for PDE-constrained problems.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes limitations of conventional Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods in medical imaging that ignore contextual relationships between adjacent instances (patches/slices), and shows newer correlated MIL methods still struggle to achieve optimal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional MIL approaches treat instances separately, ignoring contextual relationships between nearby patches or slices that are essential for accurate classification in medical imaging applications.

Method: The authors design a synthetic classification task where accounting for adjacent instance features is crucial, and compare performance of off-the-shelf MIL approaches against the optimal Bayes estimator available in closed-form.

Result: Both conventional and newer correlated MIL methods demonstrate limitations in generalizing well when trained from scratch on tens of thousands of instances, failing to achieve optimal performance.

Conclusion: Current MIL methods, including newer correlated approaches, still struggle to effectively capture and utilize contextual relationships between adjacent instances, highlighting the need for improved methods that can better leverage spatial dependencies in medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) is often used in medical imaging to classify
high-resolution 2D images by processing patches or classify 3D volumes by
processing slices. However, conventional MIL approaches treat instances
separately, ignoring contextual relationships such as the appearance of nearby
patches or slices that can be essential in real applications. We design a
synthetic classification task where accounting for adjacent instance features
is crucial for accurate prediction. We demonstrate the limitations of
off-the-shelf MIL approaches by quantifying their performance compared to the
optimal Bayes estimator for this task, which is available in closed-form. We
empirically show that newer correlated MIL methods still struggle to generalize
as well as possible when trained from scratch on tens of thousands of
instances.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SDE modeling requires costly numerical solvers for sampling between arbitrary time points, which is inefficient for noisy and irregularly sampled time series common in finance, physics, and machine learning.

Method: Introduce Neural Stochastic Flows (NSFs) and latent variants that directly learn SDE transition laws using conditional normalizing flows with architectural constraints preserving stochastic flow properties.

Result: NSFs achieve up to two orders of magnitude speed-up at large time gaps while maintaining distributional accuracy comparable to numerical approaches, demonstrated on synthetic SDE simulations and real-world tracking/video data.

Conclusion: NSFs provide an efficient alternative to traditional numerical SDE solvers, enabling fast one-shot sampling between arbitrary states while preserving accuracy, making them suitable for applications with irregular time series.

Abstract: Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are well suited to modelling noisy
and irregularly sampled time series found in finance, physics, and machine
learning. Traditional approaches require costly numerical solvers to sample
between arbitrary time points. We introduce Neural Stochastic Flows (NSFs) and
their latent variants, which directly learn (latent) SDE transition laws using
conditional normalising flows with architectural constraints that preserve
properties inherited from stochastic flows. This enables one-shot sampling
between arbitrary states and yields up to two orders of magnitude speed-ups at
large time gaps. Experiments on synthetic SDE simulations and on real-world
tracking and video data show that NSFs maintain distributional accuracy
comparable to numerical approaches while dramatically reducing computation for
arbitrary time-point sampling.
